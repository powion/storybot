not me but a guy i worked with years ago i guess it counts as a revenge i worked with a guy who really stuck it to his ex wife when i met him he was working in a sporting goods store making dollars an hour he was not really like the other retail monkeys he was older well groomed well spoken clearly educated etc one night after work he gets into his car and i couldnt help but notice that it was a very very nice newish jaguar i asked him how he could afford it and he explained it to me he had been an svp at a well known fortune company which i will not mention the name of pulling in k with bonuses and stock options he was married but the marriage fell apart and in the divorce she demanded that she get the house and of his wages he and his lawyer somehow managed to get her to agree to let him keep the house in exchange for of his payno dollar figure or employer specified lol as soon as she took the settlement he quit his job and looked for a minimum wage job he said to me that she gets of nearly nothing now he had other money stashed away so he didnt even need the job and he had the house and its equity as well also no kids so there was no child support just alimony she was furious of course and tried to resue him but failed at least once and when she claimed that the settlement was not keeping her in the life style she was accustomed to he simply told the judge that the divorce was traumatic to him and he could no longer do his old job as a result at least at that time she did not manage to get out of the deal not sure how it all ended but i thought it was fucking brilliant if not crazylevel spiteful he was a good employee toogood with customers showed up on time no bullshit absenteeism or anything like that he claimed he loved each payday because it reminded him how little she was getting 
this story begins almost a year ago i received a call from an unknown number on my cell phone it was an automated message to call a number in regards to serving me papers i knew right away this may have been a collection agency googled the number and confirmed it now i have to disclose i did have identity theft almost years ago to this day i occasionally get calls from collection agencies trying to collect on some debt from years ago that was cleared now most of the time when i get these calls i ask for their address to send in a dispute letter including the accompanying data for proof that i had identity theft granted they should not be calling me but they apologize and i dont get another call plus they usually mail me back and said they closed the account well i go to call this person and i got to say the call was interesting this woman answered and i gave her my information she started rattling off a debt that was back in i let her finish and i told her that i had no knowledge and there was identity theft and as soon as i said that she freaked out she kept saying she knew the debt was mine and im going to pay i kept telling her that i wanted to mail a letter but she flat out refused when i told her i knew my rights she said that i had the right to pay the debt she then said that she is going to put a lien on my huge pretty house her words and she was describing the house to the letter she also said she is going to put a lien on my lexus that she sees in the drive way and she said that my gate in the front wont stop the repossession she then hung up now i knew better all she did was get my info from public records and then saw my house on google street view my guess is that she tried to push this intimidation on other people that know better so far it appeared to be a very disreputable company i also had phone recordings when i called in and they were legal as i asked her if phone calls can be recorded for quality control purposes she said of course and i said thank you ill take that as my consent i would of just let this go and just say this lady was crazy but i kept getting the automated phone calls and i couldnt block them as they were unknown i googled the company and i thought they were in ohio a couple of flags that led me to believe this was that the person who owned this company in ohio was being indicted with charges whom was an attorney i placed a complaint with the ohio attorney general they couldnt find any information on what i was submitting they did call the phone number i gave them and the attorney general told me they would stop from calling me but that is all the attorney general could do i also complained to the federal consumer finance bureau whom is supposed to be looking into these issues but they blew my off well three months later i called this number i had an idea of maybe pressing buttons when i called in to see if i could get more information about the company through the ivr well that paid off as soon as i pressed i got a different company name i googled that company and got tons of complaints this lead me to the company existing in ny i complained to the attorney general of ny with all of my info i done quite a bit of research over the next couple of weeks and found out a whole bunch of information such as the owner found out that the address where the company no longer received mail was at the owners address their facebook account etc i then got another one of those unknown phone calls but this time its a different company im sure you get what i am getting at the company just keeps changing the name but the parent company still calls i finally had enough of this i get a private investigator involved and they were quite satisfied with all the information i got so far so i let him do his business well he calls me back saying that this company isnt even registered and its ran by this one lady i find out the rude lady whom i am talking to is the supposed owner but not running a legitimate business i got a process server to file a claim in ny granted i think i could have done it where i was at but i was heading up to that area in ny anyway as i had some family reasonably close problem was she was not able to be served the house which she owned she was not able to be served at either she was not there or was staying somewhere else well my private investigator started sending out friend requests to her and the people in her friends lists well her friends and then she accepted the facebook request my private investigator found out that she cheated on her boyfriend about a month ago since she posted that crap the private investigator gave me an idea of trying to reach her boyfriend and if he can lead us to serve her i will give him well we did that and sure enough we were finally able to serve this lady at her parents house about miles from where she was at i fly up to ny and since its small claims its just me and this lady for some reason her mother is there too but she is not representing i give the judge all of my info i had over the months and how she broke the law she broke debt collection laws and threats over the phone after the judge heard all the trouble i had with these calls and how she hid her identity purposely the judge gave me the maximum amount of in ny small towns and villages are limited to after the case i heard her mother loudly whispering but i heard it you better hope he doesnt take your house your great grandfather built this with his own bare hands i was thinking hmmm it would be sweet revenge if i could actually put a lien on the house well lo and behold i found out the house had a second mortgage attached to it with the property value of the house and if it sold i wouldnt end up getting the lien money since the secondary mortgage was almost as much as the house i was then contemplating how i was going to get the money from this lady my private investigator calls me five months later and said her house is going into foreclosure i get a proxy to bid for me but as in most foreclosure actions the bank buys it back as an reo i decided to send in a low ball offer to buy the house a couple of months later the bank accepted my offer my guess is that its a small town and trying to get the right market was an issue you may be wondering why i even bought this house well heres why this bitch threatened to put a lien on my house with no merit well guess what i fucking took her house it was completely worth it it didnt cost me too much and i had the money the house is actually in decent shape just a little small plus it will be a nice summer home when i go to visit my relatives oh and i decided to rub in salt to the wound i sent a letter to her parents address letting them know i took the house i told them that if her daughter wouldnt be in the business of scamming people they may not have lost the house i also go to find out that the attorney general of ny is now investigating this lady i hope they throw the book at her not going to mention the collection agency but if you stopped getting phone calls from them youre welcome edit fixed some minor grammar since a couple of people were harping on me happy update im surprised this post got so much attention first of all for the people who gave gold thank you i know that some people are calling bull shit to my story all i can say is that this is true i tried to give as much detail as possible i just want to address all the people giving me a hard time over the grammar i didnt intend this to be a newspaper article everything was typed out free form as i wanted to get the entire story out there i apologize if that really detracted you from enjoying the storyapparently other people did enjoy it i considered going through and rewriting for the grammar mistakes however i am sure these same people would find something else to be negative about having said that i do not have any ill feelings towards the negative people or the skeptics this is the internet and my feelings arent hurt i love you people as much as the people who enjoyed the article 
i wish i could say this is my story but its not this one is courtesy one of my closest friends for reference ill be referring to him as bp slightly not safe for work i supposeid rather tag it and it not be than not tag it and have someones boss walk up and read it d also names and tiny details are changed or omitted but the overall story is legit a few years ago bp was dating this girl he really dug her and did everything he could to please her he was a reasonably funny dude not bad lookingand he sung for a band so he had his choice of a few ladies but chose this one because he was really fond of her bent over backwards for her so to speak after the relationship goes on for awhile he finds out shes been cheating on him and it didnt just start shes been cheating on him since they were courting apparently his love for her wasnt mutual and she just refused to give up other guys even after their own relationship seemed to get serious bp was furious but he wasnt the type to shit in her cereal beat up the other guys etc but he wanted to get back at her somehow some way a few days later were all out drinking hanging out hitting the bar circuit having a good time when who else but his exs mom actually shows up exs mom gets liquored up with us when bp actually saw his opportunity for revenge so he sweet talks the mother to the point where she ends up bringing him back home with her and thenyou guessed it he had sex with his exs mother but the story gets better postcoitus he decides to get up and go to the kitchen to get a drink not putting anything on but a tshirt he walks into the kitchen and opens the fridge at this point his ex who was out herself comes in and runs into him naked from the torso down in her fridge she screams at him what the fuck are you doing here nonchalantly he replies getting some orange juice tldr good friends long term girlfriend cheats on him gets revenge by sleeping with her mom gets caught in the kitchen by his ex and says getting some orange juice edit holy crap front page thanks guys edit somehow this made best of so this post made front page twice since today is my birthday i find it an amusing present in a weird sort of way however i do wish whoever posted it to bestof had clarified the title a little bit seems people think im delivering about the safe i dont know anything about the safe beyond what you guys know and i imagine if that op finally delivers itll stay on the front page for awhile
the year was and i was years into operating a landscape company i had done moderately well for myself being able to purchase a home pay off student loans and start a family i employed people during the what i call work season which for us is march through november december through february we lay off our workers and go on hiatus for the most part side note our company focused mainly on maintenance and in the pacific north west once all the leafs are picked up from the autumn there really isnt much maintenance to be done i had that year developed a relationship with a home builder who hired me to care for his personal home and very much liked our work he asked us to start bidding on installing the landscapes to the homes he built sounds easy right well remember we focused mainly on maintenance so my crew didnt have a ton of experience in the install detail of landscape and the homes this guy built were not track homes or your cookie cutter type neighbors you find in the suburbs no a small home for him was sq ft on a k sq ft lot and an average size he developed was to k sq ft home with all the bells and whistles he was more generous in his landscape budgets than many of the contractors id met and we were off to what i had hoped would be great partnership we finished the first projects he handed us and it was now the beginning of december when my maintenance side of things drops off this home builder came to me and asked if i would like to keep my maintenance crew working for the winter working for him i knew his next home project wasnt set to break ground till late january so i asked what he had in mind he told me that he and his son had been experimenting with spray foam insulation in their homes and had decided to invest into purchasing equipment to start there own company to purchase the equipment on this level was about k i said i would talk to the crew and get back to him the next week we signed a contract to work with him for three months at a specified pay rate for five of us he was confident he had enough work to keep us busy for the next three months first job was insulating this incredible house for this plastic surgeon who spared no expense for the gadgets and material that he put into his home next was government buildings on fort lewis next was new apartment complexes etc etc now this builder who i was friends with was not my day to day boss while insulating it was his son who is younger than i and a bit of a jerk but we got along fine and all seemed well the father owned the insulation company but had very little to do with it on a day to day basis hardly saw him for three months now being a contractor myself i was used to not getting paychecks every two weeks like most working folks i would get paid once a month from my maintenance accounts for the previous month of service and it didnt all come in at once sometimes people forget to pay on time my crew though was used to getting paid in a timely manner and after the first month of work and receiving no check from my new boss i inquired when to expect a check he assured me that once the checks started rolling in that we would see our money i totally get how that works especially for a new company trying to get off the ground so i paid my guys to keep the peace on my end and my boss and i worked out an agreement that i would keep track of everything paid and that he would cut me a check once he was able to i also had an outstanding landscape invoice out with the father of over k that i wasnt really worried about because he was not always super quick about payment not that i had to hound him about it but you understand now we are at the end of february of and it was time to gear up for the new season of landscape maintenance and put my crew back to work outside still no payment from insulation or last landscape project things got ugly real fast as i started daily phone calls to the son now that we didnt see each other as often i called the father who more or less ignored me the son stopped answering my callstexts etc the father never had a straight answer for me now mid april of most communication has stopped on their end i filed a contractors lien on the landscape project to be paid out before the house sold which prompted a call from the father to invite me to his home for lunch and talk i accepted thinking he was going to offer me a deal of some kind based on my past history with him he basically told me that he had been over the years screwed out of money by different people and that it was something that i was going to have to learn to live with my response ive been screwed out of money that people owe me as well just not by anyone i considered a friend i left his house determined to stick it to him may i started a spray foam insulation company with the same level of equipment that he had but about a year less experience than he had may th i get a call from the father asking a landscape question acting as if we were on normal terms my response was oh i dont landscape anymore i spray foam what are you talking about he asked when i explained to him that i was operating a spray foam insulation company he ended the phone call rather quickly i then receive a phone call from his son min later who had ignored my calls for the last many weeks threatening me that he would destroy my hopes of making it as an insulator and that no little landscaper couldwould make it in this community side note with my newly formed company there was now approximately companies in the pacific north west performing this kind of service it is a small circle of people in the insulation world and the word gets around pretty quick who does what etc our very first job was handed to us by our material supplier which happened to be his supplier and that job was a fix apparently that very first job we had worked on that plastic surgeons house was insulated incorrectly and poor workmanship luckily my only involvement on that house was prep work and clean up we ended up removing all of the insulation and reinstalling it about a k job which the owner of the house turned around and sued my old boss for and won we then acquired the government contract at fort lewis that he had because of poor communication on his part anyway we systematically took apart his company by being better and honest with people the story spread in the spray foam insulation world and we became somewhat hero like in this region because they had screwed so many people over oh and at that time if you might remember the housing market took a giant dump and guess who had very large houses sitting out there that couldnt sell yep the father who ended up going bankrupt by mid the son on the other hand kept his head above water somehow a bit longer but in oct of i got a call from a repo man asking if i new the son and where to find his spray foam equipment my father in law happen to be an retired cop and pi and i put him on the case to find said equipment two days later he called with the address and specific location of the equipment which was behind a barn on an island with the tires aired down i made the call to the repo man and two hours later he called me from his lot as he was pulling in with a very large trailer behind his truck asking where he could send the bounty check i kept the insulation business for about years before being bought out by another company i also kept the landscape company and still run it to this day moral to the story landscapers may work in the dirt and seem simple but piss one off and they will ruin you 
our lovely hoa has decided that should you choose to decorate your exterior for the winter holiday season your lighting may not have consecutive bulbs that are the same color unless all of your lights are the same color last year i hung my usual blue lighting and intentionally swapped in one red bulb just to piss off our hoa ccampr enforcement officer it took days before i had a friendly phone call another days until i received a certified letter and an additional days until a violation fine showed up the holidays passed and i continued to fight the fine i refused to pay it late fees started to build and eventually i was summoned to an association meeting i compiled a list of some of the most insane hoa regulations i could find to compare to the insanity i was dealing with i admitted that i changed the bulb intentionally and plead with the hoa board to have a little reason it turns out that while a majority vote was needed to pass a new regulation a unanimous vote is needed to change or repeal a regulation all of the hoa board members with the exception of one who just so happened to be the old woman who cited me for the violation to begin with agreed that the rule was unnecessary this old hag proceeded to argue that even though she didnt live on my street my lighting had ruined her christmas and presumably the christmas of everyone on my street finally someone on the board pointed out that while they needed a unanimous vote to change the regulation they only needed a majority vote to remove another member of the board an immediate vote was taken and the lighting nazi was removed from the board a motion was made to revote on my case and it was immediately dismissed 
i used to work as medic in the canadian oil patch good job for the most part as it pays more and is less stressful than ground ambulance i did a few years responding to calls then took some time off to live in new zealand when i came back to canada i was strapped for cash and looking to get back to work quickly so i took a job with the first company that called me back interview goes well i get a start date a daily wage rate and for the time couldnt be happier doing this job was apiece of cake basically it involves sitting in a truck with a mtc mobile treatment center stuffed in the box think pick up truck with camper mostly the reason medical staff is required has to do with ohs legislation if you are x amount of time from hospital and doing high risk work you need dedicated ems i spent days away from home at this remote work site where they were fracking gas wells and by the th day couldnt wait to get home i was excited to get my first real pay check in nearly a year and planning on first paying off some bills and then getting blackout drunk this is where shit went sideways on me i tore open the mail box like a child on christmas morning grabbing my check i headed down to the bank opening the letter i froze wtf im missing over a cursory glance at my attached paystub revealed i was getting paid per day less than i expected okay i think to myself must be a mistake im sure theyll rectify it for me the next day i went down to the office and met with asshat manager and a few other office people we sat down and talked it over and i asked if it was a mistake and when could i be expecting the rest of my pay am looked at me squarely and said you wont be getting that extra money i have discussed it with the rest of management and we have agreed no one told you that you would be getting day we only pay to start well im not saying you all told me i would start at you am told me i would get the day you hired me he always had this creepy little smirk on his face and i began to understand the underlying reason kinda looked like the pedo smile smirking at me he began why would i start you at the top wage wed have no where to go you wouldnt ever be able to get a raise and that wouldnt be fair now would it i replied that doesnt bother me besides you told me i would get with that smirk still plastered across his face he said i dont remember that did you get it in writing at this point i knew he got one over on me and while internally livid i tried not to betray any emotion no i guess i didnt am well there you go so lets get this settled while you are here youll get as a day rate and were all in agreement is that okay can you live on that i agreed without too much fanfare and left wordlessley cursing him and his progeny down the generations i start looking for jobs immediately as im not about to continue working for that asshole if i dont have to but remembering at the same time im not suited for unemployment days into my scheduled off i get a call from am hi astakask can you work tomorrow ive got a job and our medic is sick its really important theyre doing a large gas frac in the morning sure i says great youll have to come by tonight and grab a truck i wont be there so il give you the gate code to the yard and leave the keys in the gas cap you need to drive out to site tonight and be there for the am start you bet boss i said barely keeping my voice even at this point i decided to say fuck it unemployment isnt all that bad fast forward to am the next day the phone call i was expecting from am arrives where the fuck are you what do you mean you needed to be at the jobsite for am i just got a call from the oil company where the fuck are you im at home what you were going on this job we talked last night hmmm i dont remember this did you get it in writing i promptly hung up and then turned my phone off now they couldnt start that job and it was my companys fault if you know anything about fracking its hella expensive and they ended up having to pay for all the labor costs during the delay i got threats of legal action and such so i know it cost them thousands i hope it was worth it i dont burn my bridges i take off and nuke them from orbit its the only way to make sure its been almost years that company eventually folded and nothing ever came of their saber rattling i still get a good chuckle when i imagine that asshole going red in the face tldr company didnt pay me what i deserved and it ended costing them thousands more 
this happened a couple of years back ill try to keep it as short as i can with as much detail as i can i was married for years my wife was a wonderful person we had many laughs together and many great times as well she also happened to be full of shit between the years of she had multiple affairs including my daughters st grade teacher the security guard in the building where she worked the son of one of her friends this went on for years behind my back i had no clue she was a cheating bitch during the summer of i discovered the affairs i confronted her with it and she didnt deny it but instead of you know taking responsibility for it she told me she was running away to be with some dude she met on the internet i thought she was joking and didnt take it seriously the next morning she was gone neither me nor my daughter saw her for a year and a half it hurt her a lot because she really looked up to her mom finally i got sick of hoping she would come back and i filed for divorce on the grounds of abandonment she eventually came back and tried to act like nothing happened didnt matter because i got full custody she also tried to sue me for alimony but that failed miserably as well the revenge letting her fuck herself over she lost all of her friends is in a shit ton of debt and her parents hate her she works as a waitress at a restaurant and is living with random people off of cl but what i know hurts her the most is my daughter whos now wants absolutely nothing to do with her she got her visitation rights terminated by the courts so she cant see her either the most pro revenge anyone could take is letting someone fuck themselves over its priceless edit thank you whoever gave me the gold

in the music industry certainly the production side of things weve all done shitty gigs the sort of gig s that you know from the moment you get booked that its not going to be fun being female in this industry this sometimes works in my favour sometimes not so i get a call from a promoter who wants to put on a show locally and i got recommended to supply all the sound i run a small pa rental company i ask him the usual questions whats the load inout time whats the technical spec of the band whats your budget etc etc we agree a fee after minutes of telephone negotiating we are both happy with this fee it was gbp which is very reasonable for the personnel and equipment being provided the only thing i always insist on when im working for somebody i dont know have never worked with before is that i require cleared funds upon arrival at event location a phrase that i rattle off many times a year and i never have any issues me or my crew will bring k worth of gear to your event we will sometimes even start setting it up but as soon as possible you need to pay us so this promoter showed us where to load in to this theatreconcert hall type venue while my guys were walking around the venue checking the usual things like mains outlets pa flying points etc i took the promoter to one side and produced my printed invoice and said my usual spiel me i know you are real busy we need to start setting up so if you can sort payment now then i dont need to bother you again he did the whole looking guilty at his shoes routine promoter umm i dont have all of you money right now im waiting for my business partner he has your money he has it all can you wait for him to arrive me ok its not a problem what time is he due to arrive promoter around an hour or two before the doors open he has to set up the bar so he wont be later than this me look ive not worked with you but in the spirit of future business relations i will take payment in full anytime before the start of the show promoter thanks he has the money it wont be a problem me lol i know if i dont have the money before the start of the show then im not turning the pa on said jokingly but with a stern face so my guys setup everything we work efficiently for the next few hours the band arrive and we all get on well together they are friends of the promoter and dont seem as bothered about the money as we do i mentioned that this was the first show with this promoter and the drummer who was the informal leader of the band said the promoter has a different sound co every time they gig this gives me and the two crew guys cause to look at each other uneasily we finish soundcheck and as the band head to their dressing room we sit around stageleft watching the audience spilling in showtime is tminus hour i see the promoter hanging around stageright so i pop over to see him me hey promoter everything ok so far happy with everything promoter yes very happy everythings perfect band say soundcheck went well looking forward to the show me thats good lets get payment out the way and i can leave you alone to enjoy the show promoter errr listen ticketsales have been slow for this show can i pay you afterwards me i thought you had sold at a head minimum that makes at least you should have more than enough to pay im being kind but very firm im sorry but you need to sort out payment before the show weve trucked k worth of this gear here weve even set it all up and so far youve had all this for free sorry but i cant do the show without payment upfront once weve done a few shows together and weve built up a trust then i can help you out but this is our first show and i have rules sorry promoter ok let me see what i can do tminus mins to showtime my team is ready to go but we are anxious by now about the dodgy promoter the band are with us stageleft and ready to go onstage they know the situation they know weve not been paid yet but they dont seem that bothered they are friends with the promoter and seem to side with him im almost thinking about starting the show and getting the money afterwards but i stop myself dont break your rule i tell myself showtime tminus minute the promoter comes over to stage left and tells the band to go onstage he will intro them on my team are all in position behind the mixing desks etc ready to go on my say so i tug the promoters shirt by his elbow and look quizzical at him wheres payment i ask promoter yeah yeah smiling lets get the band onstage and i nip and get it for you while they are on me but as promoter walks onto stage woaahh i call after him almost shouting i am furious i know that it is impossible to kill the audio midshow and that riot may well break out if i did this much easier to not put myself in the position to start with i glance over at the front of house engineer who is looking at me for guidance i did the classic flat hand draw across the throat signal for kill it both my audio guys hit the global mutes on their desks and the promoter walks over to the centre of the stage and speaks into a microphone but nothing and i mean nothing comes out utter fucking silence the crowd boos they cheer then they boo again the promoter looks over at me angrily sidestage i gesture to him rubbing my fingers together in the other internationally recognised gesture of pay me my fucking money things are about to get heated so i grab a mic we have setup sidestage but out of sight of the audience we call them voice of god mics or emergency mics ladies and gentlemen sorry but due to a foreseeable hitch this show will be delayed by minutes cue audience chanting and lots of tension building up a lot of sweat dripping from the promoter instantly for fear of his reputation no word of a lie i had full payment in cash in my hand within minutes the show went ahead and i went on to do several other shows with this promoter he never tried to screw me again 
i was asked to submit this comment as a post about one of my college buddies pro revenge on his cheating girlfriend of years he found out that she was cheating on him and he was literally crying in his car for a few days he was planning on marriage and kids and the white picket fence with her he didnt tell her he knew he told her that he was going to his parents house for a few days to help them with some repairs instead he hung out with us and cried literally cried in front of his buddies for a couple of days we helped him get out of it he sobered up and told us how he was going to destroy her and i didnt even understand it at the time but he was headed to a famous law school and was thinking way ahead of us he drove to his girlfriends mothers house over an hour outside of town with her items from his apartment nicely boxed up and said he wanted to leave them with her for gf gfs mom and him had met several times he had gone to their thanksgiving etc gfs mom was like ok but why not suspecting anything was wrong and he said something brief like i dont think well be seeing each other again but i needed to get this box back to her but thank you for everything youve done for me im sorry it didnt work out gfs mom is stunned and tries to ask why and what and everything but my friend just starts crying i dont think intentionally and runs off and drives away he never broke up with the gf never even contacted her she heard about it from her mom who called her immediately and he received confused and angry texts from the nowex on his drive home a little while later at least a couple of weeks he gets an email from the gfs mom i dont remember the specifics but it was not i apologize for my daughter but more like i hope you find a woman who loves you unconditionally or something to that effect he responded with something like thanks your note means a lot to me nothing negative dude is now a upandcoming lawyer and still gets texts from the ex saying that she constantly hears from her mom how she ruined it with the one good guy she had and how she doesnt deserve to be happy friend has never responded to one text and blocked her from fb of course this was all planned my friend wanted the hurt to come from someone who would stay in his exs life not from someone who would be quickly forgotten he deliberately created a rift in the closest relationship that two women can have and all in a friendly second conversation with no harsh words or accusations edit my friend said he would join this thread a little later today
well this story starts out like quite a few others have i being in the us army become attracted to a woman whom i end up marrying at first shes all i could ever ask for in a woman sweet caring one hell of a cuddler doesnt really like video games like i do but makes an effort to get into them so we can spend time together doing something we both enjoy ampnbsp lets call her thundercunt or tc for short for reasons you will soon know ampnbsp i met tc through one of the other soldiers i worked with who we will call bb battle buddy since he was not at fault in this it was in the middle of the week and i had just gotten a work order finished up and was taking a quick break for a drink of water i heard bb asking a few other soldiers if they were open for a date for this coming weekend now i knew from a few other friends that bb was straight so i was curious as to why he was asking ampnbsp long story short bb had a female friend who was looking for a date for a movie that coming weekend i offered to go with his friend big mistake and she and i hit it off rather well and continued to see each other months pass it hasnt been enough time for me to consider marriage yet but she has some spontaneous ailments seizues and they were legit spring up out of nowhere since these only seemed to happen in her sleep and my command wouldnt let me stay offpost with her without being married ampnbsp lightbulb ampnbsp we got a courtroom wedding weeks later the added bonus not only could i stay with her while she slept to be ready in case of another episode but my tricare would fully cover her medical costs i was happy she was happy i got to tell my command now you cant stop me from staying with her and we all lived happily ever after ampnbsp except we didnt things went well for a while as i described at the beginning of the post but after a bit i started noticing things things like her needing to take her mother to the doctors office quite frequently her mother was sickly so i didnt think much of it at first or needing to head to the walmart town over because the one in our town didnt have what she needed in stock ampnbsp things like the car i bought and let her use seen parked in a lot next to several different trailer parks in a month ampnbsp well as luck would have it right as i started to get suspicious i came down on orders to pcs to korea so sidelining the investigation until i was able to continue i packed kissed my wife goodbye and let the army send me where they wanted me i spent a year in korea then came down on orders for texas i went there it was there that i found out exactly what was going on courtesy of her mom brother and her aunt and uncle ampnbsp this woman was sleeping with not even kidding in the slightest different men most of them soldiers her excuse to her family was frizzmaster is gay and doesnt want to come out so hes pointing out the men i can sleep with since he knows that theyre clean ampnbsp so basically this woman is using me as a paycheck and meal ticket and screwing everything with a pulse that happens to be male the icing on the cake is that weeks after i get the good news she calls me and confesses to cheating on meonce the only reason she confessed she was pregnant there was no way i could be the father given that i was in a different state at the timeand the father was african american ampnbsp i am very much not african american having been called neon white on more than one occasion due to my irish ancestry so there was no possible way this child would look like me at all so my wife felt the need to break the news to me before she had the baby because she could no longer hide it ampnbsp well things happened i went back home without her knowing and removed my belongings from the house i bought to keep her from selling them once she realized what i was about to do and started divorce proceedings ampnbsp this is revenge i saw her boyfriend not the babys father new guy entirely driving my car so i enlisted the help of her aunt and uncle to get my car back they pulled up behind him in a parking lot got out and talked to him normally at which time i waked up from the other side of the parking lot her uncle asked to see the keys and upon receiving them began taking the car key off of the ring and waved me forward ampnbsp i walked up took the car key from him looked at the guy and said hi my name is frizzmaster and this is my car im taking it now i waved him over to the sidewalk removed everything from the car that didnt have my name on it left the items with him then got in my car and drove off ampnbsp i found out later that day that he had packed everything and left her apparently he had been living in my house eating my food sleeping in my bed and wearing my clothes plus she had been using the money i sent her every month to pay for his court costs and child support costs ampnbsp well months went by our court date came up and my lawyer recommended that i file for sole use of the vehicle and the property since it was obvious that she had committed adultery and didnt have a leg to stand on we go to court she counterfiles for the exact same and since she refused to release the results of a paternity test i get stonewalled the exact words used by the judge were im sorry but without proof of paternity of the child i cannot in good conscience approve either of these motions ampnbsp so we set a new date for a private hearing with the judge and we wait nearly months go by and the court date was finally near i walked into the courthouse met up with my lawyer who had a demonic glint in his eye at the time and i was about to find out why went into the courtroom and waited minutes later she walked in shot me a dirty look which i did my best to ignore and sat down ampnbsp the judge came in minutes later the court was called to order and the divorce trial commenced here i found out just what had given my lawyer the twinkle in his eye earlier on he proceeded to ask tc a series of questions including ampnbsp is my client the father of your child ampnbsp when was the child conceived ampnbsp where was my client during the time at which your child was conceived ampnbsp do you know who the father of your child is ampnbsp have you received child support from the father of your child ampnbsp basically he questioned her into a legal corner in which she either had to answer truthfully or lie and suffer the legal ramifications of perjury in the face of easily provable evidence she answered truthfully lucky for her and the court case continued she presented her argument littered with dirt she was trying to throw on me insults to my person questions about my sexual orientation and claims that i was having a relationship with her year old cousin ampnbsp i falling back on my military training simply sat up straight folded my hands in front of me on the table and stared at a spot on the wall slightly above the judges left shoulder i answered every question asked of me offered no personal opinions threw no dirt and refused to sink to her level and question her sexuality subsequently she had a more and more confused look on her face as i refrained from badmouthing her like she was doing me and the divorce trial went by rather fast ampnbsp at the conclusion of the trial the judge looked over the paperwork submitted one last time then looked to the both of us are there any closing remarks or claims that need to be made tc made one last parting swipe about me currently living with her aunt and uncle i had rented my own apartment months ago after finishing my military time and going back home and i merely shook my head and resumed staring at the wall the judge took one last look over the papers set them down and spoke the greatest words i have ever heard in my life ampnbsp well looking over the evidence and testimonies presented there really is only one decision i can come to mr frizzmaster i am approving your motions for exclusive use of the vehicle and property upon undeniable evidence of adultery mrs frizzmaster the only one of your motions i am granting today is your request for a nocontact order and that is more for mr frizzmasters benefit than your own you seemed very combative and willing to cause him legal damage that he was not due and your repeated attempts to overtalk me while i was reviewing the paperwork did not speak well of you you no longer have a claim to either the property or the vehicle and will not contact mr frizzmaster unless it is to have him clarify which items do not belong to you ampnbsp tc had the audacity to work up a sniffle and ask the judge bbbut where do i go what do i do for a place to live ampnbsp the judge looked back at her and replied well mrs frizzmaster you have days to figure that out after which you will not set foot on that property again or else you will be held in contempt of court tldr horrible wife uses me for a meal ticket while she indulges in a very active social life and i respond by giving her a legal piledriver

i was walking home after staying at work really late walking through the bar scene i saw a cab and was so tired i decided to take it home the first time id ever decided to do so short aggressive ride where hes tailgating honking swearing and aggro as fuck despite it being a sleepy city fare i give him and ask for back cabbie gives me from a giant wad of money and says sorry he doesnt have any ones ok dude thinks im drunk because he picked me up outside of a bar and he thinks he deserves a better tip even though the ride was like minutes i say what do you mean you dont have any ones youre a cabbie and i just saw your giant wad of cash he persists i say no youre driving me down the street to that pizza shop and were getting change he says he wont when i ask he refuses to give me his name and then gives me a menacing get the fuck out of my cab looking like hes going to punch me in the face dudes definitely a tough guy and pretty scary think short stocky henchman type with buzzed silver hair and a leather jacket so i leave but not before catching his cab number as he speeds off ok its the principle of the matter this guys doing this to drunk kids all night and probably making a lot of money by intimidating and victimizing these customers of a public service fuck that i call the cab company and get my full back but it takes a bunch of harassment and several months to finally get it fuck that i call the cab companys director who couldnt care less and who flat out told me he believed the cabbies story over mine so not only is this shit happening but its being enabled and the complaints arent being registered fuck that especially i tell him that if he doesnt take any course of action whatsoever then id be forced to take it up with the citys transportation oversight commission that oversees all this stuff he basically dares me to do so ok so i enter into this ridiculously arduous process where after reading up on the local laws i write a major complaint to the public commission and request they be fined under certain articles a couple months later i get a response letter cab company hires this sleazy ass lawyer who claims im lying about everything and had all this malicious intent claims i demanded ones and the cabbie didnt immediately procure them but then did seconds later and at that point i was so fuming mad that i wanted to exact revenge calls my character and credibility into question completely the letter was so amateur and there were so many transparent lies in it that it was both laughable and sad so i go to my preliminary hearing which i took to mean was just like filling out paperwork or at most a private deposition or something nope everyones there including the cabbie the bedraggled secretary who sent my refund the cab companys director the sleazy lawyer a court reporter and a judge ridiculous cheap suits all around for the cab entourage the inperson sleaziness of the lawyer did not disappoint think bad pinstripe suit and pink tie slicked back hair and pencil moustache all resting on a sweaty and anxious fat man whose only apparent mode in trial is a combination of snideness and fauxsuspicion the cabbies giving me threatening looks during the whole thing and im frankly a little scared hes going to kick my ass afterward as a bonus the judge is relatively young extremely polite thoughtful levelheaded and patient we give our stories cabbie gives this reeeeally terribly acted story of how i intimidated him into getting more ones become furious etc but he cant even keep his facts together and keeps stumbling over his obviously rehearsed lines sleazy lawyer tries to poke holes in my very simple and coherent story like its a hardy boys novel it was dark you couldnt have seen the denominations of his money its the cheesiest fucking thing youve ever seen meanwhile im trying to cross examine him while basically learning on the job how to be a hack lawyer at a shitty municipal hearing and i even take a few jabs at the cabbie for lying on the stand that were met with various objections you could cut the tension between me and this cabbie with a knife and i made a lot of awkward mistakes because of that but overall it went pretty well a funny mistake i remember is that the lawyer made some objection and i butted in and said thats not even a good point and the judge cracked a smile in agreement and then told me me i could not be subjective during the hearing judge makes a ruling a few months later noting that the cabbie was clearly not credible and orders cab company to pay a civil penalty to the city for various infractions fraud not providing reasonable service and not identifying himself if i recall sweet i think but then months later lawyer issues an exception to this ruling which i didnt know could occur at around pm the night its due the exception brings up all these reasons that they shouldnt be fined eg there was precedent for this fine before and also attacks my credibility once again regarding details of the story basically threatening to undue the ruling if i didnt respond i get notice of this filing via email and frantically write up an official response to exceptions which was required to address these issues and i submit it just under midnight months later i think a total of years since the incident after several filings and correspondences judge examines the new material and rules that the fine stands got any ones now asshole tldr a cabbie wouldnt give me in change so i went out of my way to make his cab company pay in civil fines 
a couple years back i moved into this real exclusive apartment building in the miami beach area i had no clue at the time my landlord was a fascist dictator after she took my deposit and we moved in the problems started she had all sorts of crazy rules like shirts on for men at the pool no talking on cell phones in the hallway no overnight visitors and a whole list of shit she literally made up and applied whenever she wanted i knew she was fucked off in the head and we generally tolerated it until one day she decided kids were not allowed to play in the courtyard she started harassing my son on a regular basis telling him he was not allowed to play in the courtyard however i had an ace up my sleeve see i took a real estate course a few years back and i knew that discrimination against kids in any way shape or form was against federal law revenge time i told my son to ignore her and play as much as he wants as late as he wants granted he did his home work and his room was clean one day she had enough and snapped even going as far as to scream at all the kids in the courtyard she then knocked on every door who had a kid and informed them that playing in the courtyard by kids was not allowed when she came to me i simply asked her to hand it to me in writing she did needless to say i hired an attorney and won figure sum of which went to my sons trust in his name the owner of the building stood by her side the entire time and so rightfully the suit cost him the building he was forced to sell the building the new owner hired me as the building manager i was the resident manager for over two years pro revenge 
one of my ex girlfriends had a mother who was a high school teacher she was the sweetest thing although was also a total pushover for this storys sake well call her margaret jones when id visit my ex this woman almost wouldnt leave me alone constantly can i get you something to eat we had dinner earlier can i warm something up for you oh i remember you like this hot sauce so i picked some up for you and its in the cupboard here ill show you where so you can use it when you would like total sweetheart now i cant particularly vouch for how she was as a science teacher but i can only imagine she was probably overrun by shitty high school students who made her life hell she probably had a hard time controlling the class in many situations she just wasnt all that assertive one day my ex calls me holy fuck you have to see this facebook group and sends me the link its titled mrs jones is a cunt hahaha and has somewhere around members all high school students talking shit about this poor women how they make her life hell and what theyve done said to her etc of course my ex is deeply saddened because her mom is being slagged online at this same time my ex was completing her masters in university majoring in psychology her thesis was on bullying among teens how ironic my ex insists she contact facebook to get it taken down i told her no let me see what i can do first this caused a bit of a fight between her and i as im one for teaching people a lesson while she wanted to sweep it under the rug so her mom wouldnt find out and itd just go away further she didnt like eye for an eye mentality first i screenshot every conversation every comment every photo just in case it went away somehow i then wrote down every name made a nice little excel file with them all and began my quest seeing as i knew where all these kids lived well the general region i began to search out phone numbers or the kids who were stupid enough to link their parents on their fb accounts i found numbers or profiles for almost everyone in many cases multiples next up i compiled all the screen grabs into a nice little page webpage highlighting the worst comments peoples full names as listed on fb essentially nothing that wasnt already public information i just aggregated it together into a cute little package of course this included phone numbers as well links to the fb group and the comments were below every photo now the fun starts i begin calling the home phones of these kids one by one a typical conversation went as follows with little deviation hi is mr or mrs available hello hi there do you have a sondaughter named yes who is this well im a concerned internet user whos come across some very disturbing comments your child posted about their high school teacher oh what well if you go to ive put them all together with some links for you parent views page i uhh im so sorry well so youre aware im calling every parent with this same call when im done im submitting this to both the school board head office and the administration of the school im so sorry my child did this screams name of child get in here now thanks try and have a good evening i didnt get to find out the end details but her mother obviously ended up finding out about the group and the only info i got was that a good handful of the kids ended up getting suspended for between days depending on what they said that was great and all but im sure the wrath the parents laid out was far worse i smirked to myself throughout the entire thing knowing i was probably ruining these kids spring breaks as it was the week before tldr found a hate group on fb against my exs mom got a ton of kids suspended and told all their parents which was really the most satisfying part of it all

for a bit of background this happened a few years back smartphones we just starting to get cool and htc released the first android phone the g i got one for myself and one for my wife for our anniversary it was her first nonflipphone and she loved the keyboard we worked together at a clinical lab running peoples blood work and such this is actually how we came to know each other i called in sick one day and my wife went to work without me while i was crashed out on the couch feeling miserable i get a email from her phone i had installed a app that reports home with all kinds of useful information when the sim card gets switched out later when my wife got home she asked me if i had seen her phone thinking she had forgotten it at home when it was actually stolen from her purse at work a few days later i am over my illness and back at work knowing the phone was stolen most likely by a coworker i decided to play dumb and talk very openly about how forgetful my wife is saying things like this is the third phone she has lost i struck up a conversation with a girl that had been rumored to have sticky fingers other ladies at the lab suspected her of taking money from their purses but nothing could be proven if had gotten so bad they had to install lockers forum everyone so after a friendly conversation with her she offered to lend memy wife her old sidekick as she had recently gotten a new phone and wasnt using it i thanked her for her kindness and asked if we could talk more over text she gave me her number and i checked the email the lost phone had sent days previous of course the number associated with the sim card that was put into my wifes phone matched the suspected coworkers i continued to play dumb and let her kindly loan me the sidekick to replace my wifes lost phone she even offered to to sell it to me for cheap because we are friends i let it sit for a few days and when she began asking for money for the phone she had given me i laid it all out over text message i informed her that i had proof of her taking the phone and i would go to hr if she did not return it of course she denied the theft at first but agreed to all my demands and eventually admitted to having the phone which she would return on condition of my silence once my wifes phone was back in my possession i presented all the transcripts and relevant emails to the lady in hr that i was most acquainted with after getting my email summing up the events she asked me out to lunch so i could give her the whole story she was very excited to get to be a part of it well a few weeks went by and nothing then one morning actually more like noon as i work nd shift i wake to an interesting text how could you do this to me i got fired today because of you i though we had worked out a deal i smiled to myself got up and poured a cup of coffee then i replied dance with the devil and blocked her number 
this just happened i am flying out of seattle on an early morning flight there is a long line at the security check in area so long that it is overflowing out of the designated area the airport has provided a person with an end of the line sign to keep things from getting out of hand so i get in line and minutes go by there are about people behind me suddenly out of nowhere there is a new person in front of me now i am not sure about you but people who cut in line are second to serial killers for me but maybe he is just mistaken so i tap him and tell him that the end of the line is way back there this mofo turns around and says to me no the new line started right here what the fresh fuuuck the gall the brazen shamelessness made my teeth gnash and i can tell that other people in line agree with me but this is seattle so everyone just silently seeths meanwhile a tsa agent standing nearby witnessed this entire scene he comes over to me and asks did that man cut and i answered in the affirmative to this he replied people like that never actually get ahead little did i know his prediction would manifest itself soon thereafter as we head to the conveyor belt where bags are xrayed this troglodyte is still in front of me he puts his bags on the belt but they dont appear on the other end finally it dawns on him all his bags have been commandeered for hand check when the other passengers realize what happened there is audible celebration and jeering somewhere out there there is a tsa agent who is judge jury and executioner
years ago i was quite involved in an active online community of analog audio hobbyists people would occasionally put hardware and music up for sale on the message board we used id been looking for a specific piece of hardware for several years to no avail it was extremely rare and had never been sold in the us so any examples wouldve been imported from japan one of these machines popped up for sale from someone in the community and i jumped on it the guy offering it wasnt new but wasnt terribly active somehow hed obtained pics that werent on the net andor not easily searchable and ginned up a fake japanese bill of sale in hindsight he may have seen one for sale and stolen the images from that regardless it all seemed legitimate enough to induce me to go through with the transaction so paypal sent and he says itll ship in about a week then the excuses begin from hes been busy to out of town to his assistant shipped it but didnt send the tracking number to providing a fake tracking number then he just quit responding to calls or emails turns out the number hed given me was a forwarding service that he subsequently disconnected he also disappeared from the forum he had however used his real name and a real paypal account i filed a paypal claim and of course they denied the claim on some technicality im sure he was counting on this occurring this is where the revenge begins with an unintended bonus all i wanted was to make sure the guy knew id find him and get to him id called the police and reported matters but they couldnt have given less of a damn i decided to find him myself and found an old wedding announcement thatd been posted on the net i searched his wifes name and found mention of her being out on leave to give birth to their first child on her work website bingo i had a small gift sent to her workplace with my name on it and called her work to say that im an old friend and dont have their contact info but wanted to wish them congratulations on the new child and that id come see em soon i had visions of his wife saying how nice it is that someone sent a gift to her work etc and asking who i was this apparently spooked him because a cashiers check showed up for the full amount now what he hadnt counted on and i didnt tell him was that id filed a chargeback with american express after paypal denied the claim my conundrum was this the amex investigation was ongoing and i had no idea if theyd overturn the chargeback or not i also had no idea if the cashiers check was legit ive heard of counterfeit checks being returned up to days later so i truly didnt intend to profit off this but i did the amex chargeback was resolved in my favor which paypal clawed back from his account shortly after the check was proven good the kicker is the guy had the gall to email and threaten to try to have me charged with fraud for the chargeback when hed already sent the check i simply responded and said hey great to finally hear from you glad youre doing well hows the baby listen im sure theres just been a mixup and ill be happy to pay everything just as soon i get the machine im sure you understand why i want to receive it before i pay at this point of course if you do want to call the police youre welcome to explain to them how you attempted to defraud me by selling something you never possessed in the first place your call never heard another word i just hope his kid didnt have to go without diapers tldr scammer temporarily got one over on me i got that one back and ended up with a bonus

im a student at a local community college because the gen ed classes are much cheaper i had a heart transplant when i was younger but it was too late and now i suffer from chronic nerve pain that only gets worse the more active i am so i have a handicap parking pass one thing to note is that at this college with students theres roughly handicap spaces on an average day theres more unused faculty spaces than handicap spaces total fast forward to my third semester i had gotten into the habit of arriving to hours early to make sure i got a handicap spot because the next closest spaces are about feet away and you had to climb a hill to get to the main building id kill time by doing homework with my friends or playing dampd first day of the semester i park and as im getting my laptop out of my car i notice that another car had pulled up behind mine the driverolder woman hereby refered to as eb short for english bitch asked if i was parking there i of course answered yes i have a placard she scoffs and says out loud whos is it your grandmothers and drives away at the time i didnt think too much of it im young and dont have a wooden leg or anything so its happened before the next day i arrive like i always do and notice that all the handicap spots are full and that the same car from yesterday is parked there this time i recognize the woman in it shes an english professor one of my friends has her for th century literature i find this odd because the faculty spots are really close by eb sees me and smirks whatever i suck it up and park that day me and my friends are playing dampd in a room we found eb walks by and sees me and my friends and tells us that were not allowed to be there and we need to leave this second now im really pissed shes only doing this to be a bitch we werent hurting anyone and her class next door doesnt even start for almost an hour but she still sits in that room and reads a novel she does the same thing every chance she gets for weeks so ive been thinking of a way to solve this problem for most of the semester talking to the english department headmy literature of science fiction teacher i find out that she doesnt even have a placard the one she hung from her mirror is her grown sons now i know what to do heres what i did reserved the room she had her class in until minutes before her class for dungeons and dragons club with a sign and everything then i alerted campus police that several people were using other people handicap tags for those unaware you get paperwork when you get one validating that its yours in my state using one thats not yours is a towable offence and a automatic fine so campus police start asking for peoples paperwork that day starts like most others that semester get there shes in a handicap spot i go to play dungeons and dragons but when she comes to kick us out of her room but she cant because ive reserved it after i inform her of this she storms off mumbling about seeing the dean she comes back for her class but by that time im on my way out after my class i go out to the lot and notice that her car is missing next day i arrive and ebs car isnt in one of the spots it was towed best feeling of my life that day my friend tells me later that she arrived to class minutes late that day and covered in sweat she biked there for the rest of the semester never had a problem with her for the rest of that semester
my mom has been a nurse for almost a decade now of those years she worked at the same hospital on one of the most busy floors to work on until she finally had enough of the pisspoor management before she left though she exacted an amazing feat of revenge that got the hospital into a lot of trouble as i said mom worked on what was probably the busiest floor in the whole hospital this particular floor is severely understaffed and many times there were only three or four nurses working each one having to care for or patients each sometimes even more lots of times it would be pretty much impossible to get everything done in a hour shift when you have to pass meds tend to and chart for that many patients my mom is a great nurse she is extremely smart a hard worker and she really does love her job usually she would be the first nurse to get done with all of her work and then help other nurses with their workload so everyone could leave on time her coworkers there loved her like no ones business this kind of work ethic landed her a position as a charge nurse as a charge nurse it was her job to see to it that all or most of the paperwork is done properly and faxed that nurses were getting their charts in on time and passing meds when need be it was her job to interact with the doctors and fill orders and direct in case of an emergency now at this particular hospital there are a lot of residents who are fresh from medschool and have very little experience in a real hospital setting sometimes they would give orders that were unnecessary or not the best solution for the health of a patient mom being so respected would often times coax the doctors into changing their orders to something more suitable as she has a lot of real workexperience but then some doctors would disagree and tell the nurses to go on ahead with his instruction then when something goes wrong the blame would go on mom and there was really nothing she could do about it she finally had enough when a doctor ordered a heart catheter on a patient who was extremely drunk and in no state of mind to make decisions for himself my mom tried everything to get the doctor to not go through with it because the man really didnt need to have a heart catheter at all this doctor was all the time ordering ridiculous treatments for patients because that is how he makes his money he convinces this drunk man to sign the surgery papers and sends him to or where he was basically receiving an unauthorized surgery seeing as his decision making was impaired after that my mom decided to start applying for jobs at other hospitals because she couldnt stand to see any more patients being abused and mistreated by the place that is supposed to have their health in best interest when she finally landed another rn position she gave her notice and worked to the end of her term after she recieved her last check they tried to tell her she was overpaid and she would have to pay back some of the money obviously she didnt and was appalled at the way they were treating her after years of loyalty to this hospital so she started plotting her revenge before quitting she contacted jcaho joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and told them about the unauthorized surgery this is a big nono it is something that can make a hospital lose their accreditation and be closed down permanently she gave them the name of the patient the file number the case number the name of the doctor and the name of all other parties involved in the surgery she was very thorough the day after she quit a close friend of hers that worked the same floor said that a jcaho rep came and did some investigating almost entirely unannounced they do warn the hospital before they come but never give them enough of a notice to change anything beforehand about a week after their initial investigation one or two people had gone and interviewed staff and look at medical records they came back again this time they came with a lot of people they pulled every single file to review and see if any other sketchy practices had been preformed under the radar for every breach of hipaa and osha protocol they were fined thousands of dollars the doctor and all staff involved in the cardiac catheter incident were fired and the doctor lost his license and can never get it back they threatened to close the hospital if the fines werent paid which added up to hundreds of thousands of dollars of course the family of the man found out about the surgery and sued the hospital spoiler he won and had to pay him off too to this day jcaho visits the hospital frequently to make sure no more unethical practices happen again dont treat your nurses like shit and dont treat your patients like shit or it will come back and bite you in the ass edit word cleanup

back when i was in college i used to wait tables to pay the bills i worked at a highend restaurant in the downtown area serving both lunch and dinner but dinner service was where the bulk of my income came from because most of the hostesses for were in high school the managers asked servers to volunteer to host for lunch service which i volunteered to do one day a week the shift was always shown on our server schedule one day i came home in the afternoon and had messages on my answering machine from my frantic year old manager asking where i was and saying i was scheduled to hostess i was surprised because i swore i wasnt scheduled and since it was after lunch service i went in for my dinner shift as scheduled when i got there i confirmed i didnt have a shift marked on the regular schedule but someone pointed out since it was summer and high school was out the manager created a separate schedule for hostesses and i was scheduled there i talked to a manager and explained what happened but they sent me home from working my dinner shift anyhow angry that i was punished something i didnt feel was my fault and because i was actually volunteering to help out i took a note to the office the next day saying that since i was not hired to work as a hostess and it was now affecting my income as a server i did not agree to work anymore hostess shifts well turned out they had me scheduled on a second hostess shift that week which again i did not know about and didnt show up for sure enough they fired me and it was only a couple weeks before i was about to leave on a long summer trip overseas since i had heard from people in town that the tip out policy for the restaurant requiring us to tip of our tips to the kitchen staff was illegal i did some research found out it was and made a trip to the labor board with a copy of an employee hand book and filed a complaint took them awhile to go in and investigate but about a year later i got a check for k they had to reimburse me for those tipouts and found out it cost them a total of over k to reimburse all the restaurants employees they have to go back years from the time they go in and investigate and paid a ton of fines the bonus on top of it all was it turned out they had underage migrants washing dishes when the investigators went in so they got hit with additional violations for that tl dr wrongfully fired so i filed a complaint with the labor board over violations that cost the owner over half a million dollars edit since a few people have asked about what state this occurred in etc i found the following fact from the us department of labor therefore it appears this is applicable in all states gt tip pool the requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips such as waiters waitresses bellhops counter personnel who serve customers bussers and service bartenders a valid tip pool may not include employees who do not customarily and regularly received tips such as dishwashers cooks chefs and janitors 
throwaway because i dont know if i could get in trouble for posting this or not so the other day my strict manager was in a particularly good mood and told us this story and i thought it belonged here a week or two ago it was dinner time on a friday so like plenty of other restaurants we were really busy with a long wait a former employee from a different location comes in to apply for a job because of how busy we are the manager asks the cashier for basic information and her resume so he can look her up in our system he finds out that she cant be rehired per company policy so he has the cashier tell her that the restaurant is too busy for a manager to interview her despite not getting an interview the girl and her friend decide to eat dinner and not pay my manager looks over the tapes and sees the girl applying for the job walk around through the store section of our restaurant go to the bathroom and leave a few minutes later her friend does the same thing luckily he has all of her personal information on the resume she left as well as information on her car from security cameras what does my manager do he calls her back up and apologizes for being so busy maybe she could come back in for an interview with him she wants to know when so my boss lies and says that hes leaving on vacation for a few weeks and it would be best if she came back in as soon as possible an hour later he sees her car pull into the parking lot and calls the police he sits down with her and conducts an interview like any other he excuses himself to go get some availability paperwork and comes back with the receipts and confronts her about not paying she immediately starts freaking out saying her friend told her she would pay for her meal and talking about how her friend was always stealing from her and she shouldnt trust her friend anymore she offers to pay for her meal but says she wont pay for her friends my manager tells her that shell pay for both or hell bring in the police that hes already called she pays for both meals and leaves a nice tip then she asked my manager wait you didnt just bring me in here to have me pay did you my manager tells her of course not but that she should come in tomorrow and ask for theresa our general manager so she can interview her sure enough she comes in the next day and asks for our gm theresa tells her that not only will she never work at one of our restaurants again but she is not welcomed back at our location a lot to go through for a dine and dash but still amusing if you ask me
i stumbled over this subreddit and immediately knew that i had a story to tell that fits perfectly in here ampnbsp this was about a year ago i had just moved into my new flat because the previous one was quite uncomfortable as the owner and other flatmates were generally dicks lots of clashes with them and lots of leassons learned on how not to deal with people your usual college experience stuff you know ampnbsp now i had a job and money time to live on my own ampnbsp i move in and all is fine for a month but i am exposed to loud gaming noises im a gamer myself so naturally i am not too annoyed about this but these game noises would normally not stop until amam which is kinda shitty for my sleepcycle and the enjoyment of weekends trying to do the civil thing i ask the neighbour to turn it down turns out my neighbour is from new zealand and doesnt speak german hint this is all taking place in germany my english is good enough to have some chitchat and i try to build a friendly bond by idenitfying that he is either aussie or nz hes amazed by my english and confirms to be a kiwi he concludes with saying that it is no problem to game quietly says he can do that definitely ampnbsp however no noticeable change in volume rinse and repeat the same over the following week with very short convos about the noise and nothing else i get a bit more annoyed on a thursday at explaining that i have a job in the morning and id like to be on time and well rested etc to that i simply get a fuck off youve been annoying me already enough suck it up like a man and he closes the door further attempts from me to just figure out wtf just happened by ringing the doorbell and knocking are ignored his dog goes apeshit at the same time ampnbsp i am short tempered ampnbsp fuck this guy i take some ducttape and tape his doorbell button so it constantly rings gotta be efficient about this its germany its the law to be efficient also gotta be smart about this i pull my fuses for the entrance hall that supply the light and doorbell all in preparation of that piece of tape clinging to my doorbell ampnbsp i try to go to sleep deducing that the idiot is trying to ignore the doorbell for a good minutes before i hear it stop i guess he figured out it was just a tape the next morning i see the tape on my doorbell cant get me with my own weapons sucker ampnbsp fast fwd two days gaming noises at same annoying volume i am pissed off and knock on his door no answer by now the neighbour on the other side has come to the hallway and asks what is going on i tell him about the noise issues and he just confirms that its quite normal for that guy but he cant do anything permanent about it but he offers to call the cops as he has done that before many times ampnbsp i go back inside and notice the gaming volume has massively increased what a spiteful sucker i can also make out that hes gaming on xbox from the notification sounds that pop up every now and then knowning that i have a potential ally calling the cops who is already openly in hostility with this guy i wait for the cops to arrive and find his extremely loud gaming ampnbsp coppers basically tell both of them to respect the rules of being quiet after and to not be dicks about it i fight the urge to enter the hallway and openly reveal myself to the asshat neighbour as being involved with the cop call a lesson i learned from previous flatsharing fuck em without implicating yourself as the origin of the trouble it makes you less of a target and hides that you have a motive for possibly greyarea stuff i heed this advice very closely ampnbsp and that wouldve been the end of it if my beloved fucktard neighbour had stuck to the coppers advice basically the second the coppers left in their car i am back to experiencing him losing at whatever shitty game he plays ampnbsp i immeditately complain to my flat owner via phone about how to solve this and that i am super unhappy with the noise and i ask what can be done about it my landlord tells me that the flat next door is not owned by her but by someone else named fritz name obviously changed for this story and that therefore she cannot do much about it other than complaining to them after some digging by checking door labels and postboxes and basement storages i find out that the collosal dickbag neighbour is living with the daughter of the flat owner lady fritz ampnbsp shit ampnbsp i know that the landlordkicksteneantout angle is now impossible or very unlikely however i have never seen that girl walk in or out of his apartment or seen her any other way also he plays loud console games until am id like to meet a woman that would live with me and let me do that i doubt they exist from this i assume the girl isnt even living with him or not anymore or something shady is going on ampnbsp i had many nights awake that i could have called the cops filed complains tried to get restraining orders and whatnot but i literally have no time or knowledge about this stuff and i asked my landlord to pursue the legal route for me which was not really yielding anything i doubt she did anything ampnbsp meanwhile i spent the occasional sleepless night planning and plotting this guy will go down ampnbsp i take the latest housemail informing us about chimney cleaning and lift maintainance and create a lookalike i work with photoshop and indesgin a lot so this was easy purposefully and to stay on the legal side of this i replicate a lookalike logo different header and footer but same font and fontsize for the body ampnbsp half an our later a super nice letter is made detailling how this building we are living in has decided collectively that garbage separation is a scam and therefore no longer a thing that applies to us in germany afaik by law a requirement to save the environment so all your organic waste cannot go into the same bin as your plastic or paper shit goes we separate plastics organics and paper heck even bottles into white brown and green glass ampnbsp queue evil grin ampnbsp i put this notice folded correctly in the retarded way our building association folds their stuff and put it into his mailbox ampnbsp he always keeps his trashbags in front of the door on the hallway until he feels like carrying them down to the trashbins two or three days laters which annoyed me as well it used to be two bags the classic yellow bag which we use for plastic trash and a regular bag for food waste and similar stuff ampnbsp now it is just the yellow bag with all shit in it i have my confirmation that dickbag is an idiot who cant tell legit from fake plus hes in for a fine and citation from the garbage service as they literally dont take his yellow bags if they can see stuff that doesnt belong in there the yellow bags are translucent google gelber sack ampnbsp the citation is just a nice side effect i have my knowledge now that this guy is not mentally alert enough to properly factcheck stuff a very bad habit but very important to know ampnbsp got him fined ampnbsp by now in mid summer this guy is smoking a lotand gaming less and if i have my windows open all his shit smoke enters my flat and upsets me even more boy this guy is trying hard to annoy me as soon as i try to communicate with him all i get is rude curses and insults in his accent that i find kinda hilarious definitely not a pretty reply to hi there i close this windowtowindow conversation by thinking to myself ok enjoy your cancer i think since then he trys to smoke more often out the window just to piss me off ampnbsp fine by me i fire up indesign and set up a new letterhead and logo this time from a well known tobacco company i write up a letter directly addressed at him contents are some copy pasted marketing bs from their website which then i conclude with a statement of how the company knows that he is a person making good descisions and knows what is good to thank him for this the company has included two cigars as complimentory gift i fix it up in an envelope and use my companys vaccumpackagesealer thingy to make it into these typical giftletterthingers i slap an address onto it send it through proper mail for that extra bit of authentic mail stamp and handling cost me probably all in all ampnbsp yes i am trying to incept this guy yes i am literally trying to give this guy cancer i have a short temper ampnbsp i admit it wasnt too successful i hoped hed switch over to smoking cigars but i couldnt lace the cigars with crack or some other drug to make him addicted but still i know that he was buying cigars every now and then and smoking them ampnbsp as for me i simply closed my window and that was the end of the problem for me ampnbsp accelerated his cancer ampnbsp back to tackling the flatowner problem oh boy the internet is lovely i know quite a lot of detail about this guy and his girl thanks to linked in instagram and facebook that shit should be illegal seeing how easy it is find out stuff about people its scary i locked my stuff away super quick after this finding out someones email via linkedin iswas also dangerously easy ampnbsp now i find out how this guy can live there and play until am the girlfriend is not living in germany but studying in denmark i assume they visit each other occasionally or its really just a housesitting arrangement but fb tells me they are an item so i rule out the housesitter theory and alogn with that any hope that this problem will resolve itself once she comes back ampnbsp my landlord has given me the phone number of the fritz flat owner who i should call if the problem gets out of hand i did that few times and it worked barely two times ampnbsp bless skype sms service i quickly make a new skype account get for skype credit and i get ready to text that lady from an anonaccount i dont trust the freesms websites i send that poor old lady a text in german saying that i suspect asshat guy is having an affair with someone but that i am unable to reach said daughter directly singed with generic german girls name ampnbsp the back and forth annoying continues for a while until the end of september when the daughter returns to live in the apartment lo and behold the gaming at am stopped i am almost happy had i not set my sights to destroying this asshat idiot i cant just leave stuff unfinished ampnbsp that skype acc with credit comes in handy again i start calling the number that this loud flat had provided in the general neighbour contacts sheet the one number was a landline number the other was a mobile number so i had a chance of getting the guy or the girl when i call either line at first worried about this i decided that was actually favourable ampnbsp so i start calling their landline seriously who the eff has a landline anymore at random times of day one or twice a week always when i know the fritz daughter is home when she picks up and says her name i just hang up super quick right after that i call the mobile number which to my luck turned out was the guys mobile number he picks up and i give him with distorted voice and heavy german accent that i assume was good enough to conceal me some random trash talk about cigars pretending i was a sales rep from the tobacco company i keep the convo short and try to ask questions that have him say answers like yes sure and dont worry then i try to go for the kicker i ask him if he would like to be invited for a tobacco trade festival the next weekend it would be out about h of drive of town beginning on a saturday at pm and running for the entire sunday ampnbsp i was trying to get him to yell out loud next weekend sure or ill be there but he didnt i spun along some crap details to give him more security and a sense of legitimacy of this he reassured me he would be there i asked if xyz was the name that should be on his reservation for one sadly due to high popularity he couldnt bring a spouse its ok she doesnt smoke anyway after saying thanks we hang up ampnbsp i wish i couldve been a mouse in the wall listenting to what fritzdaughter was asking and saying ampnbsp now here i lose my firm grip of the situation a bit as i couldnt get exact confirmation that he actually left on saturday midday for the distant city but it wouldnt matter really he just needed to come back super late or the next day with an excuse that the entire thing didnt exist and was fabricated which i hope the fritzdaughter figured out as well ampnbsp i bought some new boxers and wrote in my best girlyhandwriting a note you forgot that asshole also why are you still living with that bitch its over i put both the boxers and the note into their mailbox and hoped that fritzdaughter would be the one opening it now there is a problem the post doesnt deliver on saturdays or sundays here in germany so i had to get her to check her postbox ampnbsp i walked over to the fritzflat and rang the bell fritzdaughter opened and i ask her whether she had also gotten the letter about some excuse for misinformation about garbage separation some months ago and that there is a way to claim damages because of fines that occured due to misinformation i couldnt quite figure out who to call about this and was wondering if she had already done this mentioning that i was relieved that this letter was handed to me today in person she told me she didnt receive one ah possibly they will mail it to you then and i said goodbye and left ampnbsp i went into my flat and waited for the fruit of my subversive labour to be ready i didnt confirm that she checked the postbox but i know she did sometime because the asshat guy came back at around how do i know the walls a thin and a pissed of girlfriend can be super loud and very expressive in her language i couldnt make out too many details but id like to think that my plan worked out perfectly well as she kicked him out right there and then which again could be heard very loudly from the hallway ampnbsp got him kicked out got his gf to dump him ampnbsp he left with his dog which is a shame as it was als my goal to make him lose ownership of the dog as well but i guess i cant be too cruel if i wasnt already seeing someone else id probably wouldve started courting fritzdaughter as a cherry on top but ehh ampnbsp tldr neighbour is superfuckinloud make him get fined make his gf dump him get him kicked out and sped up his cancer gg ampnbspampnbsp edit reddit formatting it is hard this is as good as it gets edit thanks for reddit gold o i dont know what do with this does anyone want it
my grandmother got married in to a young man in the military for a wedding present their parents bought them a house in a nice suburb white picket fence whole yards not long after they moved in the next door neighbor planted a mullberry tree on the side of his property near my grandparents driveway nothing seemed amiss but if you know mullberry trees you know that shit is about to get real about years later the mullberry tree was obnoxious the birds would come and eat the berries and any car parked in the driveway would get shit on and it would stain the cars and ruin paint jobs my grandmother upon realizing the culprit baked a nice apple pie walked next door and asked the neighbor if hed mind trimming back the branches of the tree that hung over her driveway he told her not to worry hed get to it soon three days later my grandmother opened her door to find a halfeaten pie in the plate crawling with ants and a note that said i changed my mind my grandmother threw out the pie cursing up a storm and swearing up and down shed get him to trim that tree or get him back city ordinance said she could not trim the tree as the roots were on his property so the whole tree was his property as the years went by my grandmother repeatedly asked him ever so nicely to trim it back his responses were always along the lines of no and fuck off finally in the mids my grandmother retired and received a large bonus from her employer for her years of work she took the money and bought the empty lot on the other side of the neighbor then went to a nursery and bought mullberry trees planting them along her property line on both sides of his property about years ago he became angry at the damage they were doing to his cars and cut them all back without permission my grandmother took him to court and he was forced to reimburse her for the trees at a markup because theyd had years to grow

i am a season ticket holder for my local mlb team currently in my second year but this happened last year one lazy saturday afternoon i was planning to use the tickets i had for the day i have my friend had to bail last second so since im not that far away from the park i decided to just go ahead and go by myself it was too beautiful a day not to after getting a beer and some nachos i head down to my section i see the majority of the row is filled including my seats this is definitely not the first time this has happened and usually if its kids i just sit somewhere else near by and enjoy the game anyway last year the team wasnt doing very well and there more than a few open seats so i end up sitting in the same row about seats away well about minutes later the rest of the group came back from wherever they were and i was sitting in their seats one of them says hey can you move we were sitting here before i could respond or even just politely move their friends who were sitting in my seats chime in and say yeah we dont who that is hes just been sitting there like a creep since you guys left i get up and say to the kid who asked me to move oh im sorry and walk over to the one who called me a creep and said get out of my seat i showed him the ticket and with little protest he moved to the end then i looked at his friend and said you too these are both mine for two innings we sat their awkwardly best part was when i ordered a hot dog and another beer so they would have to pass it down to me eventually they moved but i felt pretty good about how i handled the situation 
this is not my story it belongs urocknocker he posted it in an ask reddit thread was working as an expat oil company senior staff geologist and de facto exploration manager but without the increase in pay nor authority just increased stress levels in the middle east for a southern european construction companys oil and gas concerns the general manager was a complete cuntwat full of himself because he worked for one major oil company his whole benighted career as an engineer so obviously he knows everything about geology geophysics petrophysics etc he didnt and doesnt his management style if one could grace his screaming and infantile fuming as a style could be described variously as inept micromanagement or management by objection would berate and degrade the entire staff in meetings with partners which made everyone terribly uncomfortable to see such a lack of decorum and professionality scream so the whole office could hear over mundane idiocies such as lack of coffee pods in the kitchen or why meters of pipe had never materialized even though the unpaid invoice still nestled on his desk in a multicultural office he would rant and rail at top volume about useless fucking arabs fucking selfimportant and entitled expats and goddamn fucking jinglebunnies those engineers and others from the subcontinent region called the firm the worst fucking oil company in the middle east at least here we agreed not only a racist but a sexist misogynist general misanthrope and a complete and total waste of carbon he got in my goodie locker one day after a well was drilled but yet to be tested or completed based on my prospect and recommendation looked somewhat dismal on the logs truth is the well came in for over bopd and it was the jakeleg and lowestbid from whom he always took kickbacks loggers that had fucked over the logs and he absolutely refused my insistence to relog the pay zones i was called just about every nasty name in the oil patch handbook right down to the part where he told me my alma mater were a bunch of fucking idiots for granting me my three petroleum geology degrees after years in the patch i decided that no job was worth this and laid plans for a quick early and entirely unannounced departure i quietly related the fact that i was doing a runner to some of my other expat compatriots over drinks one thursday evening and was greeted with the revelation that several read most of the other expats there were thinking the same thing and if i left they were gone as well we carefully laid our plans the company provided housing ie paid a ridiculously low monthly fee so we had to live in cheapass housing or sucked it up with our families and ponied up additional funds to live in decent villas so we all gave clandestine notice to our respective landlords about our imminent departure and asked they keep it on the qt since they were paid by check per year and were already compensated they were both delighted that they had already been paid once and that they could rent out our abodes after we left for essentially double rent cancellation of internet water and power were token a quick email print the automated response and carry it with you if the border guards gave us any shit when we buggered off since we were all western european canadian or american we decided to book a block of business class tickets as was our contractual due to london on the same british airways flight in fact with families and all we booked the entire business class section we all had been incountry for years and years so arranging packing and shipping or storage of our belongings was a snap we were all members of the move every months to follow the money crowd so this was the easiest part of our master plan no one leaked a word of all this but some of the locals in the company somehow sensed the change in the decorum of the companys daily activities when one really doesnt give a shit the stress levels magically evaporate down to near zero and wondered aloud what was going on we confided in a few of them these were not just colleagues but personal friends in many cases with the proviso that they would tell no one under the pain of bacon sandwiches they were all muslims and they thought the threat hilarious like i said many were and are still close personal friends the weeks dragged on and school was about to let out for the summer when most expats bugger off for months to escape the stupidly hot and humid middle eastern broiler season so the usual requests for contractual time off were made and all roundly rejected by herr mr dickhead general manager and life proceeded on its merry way finally liberation friday arrived weekends being fridaysaturday at this time in this country we contracted a local carrier and had a bus rented to pick up everyone and take us all to the airport luggage tagged and schlepped off to the bowels of bas incomprehensible baggagehandling inner workings through checkin customs and passport control without so much as a sideways glance we all invaded the english pub after hitting duty free one last time we toasted each other on a job well done and best soon forgotten sitting in business class waiting on takeoff quaffing my third double vodka and bitter lemon i did a quick tally the company was in this one instance losing its sr staff geologist cum exploration manager senior geophysicist sr petrophysicist sr geomodeller sr reservoir engineer drilling engineer operations geologist logistics manager senior surveyor secretaries wives of the aforementioned senior crowd and the hseq manager a small company total or so total employees could withstand the loss of or maybe even of their senior level employees but not this mass emigration my good friends whom we left behind regaled us for months regarding the situation in the office come sundaybloody sunday once the realization of what had happened the gm went completely off the rails totally shithoused and completely berserk or variations on that theme the first glimmer of recognition of the severity of the of rotund bale if jeers about to descend upon him were when all calls to various abodes were answered with that number is no longer in service please check blahblahblah emails went unanswered however our gsms were still working although we all blocked herr dickheads number though we still allowed text messages text where are you why arent you at work was just the beginning in the words of khan noonian singh we let him eat static text where the fuck are you if you dont get you asses in here immediately and other such impotent threats yes please id love another drink rising panic ensued text this isnt funny come in and well act like this never happened we all sat on the plane anticipating touchdown by the time we hit london it was local time but backthere time herr dickhead gm called an emergency meeting of the remnants of his staff all locals and demanded to know what they knew about this huge display of insubordination dunno never heard a word why what happened and where is everybody were the responses herr dickhead blows a gasket and immediately sacks everyone left in the office unfortunately all that were left were a couple of teaboys who are always in demand and a bunch of locals due to the countrys ization plan it would be easier to fly a fully loaded through the hole of a bagel than it would be to dispose of a local indigenous worker long story short he couldnt and was instantly reported to the proper ministry in charge of such matters as one of the secretaries was kin to the minister of employment affairs its all wasta nepotism in this part of the worlds final damages loss of senior employees fines of over riyalsday due to improper business practices firing locals loss of drilling rigs due to lack of personnel and inability to provide work as per contracts and cessation of drilling of active wells into the hole so to speak about usmm each and or field development wells so long cash flow loss of a d seismic contract worth approximately usmm adios exploration program loss of arating meaning you take a back seat to all who try and tender rigs seismic crews etc good luck sourcing oil country tubular goods logging or completion services and pretty much all field related activities loss of face with several ministries no small item here huge importance is placed on competence and perceived amiability au revoir field development plan acceptance or seismic contract approval loss of locals to the national oil company figured if expats deserted this amalgamation of idiocy masquerading as an oil company they should bail as well ultimate temporary closure of the office cessation of all field activities payments of on defaulted loans and contracts and loss of several lucrative pipeline rightofways and transfer contracts they had to continue to pay the still employed locals basically sending them a check for sitting at home playing xbox and loss of of their acreage due to nonfulfillment of contracts with the government last i heard herr gm dickhead is thrashing around south texas trying sell some sort of jumpedup and shady oil deals with companies who have seen their own projects quashed by plummeting oil prices funny thing is he keeps running into people now on the other side of the desk who both know him and in one or two cases actually worked for him one receives a special goldplated schadenfreude when you lean ever so slightly forward and tell him to fuck off and dont let the door hit you in the ass on the way out you might suffer brain damage tldr general manager at an oil company treats all his staff like shit so we work together to cost the company millions of dollars and cost the gm his job
i know a lot of people have been waiting for this update this shit gets better if you havent read the original post check it out to clear up a misconception from last time i did call the police at the time of the incident and they would not come out because it was on private property when i left you guys last time the police were about to serve this dude the paperwork i had found him and i was awaiting a phone call from the sheriffs department with a confirmation but their phone call wasnt the best news they arrived at the defendants business address and no one was at the address the deputy told me he could try again tomorrow but i was already not a fan of the way the police had acted until this point so i told him to leave the paperwork at the police station and ill take care of it myself i enlisted a coworker david to serve this guy instead i drove david to the place of business a two story decrepit business complex with grey stonework and s style brown trimming the defendants place of business was on the second story in a dark corner amidst other small businesses it was extremely quiet and not one of the offices upstairs were occupied david knocked on the door with no answer however there was a mail slot in the middle of the door we looked through it and saw that the office was about the size of a mini cooper with a solitary desk and a dell pc nothing was on and there was no phone we called the phone number i had tried earlier and no one answered so we went downstairs hoping to speak to another business owner as to the whereabouts of this guy for some reason the empty office gave me a really uncomfortable feeling on the first floor was a phone repair shop with two sales reps at the counter david nervously asked one of them if they knew who george g was the man responded are you here to serve him dave laughed and asked how he knew that the man told him that they get people in here every week attempting to serve george g so this dude has been running from people for quite a while i need to tell you here that reddit really helped in this investigation one user urijnzael told me about colorados secretary of state website i used it and found another business address for the same company david and i drove there but the office space was completely empty those were the only two leads i had i felt defeated and without closure the last resort i had was a user usemyonov who offered his private investigative services to me on another thread i messaged him and within one hour i was on the phone with him giving every piece of information i had about the defendant semyonov well refer to him as pi told me to give him a few hours and hed call me back sure enough within an hour he called and went through the full background on george g a hispanic male in his early swho has liens and judgments against him stemming all the way back from the defendant has been all over colorado since setting up at least small businesses all with multiple po boxes the addresses were impossible to find and the phone numbers were bunk one address happened to be a prison in my hometown of canon city co so we assumed he was a convicted felon the multiple businesses this man set up was a telltale indicator of money laundering activity he had filed for bankruptcy twice but he recently sold a business in for over so he wasnt exactly poor unfortunately despite the full record pi pulled up there was absolutely nothing new for us to go on after a few back and forth phone calls from other attempts i told pi that he had done his job and that i had felt a strong sense of peace knowing that not only have dozens of people attempted this very same thing before to no avail but that i had exhausted every resource available to me i went back home and relaxed for the day minutes later my phone rings pi called and told me that he tried another database one that usually doesnt pull up many results however this time an address popped up for a home about minutes north of me in commerce city the home is owned by an asian couplebut the utilities are in the name of the defendant pi told me that he could do surveillance of the home at an hourly fee but i told him that i would go by and see if i found anything first i got in my truck and drove to the address the home was among an absolutely gorgeous neighborhood surrounding a golf course each of them worth k i rounded the corner for the address and two houses down the grey dodge ram was sitting in the driveway the license plates matching the photos i took he was at the fucking house i drove down to the end of the street and called pi i needed him served right here right now while we still have a chance i met up with him at a king soopers grocery store about two blocks away and he went through the game plan he would park across the street and use his binoculars to spot george all the pi needed was a visual confirmation and the papers would be served both the pi and me carry concealed so i parked two houses down and stood on the sidewalk as pi pulled across the street as pis brakes quietly squeaked as he stopped george came outside and started loading his truck he was getting ready to leave somewhere pi got out of his car and had his cellphone in his shirt pocket recording the entire exchange pi asked are you mr george g no george replied well does he happen to live here no no one by that name lives here oh really because i know what you look like and your plates and vehicle match up to you are you profiling me bro dudedont pull that crap with me george surprisingly answered okay pi gave him the documents we served the douchenozzle we got him we had his address at this point he has to either move to another residence or pay the full amount in order to get out of this mess george and i exchanged looks as he turned to walk back into his house papers in hand i gave him a huge smile and i walked back to my truck the pi and i met around the corner and i left my truck running while i came up to his car to sign the paperwork and pay him for the services rendered while i was signing i heard my phone ring through the trucks bluetooth i walked back and picked up my phone with the words private number sitting across the screen my adrenaline shot up and i could feel my eyes dilate there was absolutely no one else who would call from a private number at this time so i picked it up while the pi was scrambling to begin recording on his phone i answered hello a calm smooth voice replied whats up cracker i answered back with a derogatory expletive that i will not repeat george threatened im coming to your house tonight and im gonna come up on you oh yeah how do you know where i live i had intentionally left my address off of his copy of the service notice doesnt matter you better watch your back you pudgyass mother fucker im not even fat as i answered back the phone hung up the pi wasnt able to record the exchange but he pointed to my dash cam the thing that had already been quite the useful tool before it was running the whole time with audio to go with it the pi and i parted ways and on the way back to my house i called hoping i could get him arrested i reported the threat he had just made i was shaken mostly by the tone of voice george had plus the fact that he had spent time in prison he had nothing to lose so why wouldnt he kill me for the police officers wereyou guessed itunhelpful they told me it wasnt a real threat because he didnt specifically use key words like gun or knife or even hurt so they refused to come out but i could go in on monday to request a restraining order it was friday night and a piece of paper wasnt gonna do much anyway i was thankful that i was carrying at the time and that i had more than one weapon at home i went home and did a quick google search if you type in my name and zip code which was on the copy of paperwork george received my home purchase is public fucking record the very first result is my address great so i started packing my weapons into my truck set my home video cameras to record talked to my neighbors had my roommate go to her friends house for the weekend and left i met up with the pi who attempted several times to get the police to come out and at least file a report to no avail after waiting for a while i went to my girlfriends house and stayed there for the weekend periodically logging in to my cameras from my tablet and checking on the house fortunately he didnt show up and my neighbors didnt report a grey ram driving around the area i laid low for the next three weeks my bumper got fixed and this morning i walked into the courtroom with my pages of pertinent documents videos and audio recordings and waited george didnt show up and the surprisingly very rude judge ruled in my favor by default for a total of my next step is to have pi go back and serve him with interrogatories a piece of paper which has him declare any assets his banking accounts etc if he is served the interrogatories and he does not comply a bench warrant is issued for his arrest throughout this whole time george hasnt done anything illegal technically colorado driving laws state that insurance is not required on private property which the home depot parking lot is so im hoping to get these papers served and get a criminal charge against him if i dont its really not a big deal i got under his skin enough that he had to call and threaten me and that makes me a happy man seriously thank you all for the advice and well wishes this was a great ride and it would be awesome if a local newspaper could pick this up i reached out to news and fox denver a few weeks ago and neither have replied i highly recommend usemyonovs services hes an incredible pi with a ton of patience and understanding and is very good at walking you through the entire process any fucking questions
theres a disabled man cerebral palsy that lived in my town up until recently who uses his disability to make his living he sued several local businesses for ada violations even if he never bothered to enter the some of the stores some settled their suits and paid him a nuisance settlement with an agreement for him not to come back other smaller businesses just closed their doors and everyone was out of work he sued the business i work for even though it was a new location and completely inspected and certified as ada accessible by the state we decided to fight him to the bitter end early on we counter sued for our costs in the event we prevailed which is a common practice in cases like this the case got nasty hed come in ranting cursing and literally screaming at me all a part of trying to provoke me into saying something that would help his case while he was video recording the encounters throughout the ordeal he had an almost sociopathic attitude and we finally trespass warned him from the property that didnt stop him from coming in and he wound up going to jail twice for trespassing the case continued and we finally went into depositions where our lawyer ripped his case to shreds he freely admitted he had sued us wanting a settlement and didnt expect us to fight him the case continued to progress through time until we finally filed a motion for summary judgement we won the case was thrown out and we were awarded a judgement for our costs which were covered by our insurance totaling the revenge he moved to a nearby town where he continues suing businesses i set up a google news alert for his name he sued another business the regional paper picked it up in their legal briefs column i got the email and wasted no time calling my attorney and then the defendant involved to offer my help heres how we worked it our attorney filed a motion to assume his case using our judgement as a vested interest in the outcome of his case the court agreed and we took his case over and then immediately settled it for there wasnt a damn thing he or his shithouse lawyer could do about it he can expect this more times before we quit and im determined to follow through with it it brings me joy to put effort into ruining his little shit game
so this story is from quite a while ago in one of those endangered white rhinos of the retail world a chain video store my chain store had a lot of management turnover as well as franchise turnover meaning we were passed between a couple of franchise groups before landing somewhere in limbo this along with the fact that all of the employees knew the management login and password meant that we had more power than we should have and little to no threat of firing or legal repercussions i remember a kid lifting and selling a bunch of new releases of lotr before the official release date now being a family place the nd biggest national chain and being the store with the biggest selection in an area of uppermiddleclass suburbstowns we had a lot of issues with entitled mombies and kids but this was one of my favorites there were of us manning the counter so i stepped out and started asking customers if they needed help finding anything there was a mother with kids the youngest being a toddler in diapers wandering around the video game section i asked if they needed help and was given something of a harrumphsigh in response lacking a translation for frumpy groan i simply said i was around and if they needed help just holler i noticed the toddler was tugging on his diapers and doing a duck walk but being and not experienced with kids i wasnt aware just what that signified note that she never asked to use the restroom or indicated that there was an issue i did the rest of my rounds and returned to the video game aisle where i noticed what looked like a trail of chocolate covered raisins leading to the toddler thinking the little shit had helped himself to our treats which were stupidly in reach of grubbey little shits i looked for the box only to see another round one drop from the groingoblins leg i was a bit shocked with that but then he started pulling at his diaper dropping more and more while mom is ignoring his whimpers and waiting in line i walk up behind her poke her shoulder and ask if she would like some rags a bag and cleaner to take care of her little shit monster and she replies that it isnt her job and isnt that what we are getting paid for now she is spots back in the line so i tell her that i can help her out on my register i scan her card and promptly note on her account that her kid had shit allover the floor and that their account was permanently disabled i told her that the system wasnt taking that card and asked if there was another account for their family there was one for their teen and one for the husband i got the phone number and looked up the other accounts repeating the same note to all of them and using the manager code to mark all of their quite substantial late fees as to be sent to collections i then smiled and cut the card up in front of her and told her that since she cant respect the store or the employees and since she is unable to control her children and refused to clean up after them that she her accounts were locked and that she was banned she tried to use the other accounts but i told her they were irreparably locked too and that her household was flagged so they couldnt get any new cards she flew off the handle screaming and shouting yelling that cleaning the floors there wasnt her job it is when your pantystain decides to shit all over it and that she would call the manager owner or corporate and report me i told her to go ahead nothing would happen to us she grabbed her kid still dropping nuggets and screamed for the rest of her brood loading them into the van and peeling out of the parking lot with her middle finger raised she called back that night asking for a manager and i had a real fun time pretending to be chuck the territorial manager not a real person i told her she and her family were banned from any stores in the district and that we would be pressing charges if her or any of her family tried to open up a new account i ended up having to clean up the shit which sucked so i called up the other video store in the town and let them know what had happened or that they were habitual shop lifters i cant remember but they ended up banned from there they tried coming in and renting a few times even trying to set up new accounts but each time they were flagged both because the incident and their late fees which i guess they couldnt pay off now that the account was locked and they were sent to collections for them but i have no sympathy they ended up getting sent to collections and having a lot of issues due to that and tried to call and write the store to make impotent legal threats but i had made sure to put notes up on the desk and the system they came into another job i was working a year or two later and started yelling at me asking why i ruined their lives i told them the truth it was because their actions in the video store were reprehensible and that we didnt need customers like that i also said that if they returned their videos on time they wouldnt have had fees and then they wouldnt have gone to collections i suggested that they perhaps learn from this experience and readdress how they treat retail employees this just further enraged them the husband was in my face they were asked to leave and banned from there as well seriously though if she would have even apologized i would have let it go but having to clean up her kids shit and deal with her attitude that in my mind at least justified the repercussions tldr mombie lets loingoblin shit all over my video store and cops an attitude and the family gets banned and gets their credit cornholed as a result
so my wife and i live in an old victorian style house in a college town split into two apartments our bedroom downstairs and a bedroom upstairs the first year it was occupied by nursing students who were great they all finished their rotations and moved out and we got a set of mba students who were douches at first we thought oh theyre young well politely complain when they dont clean up their dog craphave a tuesday night keggerplay cod so loud it rattles our windows theyll figure it out and it will be ok well it wasnt their response to our requests were annoyance and noncompliance which opened the door up for me to engage is passive aggressive revenge tactics and i have many stories from the year they resided above us one monday morning after a pretty raging party upstairs i came outside to find my car parked in by the upstairs neighbor my wife had nicknamed cunthammer ch for short now in the lease we had exclusive use of the driveway upstairs were supposed to park on the street however they often parked behind us when street parking was scarce so i knocked on the door to get them to move the car so i could go to work only theres a problem ch has left that morning on spring break vacation he wont be back for two weeks after i had recovered from contemplating exactly how much of a syphilis ridden wanksock of a human being you would have to be to illegally park in your downstairs neighbor and then leave for two weeks i rang the non emergency police line and explained my situation they tried to contact ch to no avail so my legal recourse was to have the car towed to a legal vacant spot on the street at my own expense which given i had to go to work was what i would have to do while i was waiting for the tow truck i hatched a mature and a juvenile revenge plan juvenile plan first i got a bottle of dot brake fluid and a rag out and utilizing the extent of my artistic abilities painted a big old cock and balls on the hood with a pew pew pew of pee going over the roof and left it to bake in the mature part of the plan came to fruition when the tow truck arrived our city has a penchant for street sweeping and tow cars enthusiastically when doing so they had just put up signs down one side of our street notifying that they would be sweeping in four days i reserved a spot that side of the road for chs car and had the driver put it there i let him in on the plan as he was contracted to tow cars for the city that day he giggled a lot at my slowly emerging cocknballs artwork and said hed try and pick up chs car early knowing that if he was away for two weeks his company would be able to rack up a nice storage fee the day came and the tow driver who moved the car came straight to chs car and towed it i had dropped a note in chs letterbox explaining without being rude that he had parked me in and i had to have his car moved at my expense so i could go to work cue him coming back and furiously pounding on my door wheres my fucking car he demanded i explained i had moved it to the other side of the street into a legal car space because neither the police or i could contact him the city had swept the street last thursday they had towed it hed need to call the city he stormed off furious only to return a few hours later apparently the combination of the citys fine the tow fee and ten days storage totaled over and his car had been hilariously vandalized at the tow yard he demanded i pay i politely declined suggesting that he might try small claims court if he could demonstrate id done anything i was liable for he never took me up on the offer the artwork had come out great the car had been left in the rain so the giant dick on the hood of his beat up civic had rusted in apparently it even earned him the nickname dickwheels in class 
this one dates back a way to the late s a friend of mine had a small flat as accommodation partly subsidised by the university he studied at there were about flats at this location and they were built in pairs so everyone shared a wall and roof with their neighbour my friends neighbour was a mess of a kid ill call m who came into second year uni having barely scraped through the first and spent just about all his available time with loud music smoking and getting drunk with friends over the flats were tiny but m still managed to cram in half a dozen people several nights a week and the stereo jacked up high with bullshit music and bass far too high my friends complaints about it fell on deaf ears he tried talking to m who promised to turn it down did so for a minute or two then turned it up again m stopped answering his door when my friend knocked he confronted m in the car park and asked again and m dismissed my friends complaints with its just fuckin music mate and went on his way police said everyone at the campus needed to learn to get along and did nothing but talk and the university itself was tied up with bureaucracy and nothing ever came of his complaints to housing admin so we took things into our own hands the roof cavity shared between the two flats had only one access hole in my friends bathroom we dragged a subwoofer up there and hung it from the rafters over the top of the main room in ms flat and connected it to my friends pc with a soundboard app of music with heavy bass first time round it worked a treat and we were careful not to go overboard in case m found what we were doing m would turn the music up wed soundboard it with more music on top and the stereo would go down again while he listened for what was making the extra noise and it gave a tiny bit of relief m didnt stop with the music bullshit but knowing we could really annoy him back was a little victory then another of our friends suggested something absolutely genius he helped rig up a microphone epoxied to the ceiling plaster in the cavity directly above ms stereo the mic fed into the pc which recorded the sound from ms house applied a delay and fed the bass back to the hidden subwoofer just a couple of seconds did the trick to make the music unbearable whenever m turned his music up the sub would kick in and play back a little of ms own music on loop stop then listen again for more the first night we had it going was fine tuning the second was absolutely perfect one and a half seconds delay was killer we sat in our friends flat listening to ms stereo go up and down up and down in the middle of one of his parties until he got so pissed off at it that he and his friends left and took their party elsewhere two nights later same thing m had his music up and we let it run clean then as soon as more people arrived to his flat on came the subwoofer and delay and m had a temper tantrum we thought would end them all a couple weeks later m was home by himself and had the stereo up again for an afternoon trying to diagnose the problem and with delay after delay after delay he completely lost it he had an epic temper tantrum to beat the last one and screamed broke furniture and smashed up his own walls one simple report to housing admin that he was physically damaging the place and the bureaucratic cloud lifted and they came down on him amp he was kicked out from start to finish it took just over four weeks to get rid of him the next neighbour was a pretty sensible guy with no overbearing insistence that his music was what everyone else had to listen to and got on well with my friend mission accomplished and all that
obligatory long time first time please excuse any formatting errors i am on mobile this is a tale of elementary school pro revenge i was in fifth grade and i will be frank with you no one liked me i was chubby and socially inept this revenge begins with myself and a classmate we will call jimmy jimmy didnt like me he made a sport of harassing me and i being the delicate ten year old flower i was was naturally distraught on account of his behavior he would exclude me from activities and lunch groups but the final straw was on valentines day jimmy enacted a diabolical plot and i did not receive a single valentine in my shoebox i was crushed after the valentine snub he made sure he rubbed salt in my wound by asking to see my valentines and then laughing when i said i didnt have any i wasnt about to take that sort of cruelty lying down so i hatched a plot i spent days and days talking up this new candy type breath spray i had i went on and on about how delicious it was and how my dad got it abroad and you couldnt get it here of course jimmy was intrigued and asked to sample it i declined and explained that it was so special and rare that i just couldnt spare any one day before lunch i was talking about how delicious it was and could see the hunger in little jimmys eyes i pulled my bottle of glasses cleaner out of my backpack and slipped in my desk all fake sneaky like i knew he had seen it it was about ten minutes after this that my plan came to fruition i was walking down the hall and heard a hullabaloo of sorts so being a curious young lass i asked what the fuss was about turns out jimmy had snuck into my desk and drank my glasses cleaner and by the time he realized his horrible mistake he had swallowed enough to make himself quite ill an ambulance was called and that little bastard never bothered me again as a side note as an adult i now realize how dangerous this was tldr a kid bullied me so i poisoned him
so a few weeks back i sort of got a for deal on revenge but to explain how i need to give a little backstory the first asshole i met in college asshole classmate he was in my major he was the laziest asshole ever our department was lacking students so they allowed him into the program to avoid budget cuts anyone unfortunate enough to get stuck with asshole classmate on a group project was pretty much doomed to do the whole project themselves it was a project built for a group of people to complete in a month being in his group was an automatic c he never did work and in my case managed to lose all of our work after taking it home to copy it despite contributing literally nothing he felt entitled to put his name on the project and display it in his portfolio if he wasnt allowed to get his way we stopped letting him sign his name on our projects he failed senior and junior year he badmouthed you and threatened to call all of your future employers my senior year at that school i got a job in my field it was honestly just a crappy job that was marginally better than the unpaid externships were expected to do i had a crappy boss asshole boss he had me do all the dumb office stuff like make him coffee and complain that i was bad at it i dont drink coffee he was the typical spoiled brat son inheriting a company from his dad he was fond of reminding me that if he knew how to use the software and the tools i did he could also do my job and that he was learning how so that he could get rid of my position to the revenge im out of school i got a much better job offer so i politely told him to go eat a dick of course i got fired for insubordination but i get that sweet unemployment pay until my next job kicks in he fired me at an inconvenient time for his company their biggest company is expecting prototypes from us four of them no one knows how to do them aside from me their customer will be there in three weeks in a panic nice supervisor asks if i know anyone that can do job i check facebook asshole classmate is still unemployed i tell him to apply he thanks me profusely nice supervisor thanks me profusely asshole classmate goes to interview with asshole boss proceeds to badmouth me claims he carried me the whole way in college i check his online portfolio my projects are on there with my watermark still on them asshole boss hires him their customer comes in one week from today nothing has been done asshole classmate calls in sick too much nice supervisor calls me to tell me she is quitting because asshole boss is taking out his anger on everyone asshole classmate complains that no one appreciates him that customer has been waiting for that prototype for months he is over of their current business and is not happy with them they will possibly go out of business because of this also i got my friend who is an attorney to send asshole classmate a cease and desist letter to take my work off of his portfolio i posted that letter as well as screenshots of him stealing my work on our fields professional network good luck getting a job now

background growing up i lived with my parents in a three bedroom condo unit on the second floor there was only three condos in a unit so we had only one apartment above us and one below us the unit is apart of a few blocks worth of condominiums and its like its own little community all the neighbors know each other and were always around to offer a helping hand it was an awesome quiet little nook filled with families in what was otherwise a very busy part of a large city my parents still live there after years since they bought the place when they first immigrated to america my parents are for the most part very friendly people and had good relations with all our neighbors below us lived a nice eastern european family and above us a large asian family who despite the sheer amount of people living there we never heard a peep from them they were all on friendly terms but it was very much a situation of i wont bother you so dont bother me my entire childhood there was never any bad blood between any of the neighbors and for the most part everyone just did their own thing and lent a helping hand once in awhile as a side note my father worked in construction since he was a young kid and building codes are essentially his bread and butter within the department of buildings and fire department in my state he cultivated a reputation over the past years as being one of the foremost experts in understanding building codes and spotting potential issues on any job site instantly this is important to remember now on to the story the trouble didnt start until about years after my parents moved in and the nice large asian family living in the unit above us decided to move out and sold the property the new owners did a full renovation of the apartment what they failed to do was properly insulate the floors again which meant we heard every step every little noise this family made at all hours of the day seriously it was bad especially when youre trying to sleep in only to be woken what sounds like a rolling bowling ball on the floor at am on a sunday when this problem first occurred my father went and spoke to the owner he explained how by not adding insulation was a violation of several building codes and also a direct violation of the condominium contract they signed that stated that insulation in floors and wall is a must this asshole owner ao pretended not to speak english even though we constantly heard him yelling in english on the phone my dad was quick to call him out on it and when ao was caught he started yelling in asian accented broken english that he couldnt understand him and that my dad needs to learn english now english is not my dads first language or even his third he taught himself when he first came to america and got a job as a bellhop in a fancy hotel by reading newspapers he has a heavy eastern european accent but you can easily understand him and hes comfortable enough to hold a long conversation with someone in english to hear this man yelling at him to learn english was not only rude but downright insulting ao did this every time my dad tried to approach him about it during the time of his renovation to change the floors after six months there were no more contractors coming into the unit and it was clear that ao had no intention of fixing the floors my dad tried one more time and got the exact same response from ao my dad said fuck you ill see you in court i dont remember the exact way of how things were done but i know my dad got a building inspector to see the place and they were issued at least a few fines for violations but still refused to fix the floors my dad then took them to court using a decibel meter to measure how loud the sounds from their apartment were to us this trial lasted two years before the judge issued them a court order to fix the floors and ordered them to pay a set amount to my dad again ao paid the money to my father but after six months still didnt fix the floor in fact in those six months it was louder than ever it felt like they were purposely walking louder running and moving furniture at all hours of the day i had taken to sleeping with music on to block out the noise my father had enough it was then he decided to take things into his own hands he placed some orders on the phone and got my uncles together one morning they came back with huge boxes from the electronics store they used the money from the court settlement to buy several thousand dollars of those heavy bass speakers you see in clubs and in stadiums now remember my father knows his stuff after years and years of both working on construction sites and working as an engineer for the next three days my father and my uncles all strategically cut holes in our ceilings one hole in every room in the house they would mount a speaker inside do the wiring and then strategically insulate it so they could direct the sound then they patched the holes right up as if there was never a hole there to begin with that very night they finished all the work we were relaxing in the living room watching a movie when the stomping and running starting my dad casually leaned over to our stereo system and turned it on i saw him fiddling with it for a moment before he turned the volume up all the way faintly from our ceiling came the sounds of cotton eye joe we could just barely hear it with the television on inside but when you stepped onto the balcony that was directly below the balcony of the people living upstairs it sounded like they were blasting music from their apartment my father played that song on repeat for over an hour and well into the night they stomped angrily on the floor for a good while but still that song played on they banged on our door which my father answered and yelled at him for playing the music he just opened his door wider so all you heard was a loud tv and my dad said you guys are the ones making the noise and closed the door in his face for the next year whenever the neighbors were running or stomping around my dad would blare cotton eye joe on full repeat they called the cops on us a few times but my dad would just turn off the music and show the cops the court document that stated it was the neighbors with the noise violations after about two times the cops never came again ao moved out after a year and a half enduring cotton eye joe the place stood empty for awhile until my dad found out that ao decided to rent the place out without fixing the floors again for the next few years that place must have gone through at least eight different people renting it my dad always spoke with the renters before they moved in and explained the court order on the apartment on the noise level whenever they got noisy my dad had no problem blaring cotton eye joe on full blast a few months ago the unit went on the market real estate agents had to disclose that there was a court order on fixing the floors in this apartment two days ago my father closed on the upstairs unit at almost half the cost of the original listing price tldr where did he come from where did he go where did he come from cotton eye joe edit i just spoke to my sister and she reminded me of how at one point we heard them ripping up the floors to look for the source of the noise because of they way the insulation was placed they could never find exactly where the speaker was located i remember they looked for it for a good while and then right after the construction noises stopped was when we came home to find a moving truck outside edit my dad is getting a kick out of your comments he wanted me to tell anyone who is thinking of following his example is to put the speakers in an insulated wooden box with the speaker side facing up and then line the insulation a few feet around the speaker this is supposed to direct the sound so that its coming from several directions at once and he answered some additional questions for me he did approach the board about it before the lawsuit but they told him they cant do anything about it because it was a private matter and was only effecting him and not the everyone also ao was responsible for a lot of his legal fees so my dad did not lose much money on this whole thing 
let me just start this story off by saying that the guy who did this apparently has a long history of doing similar things and just generally being a dick although i didnt know this at the time so this has been a long time coming to him earlier this year i got an innocent friend request from a guy named nick over facebook he didnt seem familiar to me but we had a dozen friends in common so i figured id probably met him online somewhere and just didnt remember exactly where from it wasnt so bad at first he didnt really comment on any of my posts nor did he send me pms and so i quickly forgot about him a couple of months later i make a completely innocuous post on facebook the topic of which escapes my memory but let me assure you that it was completely benign and was not insulting or dramatic at all in any way one of my online female friends amber responds and then nick starts commenting too which i think nothing of at first but then amber has the audacity to disagree with him and thats where the shitposting begins within seconds i was getting hundreds of notifications from that post all from nick in response to my friend amber cordially disagreeing with him he decided to start spamming i quickly butt in and very politely canadianproblems asked him to please stop spamming my wall his response was then to stop spamming letters and to start spamming pictures of his dick instead i was trying to delete them but he was posting them faster than i could delete so i once again politely asked him to stop spamming dick pics on my post because i had real life friends and family members on my facebook account including my mom my dad my brother my opa and all of my cousins aunts and uncles on both sides of my family for some reason he took this as a challenge and started spamming pictures of his dick onto every single post on my facebook wall at this point i had gotten pretty tired of asking nicely so i just deleted him off facebook and sighed heavily as i proceeded to spend the next fifteen minutes cleaning up my wall it took him approximately seconds to begin spamming his cock via private message instead i asked him once to stop he kept going having realized by now that he was not going to stop i then blocked him problem solved nope within minutes i am receiving dozens of dick pics from multiple other obviously fake facebook accounts from the exact same guy i block all of them but they just keep coming at one point i counted that he had over twenty alternate accounts probably for the express purpose of harassing women over facebook as i was to learn later this went on for weeks every now and then after believing that id blocked all of his accounts he would send me another message or i would get a friend request from someone who i thought i knew and it would start all over again it even got to the point where he had managed to track me down on some other websites and was sending me dick pictures on them too i naively use the same username for everything i should probably fix that one innocent day i logged on facebook and bam there he was again dick pics in my inbox something finally snapped in me and i said fuck it if he wants to play this game then im going to do it better i unblocked him on his main facebook account he noticed within a couple of hours and started sending me pictures again i very clearly told him im going to give you one more chance to stop if you dont then know that you are responsible for what i do next another dick pic okay then here we go i casually peruse his facebook profile within minutes i spot the information im looking for the first thing i do is type up a very polite and concerned message about nicks appalling behavior to his lovely sister and adoring mother did they know that their brotherson was in the habit of sending pictures of his meat and two veg to random women on facebook against their will could they perhaps talk to him for me im at my wits end i just dont know what else to do im just a nice canadian girl i dont know how to handle this sort of thing just for good measure i also include a screenshot of some of his many many pictures the second thing i do is take a peek at his place of employment and the city that he lives in i put the information through on google and find that there are only two locations of the restaurant he works at in the area where he lives okay good so he must work at one of these two places its am and im not doing anything else i start calling i tell my sad sad story of harassment to the managers could they maybe help me locate him one of the managers coincidentally happens to not only be his manager but also the mother of his best friend she is completely disgusted when she hears what i have to say and promises to speak with him about it the third thing that i do just for good measure is tell him everything that ive just done just because i wanted to watch him squirm at first he arrogantly asserts that i must be bluffing he believes that hes hidden his tracks well enough to avoid being tracked down he confidently demands that i tell him the names of his mother and sister to prove that im telling the truth so i do and his phone number and his address and his place of employment a lengthy lapse in the conversation occurs understandable of course he needs time to process less confidently he begins trying to convince me that his sister and mother dont care so i should go ahead and do it anyway so that they can all have a big laugh about it later im not convinced his sisters facebook is full of posts about church and gods love i seriously doubt that she is the type of person who would approve of sending photographs of your genitals to unsuspecting strangers over the internet with the intent to harass them i tell him that ive already done it so i guess well find out soon enough if hes right he writes one more halfsneering halfterrifiedoutofhiswits message and then logs off game set match i win following this comment is a series of screenshots that i took to prove that my story is true the bestworst part of all of this is that his sister actually responded to me and shockingly this was not the first time he had done this i also spoke to a mutual friend of ours about him who told me that a girl that we all used to know had accused him of attempting to rape her while she was passed out drunk on his couch she never had him charged or anything but i found out later that he was wellknown in our group of acquaintances for being somebody who regularly harassed and assaulted women and even occasionally men trigger warning explicit photographs of male genitals in the link edit if you have a question about the veracity of this post please try reading the comments because there is a fairly high chance that i already addresses that specific concern at some point thank you i am super getting tired of people making the same accusations at me that ive already answered four times in other comments edit if you require more proof please pm me personally about it i do have more screenshots i just decided to take them down off here because i think people were able to track him down using the information in them and i dont really want to doxx him
a summers afternoon i found myself in the rafters of a warehouse meticulously spacing out zip ties at each cm running cate cables capped off with shielded rj ends i am a man who is very particular about his wiring and this day was no different by this time i was about days into the job and my big bundle of cables was almost done the veins of my network were spread throughout the building and everything was beautifully measured off and bundled together in a trunk of cables held together by velcro binders and color coded zip ties all in all i had spent over worth of time in this project and well over worth of equipment the day came to collect payment the payroll person wasnt there so i dropped off the bill on her desk day passes almost a week before i call them and ask them about it and they give me the run around i did it as professionally as possible i emailed i called i left messages and nothing the bill was sitting at i thanked my providence to have had them pay for the equipment before i installed everything weeks flew by and they stopped answering my calls specifically and my emails it was time i sent them an email telling them that at the day mark as per our agreement of nonpayment the bill would have a late fee of and i would shut down their server early on the th day i logged into their server and changed the passwords and set it to shut down i had a bios password so there was no way they were going to have someone else come and reset the server theyd lose everything all of their data from the last years was locked onto that server and i waited at am the next day i got a frantic call from the owner telling me something was wrong i asked him to check his email and he told me that he read it but that they needed the server back on they were losing so much money so i went over and walked inside and was greeted with disingenuous smiles and fake hellos the owner talked to me about pleasantries and started leading me to the server i asked him if he was serious and that i wasnt doing anything until i got paid for the job the late fee thats when everything kind of went to hell the owner got really upset and started trying to string together something coherent and eventually just got up in an angry huff and proceeded to have the payroll person type me up a check i took the check and left directly to their bank to cash it after telling them id be back in an hour or so i took the money and banked it at my bank once i got back i forgave them for trying to guess passwords of the bios and logged back into the server and started everything running i billed them for my time and got payment before i left i never heard from them again 
this happened years ago but i was thinking about it yesterday and decided to write it now so once upon a time i was married it was a good relationship for the most part good communication and seldom any arguing over time my wife meets a guy lets call him dan dan on the surface seemed like a cool dude he and my wife worked together and seemed very close i didnt really care they were coworkers everybody has that coworker theyre close to right over time i sense that dan and my wife are getting too close she texted him constantly and i started getting suspicious but i didnt want to say anything because i didnt want to come off as jealous one night i snooped through her phone and found some explicit texts she sent to dan it basically confirmed that a she was cheating on me and b she wanted to leave me for him even though i was pissed off that she cheated on me i also wanted to get out of this marriage asap the next day i sat her down and told her i knew everything there was a lot of tears on both sides and denying on her side but she finally confessed her affair she basically told me that she loves him and not me we agreed that we would get divorced amicably no alimony and whatever was ours before the marriage is ours after it it was a very quick divorce now as much as i wanted to kick the shit out of dan i didnt want to risk going to jail at this point they were in a relationship living together considering she has known him for less than a year at that point i knew things were going to end badly a couple of months after the divorce i moved to the west coast i had no communication with my ex from then until a month ago she messaged me on facebook and told me she was sorry for how she treated me and that shes miserable and misses me i decided to look through her profile shes married to dan has kids with him and theyre both horrendously fat apparently soon after they moved in together she became pregnant with his kid she had to quit her job because of the pregnancy and since then hasnt had a job they got married while she was still pregnant and had more kids theyre living off food stamps and government aid too at that point i felt vindicated i wanted to get revenge on her and dan for so long to see they fucked up their own lives so bad was good enough

this happened a few years ago but is honestly a very proud moment for me so im driving home from my parents house and its about oclock in the evening on a beautiful summer night they live in a small quiet suburb and im only a few towns over so the drive is usually pretty nice and peaceful however these towns tend to breed entitled pricks and bored teenagers i must have ran into the hybrid of the two as i was making my way down a mph i was going about road toward the center of my parents town i see one of those small honda hatchbacks in my rear view that is really low to ground and decked out with all kinds of stupid shit hes comin in hot and im thinking hes going to blow by me or something nope just gets right on my ass and at one point im pretty sure he even tapped my bumper i can see the stupid smirks on the faces of the driver and passenger we come to a stop sign and i do my best to do a full complete stop i reach over pull out a cigarette light it and enjoy a drag before i start to move again must have taken at least seconds may not seem like a lot but next time youre at a stop sign wait ten seconds and youll see how long that is anyway this aggravates him as he barely stops when he comes up to it and continues to very dangerously tailgate me so now i try the brake tap i pull up a little to give my self some room and hit the brakes forcing him to slam on his i found it funny cause he had to swerve to avoid collision he still does not heed his aggressive driving the revenge now we get to the big way intersection in the middle of town lanes at each stop he pulls up beside me i must have really scared him with the brake tap because he looked very flustered and wanted to say something to me he rolls down his window all my windows and sunroof were all ready open seeing as it was so nice that day and looks at me i look at him i was expecting some sort of verbal insult so i made myself ready hey you faggot piece a before he could even get that well thought out statement out of his mouth he was already choking on the lit cigarette butt i flicked directly into his mouth when some of my friends and i were younger and would just be hanging out we made flicking cigarettes a game we would set up little cans or targets near one of our habitual smoking places and we all became very good at it now i knew i could hit him in the face but i did not expect to get it into his mouth but i dont feel bad in the slightest the best part so while he is dealing with his new ashy dinner i turned left left turn lane he must have missed his turn to go while dealing with the cig so other cars started crossing the intersection im sure he was fuming mad so he peels out cuts across to make a left and almost hit cars in the process at least it looked like that through my mirrors i see him make his way onto the street i was on but right behind him was a cop who must have seen him commit about moving violations as he cross that intersection i see him pull over and i drive away feeling like a boss tldr guy dangerously tailgates me i flick a cig in his mouth and he gets pulled over by the cops edit spelling
i have been lurking on this sub for a long time and finally decided to write down my own pro revenge i will delete the post in case i feel threatened or uncomfortable but until then enjoy this is going to be a long storyas it took years to end so bear with me also english is my second language so pardon me for grammar mistakes everything started when i was around i was drugged sexually assaulted and very traumatized from that event i couldnt remember much from it only the cold feeling and some smells so i could never actually press charges against the rapist also i was very alone in the whole situation asside from a few friends i had i had no one to actually rely on my parents were emotionally abusive towards me so i learned not to trust them from my young age and telling them about my problem was out of question i just couldnt do it so it happened and it took me a lot of strenght to get back to my normal self i was depressed for a long time developed anxiety and became self destructive i drank way too much and did way too much drugs during that time i met a guy lets call him douchebag db for short i met db over facebook he claimed to have met me in the club which was possible yes i went to a club when i was no i didnt even need fake id he seemed nice and i even met him over a cup of coffee for a few times after a while i started really liking him but there was something just very off about him and i couldnt put my finger on it he was one of those rich kids spoiled little brat who liked to pretend he was very scary and important mafia style db was also years older and because he had money i never heard him talk about doing anything other than football and going to clubs i found it laughable but i let him believe what he wanted he also acted like he liked me in a sexual way but didnt do anything about it there were just some remarks that made me think that way he was also friends with people from my high school and this is important i hung out with him and we did regular stuff got coffee talked i would rant about my parents he would joke with me just normal stuff after a few months of our friendship i even told him what happened to me when i was he didnt show much emotion and asked a few questions that seemed too much but i didnt think much of it i was just glad i told someone months went by and i was less and less self destructive it dawned on me i needed to change my ways stop with the drugs alcohol and stupid friendships thats why when db asked to meet me for a coffee i told him no i realized along the way that he was shady as fucking hell his friends were weird i had no idea how he spent his days he treated me with little to no respect and he always chose small shady caffes to meet with me as if he was embarrassed by me i have had enough of it and told him so what i told him didnt phase him at all he left me alone as if i never mattered after a few months i started hearing rumors about myself they were so nasty so incredibly horrible and the whole school talked behind my back about it or even to my face i was called a slut and what not and spiraled into depression once again i didnt think db would do it because from time to time he would contact me and acted very nice and also he was not exactly the only person who could hate me you know how high school is the shit hit the highest point when i was almost by that time i somehow managed to deal with nasty shit people were talking about i managed to deal with threats of violence and name calling i also found a beautiful boyfriend he was my rock someone who i could rely on someone who took care of me and gave me comfort and safety i was with him for months and i have told him about my past i thought it was important for him to understand why i was who i was i kept my boyfriend very private i didnt share our relationship on facebook or any other social media i didnt talk about him a lot only a few people knew about it and that was the best decision i ever made db contacted me from time to time he kept telling me i changed and joked how he liked me better before because i was spontaneous and fun to be with yeah because doing fucking drugs and being suicidal in my free time was so much fun right i stopped speaking to him completely and again he didnt seem to care it was one month before my final tests in high school i was going to school studying hard and hung out with my boyfriend i was trying very hard to fix what i ruined years ago and that was me my reputation and my grades i was in school one day and checked my inbox on fb which i almost never did just to find a message from some guy i have never met asking if i was there against my better judgement i told him he might have sent the message to a wrong person and he immediately answered that he hadnt i was puzzled sitting in my german class and staring at my phone i asked who is he and the guy started insulting me calling me a whore and told me i will do what he tells me to do otherwise he will put the video of my rape online i was now freaking out to say the least i thought he had to be joking and told him so and that is when the worst message of my life came it was a picture of me a detailed picture to say the least i felt so sick i got up without saying anything to the teacher and got the hell out of that class barely holding myself together and bawling in panic as i stared at my phone the first thing i decided to do was call my boyfriend i could barely speak over the phone i was hysterical so he picked me up and took me to his place i told him about everything and then it started to make sense all of it db had to be a part of that shit my boyfriend told me to keep talking to the guy while he called a few people to see who this guy was he seemed to be in his thirties had a dog and lived in the wealthiest part of the city his fb profile was legit he existed and wasnt afraid of me knowing his real identity i asked what he wanted from me i would almost puke every time i had to answer but i had my bf with me and he was furious the guy knew my address and my mothers name and threatened with that too he said i can choose if i wanted to get naked on cam or have sex with him his ended up demanding that i meet up with him and have sex with him my boyfriend told me to invite the guy to meet with me in the open we knew he wouldnt want to sit and drink with me coffee but my bf couldnt let me just go to the adress this is where we made a plan and it was going to go down the very next day i had to meet with the guy on a little square near his place surrounded by a park it was remotely abandoned at that time of the day and i sat down on a bench shaking and trying to keep myself together my boyfriend told me this half of the plan but didnt actually tell me what he will do finally i was approached by the guy he seemed younger than i thought and wore that smug smile on his face that made my blood boil he told me to get the fuck up and follow him i was now terrified looking around for my boyfriend but he was nowhere to be found so i had nothing else to do than to follow the guy we were walking on a path i was few steps behind him and he wasnt even looking at me i was staring at the ground concentrated on not fainting all of a sudden the guy stopped in his tracks i stopped too in front of us was standing my boyfriend right in the middle of the path the guy seemed confused and turned around to me just to notice guys behind me my bfs best friends they were just standing there calm and silent now i didnt exactly describe my bf but this is the best description in a sea full of little fish he was a goddamn shark older than me his face full of scars and he radiated that superiority he knew how to be scary i suddenly could breathe my bfs best friend moved me out of the way grabbing my hand and pulling me in the other direction before shit starts i was so stressed at that time that i could barely walk and just as i rounded the corner i heard a muffled scream my bfs best friend took me to my bfs place and hugged me while i cried until my bf came back his hands were bloody his shirt too but i could see he wasnt hurt at that time i didnt ask what they did but my bf assured me i was safe now later i found out they beat the guy and made him tell them where the tape was they crashed his phone and went to his place where they destroyed all the blackmail material in front of the guy he admitted he was the one who raped me he stalked me and even sent his friend db to befriend me so he could control me and get info on me db was in on it the whole time later i found out db became well known for abusing barely legal teenage girls along with the guy they would blackmail girls and make them do nasty stuff and all the girls were alone just like i was db ended up getting beaten too ending up in hospital and the guy moved to another country soon i asked my bf if he did something to them and he just laughed but im just happy it ended and i dont even want to know im still with the same boyfriend we truly delivered pro revenge 
heres how the story starts freshman year i had a pretty good life moved out of my abusive moms and into my dads was pushed up to jv football made a lot of money selling weed made a lot of friends etc around sophomore year i got into acid and shrooms which pretty much fucked my life up ill just cut right to what happened i was raped i went to a party to sell weedbooze and ended up staying til about am got lit as fuck and decided to drop some acid while drunkhigh and on adderall blacked out and woke up near my school with no pants and my bike like feet away chilled with my close friends the next day and they all started making fun of me i barely remember what happened but apparently one of them it go down they started congratulating me on coming out of the closet called me a faggot played the song rap god repeatedly on my stereo and kept rewinding the gay bashing part so on i ended up kicking them out over the next few weeks is when shit got out of hand everyone knew i was gay after that got made fun of daily and life was just fucking terrible few people kept texting me things like hey man ill let you suck my dick if you give me some weed someone spray painted my car and put sugar in the fuel tank other shit too i ended up transferring schools which didnt help when i got to the new school almost immediately rumors went around that i fucked a tranny fucked a dog andor i fucked a guy at this point ive heard a lot but those were the main ones that stuck out to me anyway years later obviously never made any new friends and saved a lot of my drug money and got a job moved out and into a new state about a month ago moved into an apartment and going to college next semester before i left i got revenge i graduated months early and what im about to go into detail is over the course of the last few months before i left everyone i mention is still in school well some of them when shit initially went down i deleted every trace of myself on the internet facebooktwitter but i made alt accounts to keep up to date on what people were talking about me which was a big thing for awhile i screenshotted posts vulgar text messages anything and everything someone did to me i kept it i had it all saved on my computer never thought id go through with anything but my daily life was still a pile of shit thanks to this group of people so everything they ever did i had evidence of when i transferred schools my dad had to go to several meetings with my schools principle my school had a lot of bullying problems personally before i left i knew people who transferred schools freshman year alone because of shit like this one because she was a slut one because she was fat one guy who was homeless and the last i dont remember but at these meetings the principal told my dad that i could have the people who did this held accountable and the school takes this shit very seriously i said no way in hell my life was already a mess i didnt want to bring attention to myself i just wanted out years later i brought in about pages of me being shit on by fellow classmates online i went in after hours and she the principal was still there and remembered who i was i told her everything i just said now the rape not the drugs just said i was drunk the vandalism everything i told her how people at the new school started doing the same things to me as the people here how when i saw them in public they made a big deal about it how they ruined my life page after page of harassment bullying threats she brought in the schools police liaison who called in other officers we went through every single paged photocopied everything identified everyone involved and i filed numerous police reports people i essentially ruined the lives of people i believe most are facing felony harassment lawsuits as is one confessed to vandalizing my car one was immediately charged with possession of weed and paraphernalia they searched her car and i believe most were expelled on the spot none of them will receive their highschool diplomas unless they weasel out of it for years i sat in agony for the things these people did for years i thought about how i could get revenge if at all and what the best way to do it was out of all the things they did to me and everything that happened i can say without a doubt that after seeing their mugshots im finally at peace 
this is a little long sorry about that but ive been waiting decades to tell this story i grew up in a small town in the south summer jobs were hard to come by unless you wanted to drive an hour away to the city we had a few mechanics some gas stations a general store and a church on every block there were a lot of farms around that would hire high school kids but summers in the south are hot and humid the holy grail was an indoor job with air conditioning the summer before my senior year i thought that my buddies and i lets call them fred and ben had landed an awesome job at the general store the owner who i will call dickface needed three people to unload the trucks and stock shelves in the morning we had to report for work at am but it was only three days a week and we were done by meaning we had the rest of the day to lay around and fish now there were some red flags that i being young did not recognize at the time the fact that dickface wrote iou slips at the end of every week instead of checks was a huge one he promised to pay us in full at the end of the month we were kind of pissed that we wouldnt have money to spend but it was an easy job with good hours so we kept working looking forward to that sweet paycheck at the end of the month with it being an underthetable job there wasnt too much i could do the time comes dickface tells us at the end of our shift that our paychecks are clipped to our time cards ecstatic to finally be paid we go in open the envelopes and see that we have each been given a gift certificate to the store the strange and growing mixture of confusion and horror is a set of feelings that i will always remember fred ben and i approach dickface behind the cash register and tentatively ask when we are really going to get paid he looked at us like we were the dumbest people he had ever seen that is your pay he said we called bs and demanded real checks well i cant do that all i can give you is the gift certficiate what happened next was what youd expect from a couple of pissed off high school red necks obscenities were shouted some things were thrown fred kicked over a candy display we stormed out of there swearing and i was just seeing absolute red that fucker had used us for slave labor took advantage of some high school kids to get free work for a month it went without saying that we were thirsty for vengeance now this was a long time ago like preinternet predesert storm long ago and we lived in a very rural area so we couldnt just call some bureau of labor or go viral on social media or whatever people think of as revenge these days hell we couldnt even really tell our parents cuz they would have said it was a learning experience or some such thing there was really no concept of workers rights or anything like that hell in this particular state there still isnt to this day we had to handle this ourselves from then on we had nightly meetings on a piece of property owned by freds dad there was only one purpose one subject of discussion revenge we went through all the usual options arson vandalism and so on but in the end we decided that straight out theft would be the most reasonable option we were jipped for a months work and for the scales of justice to balance we needed payment as i said this was a long time ago dickface had some cameras but they were poor quality and there were only a few one out front one by the register and one over the beer coolers there were no cameras in the loading dock or the back room where the beer overstock was stored we knew this because we had seen the little monitor displaly in dickfaces office there was also an old doorway that was boarded over and sealed with polyurethane in the back of the building but was otherwise unsecured in other words our work was cut out for us we parked in the woods behind the store and watched it for a few nights to see if dickface had taken any additional security precautions in light of his deception he hadnt the closing cashier just locked the front door at pm and left we met up the next night at about am the town was dead asleep we piled into freds oversized pickup truck drove to the store killed the headlights and pulled up to the loading dock my heart had been thudding in my chest the whole drive over but now a sort of steel calm had come over me i was hyperalert yet calm as the eye of a storm our time had come the wooden door went down with ease when ben put his shoulder to it we slipped into the backroom stationed ourselves in a sort of assembly line by the beer racks and we unloaded the place cases of beer and jugs of wine practically flew out the back into freds truck with ruthless efficiency in the space of maybe less than twenty minutes we had the back room cleaned out we cleaned out that fucking prick so fast i dont think he would have had time to shit his pants if he somehow caught us we would have been done and gone we pulled the defunct door back into place threw a tarp over our loot and drove to the same property where we had held our vengeance meetings there was a disused tool shed towards the back behind some pretty thick bush and thats where we had decided to put everything unloading and carrying all the stuff took considerably longer than snatching it even with a wheelbarrow and the sky was starting to shade pink by the time we had it all squared away nevertheless we were all able to make it to freds house before his parents woke up and got suspicious the next few days were tense i saw two sheriffs deputies parked in front of the store the following day and felt the bottom drop out of my stomach we had come up with a cover story and rehearsed it multiple times in case we were questioned and i expected cops to come knocking on my door any second but they never did i never even saw a report on the local news in hindsight dickface probably knew it was us but didnt want it to get out that he had used slave labor in his store hell i bet the only reason he called the cops in the first place was so he could file a report and write it off on his taxes in any case we had hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars worth of beer sitting in an old tool shed and as young southern boys it would be a bleedin sin to let it go to waste we started celebrating cautiously at first but it didnt take long for word to get out that there were a couple of guys who could get their hands on beer and by the end of the summer we were hosting bonfires on the property that were absolutely packed with high school kids we even had some offering to buy the beer from us and by the beginning of september we had made back any money that we lost out on thanks to dickfaces slavery shenanigans these gatherings included a fair amount of chicks and i think its safe to say i lost my virginity thanks to the stolen beer in the shed it was the best summer of my life as for dickface i never saw or heard from him again he sold the store a year later to a guy who seemed much nicer i got another job working there the following summer for actual paychecks the beer didnt even run out till the start of senior year the last i saw of it was chugged by fred at the end of a football game tldr boss doesnt pay for a month of work we steal lots of beer get laid and have a great summer
on november th i was involved in a major vehicle accident year old kids fault i was in the hospital for days and was on disability home rest for months for recovery back issuesfused spine when i was coherent enough to deal with business i started talks with his insurance company from the very start they low balled me on price from just about everything value for a car kelly blue book valued it at and i had a brand new paint job on it from months prior their value and brand new tires not even months old valued a tire they brow beat me into thinking that this was how the processed worked nearly convinced me to settle this insurance company wanted to cut me a check for bucks and some change within minutes of talking to me the negotiations started horribly and i couldnt get them to budge for nearly a week i talked to my lawyer and he couldnt help but gave me great advice i got additional advice from my own insurance agent on how to deal with them and basically asked professionals on how to approach this it turns out this insurance company the kid used was the shadiest last resort of the last resort kind my lawyer who dealt with the medical bills not car issues told me edit removed apparent personal information with the record this kid had he was paying close to every months he was uninsurable by all standards but it was his insurance company that was the worst of the worst they were playing the waitingscare tactics game with me what they hadnt planned on was a guy with nothing but time on his hands and my jimmies had definitely been rustled i inquired on every single item in and on my car i located receipts got estimates on everything i had and bombarded them with faxes and paperwork at every opportunity i begged and pleaded with the companies i dealt with in estimates to over inflate the price of the cost repair for a leather jacket for a dell i laptop for designer jeans probably kirkland signature if i recall this insurance company only budged a bit on the fair market value price so they started playing a new game with me not taking my calls or not responding to my emails when my claims adjuster agent did call back my phone would ring once as in seconds and he would hang up so it looks like they made an attempt to call i would immediately return the call but would get your claims adjuster just stepped out of the office or hes headed into a meeting from the operatorreceptionist nearly weeks of these phone tag and email aversions games led me to create a detailed itinerary of my agents whereabouts and excuses of why he couldnt take my calls i then upped my game i called his bosses talked to other agents and told my story to all of them when that got no where i upped my game even more i called every hour on the hour for business days in a row i was on a first name basis with of his coworkers knew his supervisors name and bosses name and had all of their extensions and email addresses on speed dial i was even ccing all of them on every email i sent so my agent had excuse that he didnt get my calls shortly after a settlement offer was sent via email as he refused to talk to me at all over the phone in the amounts of for my vehicle and for my personal items i wanted and and wasnt going to settle for less he chose to make this personal and not business so i did the only logical thing i made it business in the worst possible way i called on a friday afternoon and left a message on ever coworkers phone as well as the supervisors phone that because my agent refuses to negotiate properly nor return my calls that i would now be calling all of them every hour on the hour as well as the supervisor and boss leaving detailed messages to call me back and offer me what my vehicle and personal items were worth i stated i would be starting this on monday morning am sharp needless to say by tuesday afternoon i had a settlement offer of for my vehicle and for my personal effects dollar figures that were very fair and almost generous in the industry but i replied back with the following see what bothers me is that i would have settled for less than this amount far earlier in the negotiations but after all this time and effort i will not settle for anything less than for my vehicle and for my personal effects i will start calling again tomorrow morning until these terms are met within hours of leaving that message i had a new email with the settlement offer of for my vehicle and for personal effects i accepted much to their delight tldr slimeball insurance company tries to use lowball and scare tactics to get me to settle for less than the value of my car i bombard them with phonecalls and emails every hour on the hour for almost weeks edit this post was temporarily removed because some unnamed redditor claimed pi was shown its since edited and the personal information removed and its now back up mod approved once again
ive been a real estate broker in chicago for nearly years i started at a very small independent brokerage it was my first week there when the brokerowner gave me a lead he was older and wasnt in very good health so he passed a lot of his leads to his agents one of the brokers friends passed away and the friends son wanted to sell the house i call the son who tells me hes known the broker for plus years and how close their families were he seems like a really nice guy i go over and check out the house i work up a gorgeous comparative market analysis i have other brokers check my numbers i was new and wanted to do a perfect job for my new client i rehearse my presentation have my stuff professionally printed prepare for any possible questions have responses ready for objections and i head out i dazzle this guy with my presentation he likes the list price i recommended hes fine with the commission he has no objections but he asks me to give him months to clean out the house give his siblings a chance to go through everything and then repaint now i know how to handle this but at the time i just said id call him in months to get it listed bad move but i trusted him because he and deceased father were so close with my broker i didnt expect what would come next three days later im driving through town and i see a for sale by owner sign in the yard thats when i realized that i wasted several hours doing work for him and he completely bluffed me and used me i didnt call him back then nowadays i wouldnt either but thats only because id have the listing before he had a chance to put that fsbo sign in the yard experience counts for a lot anyway my broker was at city hall about weeks later paying for transfer stamps when he just happened to notice in the registry that the previous customer was the son the son had just paid for transfer stamps earlier which essentially meant that the house had sold i waited until the prescribed months and called the son for my revenge i played stupid and the conversation went something like this me hey len its myzyri over at abc realty i figured id give you a call to see if you got the house cleaned out and repainted because i had a relocation company call me with info from a doctor looking to move to the area when i talked to the guy i thought about your house and mentioned it to him since its only blocks from the hospital where hes going to be working and i told him how nice it was he basically told me to make you an offer sightunseen i couldnt remember what i said the house was worth but i told him he couldnt believe how inexpensive it was but hes living in new york he said your house sounds like its three times the size of his and half the price of what hed pay in new york city so i dont remember what i told you it was worth but hes all cash and wants to be able to move in in weeks so would work for you because i can write it up fax it over to him for signatures and get you done there was a long silence before he exploded len you fucking asshole you told me it was worth me well we didnt even list yet and it looks like i just got you more what are you all upset about len i just sold that fucking house i sold it for because you fucking told me that was what i should expect to get me oh damn you sold it thats good for you and good to know that that my estimate on the sale price was spot on well no problem im sure i can find something else for my buyer len fuck your buyer i want me i dont know where youre going with this you sold your house for a price you were happy with i just happened to get an out of towner on a fluke who was willing to pay more but hey you sold it and you got fair market value so you did great len fuck you you prick i want that me ive never heard of this before but if you can get the house back i can talk to my buyer and see if hell wait for you to close again i dont know if thats even a possibility len no youre going to pay me me well thats not going to happen i can just hire a professional appraiser to show that you got market value for the house my mistake was quoting my buyer the wrong price not you len you can expect to hear from my attorney me thats fine but im going to have to let you go now len ive got to get over to your old house to see if the new owners would be willing to give me a copy of their appraisal and see if they might want to sell it for a quick profit do you know if they moved in already len mother fucker and thats when he slammed the phone down i would never do this now even though i have plenty of people who waste my time it comes with the job and getting upset doesnt make it better however i still think about that call today and while part of me feels like a jerk i still get a little smile thinking about him kicking himself for screwing me over heres a little more to the story something i do to drum up business is offer help finding tax comparables for people so they can try to get a tax reduction from the county i actually went to meet the new owners of that house and offered to help them dispute their taxes free of charge they were actually a really nice couple and they ended up using me to sell that house years later just before the market crash so theyd done some really nice stuff to the house had a top notch price and they ended up getting for it they were doing a backtoback closing sell one and buy the new one on the same day the house they were buying burned down but they still sold theirs and moved in with relatives while they looked for something new the market literally crashed two months later while they were living with the wifes grandparents they stayed there for two more years and then i helped them buy a huge square foot foreclosure for new construction that hadnt been completed just needed trim a garage some light fixtures and a kitchen which they were happy to install on their own considering the price and location its currently worth about since that area is just booming again theyve been very happy with me and have sent me a few referrals as a side note i told them about len a very watered down version that didnt make me look like a dick and they happily gave me a copy of their appraisal just in case he decided to call a lawyer they said he was a jerk to deal with and got into a huge fight with his siblings at the closing saying he should get more because he had to handle the sale and thats what the realtor would have charged no since his dad was close with my broker we were only charging him on soooo did he ever call a lawyer yes about a year later he called the only lawyer he knew another family friend my brokers brother the brother talked to my broker who then talked to me i gave him the market analysis and the appraisal we never heard another thing about it tldr guy uses me and wastes my time i end up giving him a bs story that makes him think he lost out on 
we all know the saying in order to make an omelette you gotta crack a few eggs a very down to earth saying with a lot of meaning and truth behind it i guess you can even apply this saying to revenge in some cases particularly my story of revenge a story of revenge so great that it might be one of the best cases of revenge so far in the year or at least i tell myself that in the end unfortunately there was some collateral damage but hey you know the saying i am a former marine living in a semismall town that i am not from trying to make ends meet while i wait for my tech school to start this summer ive been out of the marines for a few years now and after partying day in and day out and making ends meet by bar tending at various bars around my state i have finally convinced myself that its time to stop being a manchild and work toward a stable career hence ive enrolled myself in a tech school in the mean time i figured can squeeze as much as i can out of the service industry until i complete school and graduate well that was the plan and it still is but not at the restaurantbar i thought it would be i moved to this town from another state with my girlfriend due to a tragedy in her family after living off savings for a few months i decided to snag a job to make things easier to stay afloat i ended up at a quaint little restaurant very close to where my girlfriend worked a restaurant recently reopened by its corporate ownership after a terrible franchise owner had control of it all of the staff were new hires from the top to the bottom the restaurant was now full service as opposed to ordering at a counter it had a beautiful mahogany bar that meshed well with the theme of the restaurant that was sectioned off from the dining side of it great food and even better drink specials the perfect place for me to make ends meet while i attend school it was convenient in so many ways my girlfriend and i could save gas by driving in one vehicle when our schedules matched she could come eat lunch or dinner on her break and get a discount on food things just seemed perfect when i first started working at this restaurant management seemed to really like having me around i was very good at entertaining guests i brought people in to the bar and i was great at making drinks one night stands out the most i had a couple walk in to the restaurant minutes from closing often when this happens you will get a server who is upset that they have to do their job a little longer and that will reflect on their service not me it is their money and we are still technically open minutes until we close so i am going to treat these guests just like i would any other guest the couple clearly had a great night and left me a very big tip the next day i was shown an email that was sent to corporate with nothing but praises about my service and attitude i assumed it was from the same couple but who knows after that incident the atmosphere and managements attitude toward me seemed to negatively shift before we get into that though lets discuss the management team first we have the gm lets call him jack jack is a round man in his early s who on the surface seems like a stand up guy youd think hed have your back until the bitter end when you first meet him then we have nessa the assistant gm nessa is a short woman in her late s my first impressions was that she is a quiet but professional woman does things by the book and finally we have courtney courtney was the bar manageri will explain the quotations a little further in the story from the getgo courtney rubbed me the wrong way courtney was in her late s and never really smiled something about her just seemed dishonest i couldnt quite put my finger on it at first oh and i should also mention kara kara was a woman about years old and she was best friends with jack the gm she was the other bartender for the restaurant that would work shifts that i didnt work in the end i had nothing but great things to say about kara and i didnt want things to end the way they did but hey you know the saying now back to the story after receiving the positive review i noticed i would get flak from both nessa and courtney for little things they would reprimand me in rude ways without any tact one night nessa out of nowhere told me i was arrogant of course i defended myself and this caused a dispute that ended up with both of us apologizing i still have no idea what i was apologizing for but i just wanted a peaceful end to the matter another day courtney pulled me aside as i came in for my shift and told me that guests had told her that i was giving them free drinks she tried to get me to fess up to this and i vehemently denied the claims i even told her to check the cameras or i will have jack check the cameras i never ever stole from the bar or gave people free drinks then there was that time i came in for a shift and courtney immediately jumped down my throat for leaving tables a messlater proven to be a lie before leaving the bar after closing she says this as she walks out the door from her morning shift leaving three tables unbussed it was like something out of a comedy sketch another thing that may have struck you as odd courtney the bar manager was scheduling herself bar shifts while getting management pay odd right my theory on this sudden change of attitude toward me from the management is that it may have not been so sudden at all i dont think courtney liked me from the start i remember one time when i was training i had to make an easy drink for a guest because she didnt know how to make it she put pineapple juice n a long island iced tea yuck this was probably embarrassing for her and i remember the guest making a comment along the lines of maybe he should be bar manager hahaha said in jest but i could tell that it really upset courtney i also was told that by another employee that during a busy night over the holidays courtney told nessa and jack that she thought i was stealing from the bar i cannot verify these claims but after the conclusion of everything that happened i wouldnt put it past courtney this negative stigma toward me most likely rubbed off on jack because surely enough his attitude toward me changed i started to feel held hostage and regretting going to work i felt as though my stature was being diminished behind my back my reputation was being tarnished i was sinking in quicksand and had no way of defending myself when all these claims were made behind my back one shift my girlfriend was on her lunch break and while i was in the back getting side work done jack had made a rude comment to her or was very rude to her she wasnt clear when she told me about it later that night but she didnt feel comfortable going back in there her feelings were hurt i confronted jack about this and he just brushed it off and quickly changed the subject by telling me to find something to do all of this hate would soon hit a boiling point and thats where the omelette comes in a little over a week ago i was enjoying a night off me and the gf watched some making a murdererironically relevant to the story before both drifting off to sleep i woke up bright and early the next day did some laundry and got some cleaning done while my gf slept in she works two jobs and deserves it i took a shower and prepared to head in to work hopefully making some good tips i walk in minutes early and the managers are all at a table outside of the bar talking they see me walk in and sat me down they told me that the night before someone had served a minor some drinks and it got reported to the police somehow whew it wasnt me i thought i didnt even work that night and i always id people i am unsure of they told me that i need to be sure to always id people and i assured them that i do both jack and nessa walked off to the dining side i talked with courtney a bit and the conversation was a bit odd she said yeah we need to be sure to id people and you probably just assumed he was i cut her off and told her that it wasnt me who worked last night she stuttered back oh i meant kara yeah it was kara who messed up kara who i really loved working with but who was also best friends with jack so you can assume how things were taken care of this would of immediately been my termination if it were me in karas shoes i didnt hold any grudge i was glad she kept her job after the doors were locked that night nessa came up to me and brought up the underage incident again it was odd she spoke kind of loud but not rudely and told me i need to be sure and id people from now on so this doesnt happen again i stood my ground i told her that with all due respect it wasnt me who served the kid she said look i know i am just saying what were they trying to pull here i had the next day off chilling in my apartment all by myself playing hearthstone eating like a pig when my phone buzzes it was a notification telling me that i need to come in to work an hour early because the managers were having a meeting no sweat more hours more money i continue doing my thing the next day i go in an hour early as instructed once again the managers are sitting at a table near the bar they all stare at me as i walk in things didnt seem right jack tells me that he needs to talk to me jack and nessa both sit me down in the dining area jack tells me that he heard that i had a dispute with nessa a few weeks back and he cant have that attitude around here he tells me he is letting me go i was shocked i told him that me and nessa already hashed out our differences and this happened weeks ago i look over at nessa and she shoots me a smirk well now you are talking to your gm about it i felt the marine in me start to come out i was getting angry and about to do something stupid it took everything in me not to throw the table over and punch jack right in the jaw i took a deep breath stood up told them good to go and walked out and courtney was sure to give me a sarcastic byyyeeee as i walked out the door what the hell just happened this was weeks ago and they are firing me for this this cant be right i get to my car and slam my hands down on the steering wheel i was so angry i just wanted to call my girlfriend and hear her tell me everything was going to be alright i grab my phone and find her name in my contacts im thinking to myself how i am going to break the news babe they fired me for no reason jack is such a fucking prick kara served someone underage and nothing came of that but they fire me for something that happened weeks ago i didnt hit the call button i put my phone down it all hit me at once these motherfuckers were trying to burn me for what kara did since it got reported to the police somebody needed to pay and it sure as hell wasnt going to be kara i peeled out as i left the parking lot not because i was angry but because i needed to act fast if i didnt act fast they would get away with murder most the people who join the marines join to fight as crazy as this sounds this is largely why people enlist in the infantry side of marines people like us have a desire to fight and the marines is a great outlet most marines love fighting most of us love conflict we thrive off of it and we know how to react when the cards arent in our favor we are generally some of the nicest and loyal people you will ever meet but you dont fuck with a us marine i open my door and rush to grab my laptop my girlfriend asks me whats wrong and i quickly say nothing babe got fired love you grab my laptop and sit on my recliner she says what i just motion with my hands second as i load up google i find the restaurants corporate website it didnt have a number for corporate but it did have the email address of every single franchise in the company even better i thought to myself so i wrote a long email to a franchise copied and pasted it to every other one i explained in detail about the favoritism that was happening with jack and kara i explained how kara had served someone underage and i had the feelings they were trying to pin it on me i explained how courtney would get manager pay while taking tips as a bartender i explained how nessa would occasionally have me make a drink and she would give it to her teenage daughter who also worked at the restaurant i provided times dates and even showed them the email i sent to our states alcohol control about the underage drinking incidents to ensure my hands were clean i explained how an expensive bottle of jack daniels sinatra seemed to have a leak in it nights after jack had worked every bit of dirt i ever saw or heard about i put in the email and i let every franchise in the company know about it i demanded that i get a call back and i also demanded that i get my termination papers to make sure i wasnt being framed i typed so fast and things just seemed to melt in to place as i made the email my fingers were my weapon you dont fuck with a marine my girlfriend is staring at me the entire time what the hell is going on i finish the email and explain to her the situation she asks me if i am afraid others will get in to trouble i tell her well you know the saying i fill out applications and the same day i get a call from a very well known and popular restaurant they want me to come in for an interview the next day perfect i already have another job i didnt hear from corporate at all that day it was very late in the afternoon so i expected as much the next day i get a phone call early in the morning it is corporate hr that owns the restaurant that i worked at she tells me that they are on their way to the restaurant to investigate my claims she asks me a bunch of questions i am guessing i was being recorded i stayed consistent and honest she tells me all of the things i mentioned in the email were against company policy but the claims would be investigated before any action was taken i asked her if they have access to the camera feed she ensured me that they did thank fucking god for cameras she told me to call back immediately if i could remember anything else that was going on we hung up and i got dressed and headed out the door for my interview at a new potential job well the interview couldnt of gone better i met most of the management at this team and i got such an amazing vibe from them they even want to cross train me as a bartender almost immediately most of the time this place only promotes from within they must have really liked me so i got the job and i am going to try my hardest to be a great employee anyways back to my revenge story i later got word from an insider that they did indeed try and pin the underage incident on me little did they know i am laying in bed that same night drifting off in to sleep listening to sam harriss podcast my girlfriend is sitting up in bed browsing facebook all of the sudden she gasps she startled me because i was almost asleep i jump up and asks her whats wrong she shows me her phone heh wow i said calmly i guess things were worse off there than i thought but damn i didnt expect things to get taken that far well you dont fuck with a marine i thought i got out of bed and made some sweet tea do you feel bad the gf said well babe you know the edit thanks for the gold edit lets not witchhunt people whats done is done and justice has been served no it isnt the restaurant people have been posting pics of edit names have been changed from letters to fake names to make it easier to read
years back my friends bf left her in a load of debt and she bore near all the cost of him moving out and then some as he vindictively racked up credit in her name in a fit of revenge planning at the time she took advantage of the wrong idea with the right offer at the right time and got a credit card in his name thinking she could use it back at him the same way or use it as leverage if he started the same shit up again she was broken into a couple of months ago she was pretty sure it was him and the wheels of justice have been turning slowly regarding that but among the items her ex stole was his own credit card he banged up k on it before confronting her last week about it being his card not hers hes an idiot and just walked into a pit of his own creation hell yeah
i apologize up front for the rather lengthy post but its all true and was my greatest revenge it all starts about years ago i was happily engaged to a girl who i knew for about years but had only been dating for about year lets call her nancy mcfuckingcuntbag all was good she had her dream engagement ring we had a nice house together both had steady jobs and the wedding plans were coming along

her grandmother no answer what about the wedding what about our baby what about everything no answers no contact for three days three days of no breath in my body no clues nothing on day four nancy shows up and starts packing her stuff she wont say a word to me nothing she leaves and sends me an email saying that she cant be with me again no reasons i begin calling her sister and asking what the fuck happened her sister tells me that she has no idea but gives me their moms phone number strange nancy said her mom was out of the picture because she was an abusive alcoholic nevertheless i call mom mom tells me that i am lucky number three who has fallen for this trap nancy cut mom out of her life so mom couldnt ruin nancys game of milking guys for money and resources nancy has been pregnant twice before and had miscarriages and milked guys for everything she could before running off to super christian grandmas house and claiming abuse so grandma will take her in until the dust settles

blaming me for this thats it im going to kill this bitch no wait breathe get your shit together take this bitch apart at the seems a few days of xanax and whiskey get me over the hump of sadness again

sometimes taking the low road heals the soul 
being the only person who can bail someone out is delightful years ago in grad school i was living with my girlfriend her computer had died so she was using my desktop machine to write her thesis she never made backups of any sort ever even though i repeatedly warnedreminded her of the dangers of not backing up she shrugged it off with itll be fine then came the day when i caught her cheating not just flirting with another guy i dont give a fuck about that but walked in on them banging in the apartment later i also discovered chat logs on my computer as well we broke up and because the apartment was on a monthtomonth lease at that point i just walked a week later i get a call from her asking for all the files associated with her thesis you know the ones that were on my computer that she never backed up despite my urging me sure ill be happy to get those to you for her screaming what me oh right those files are incredibly important representing about ten months of work at this point arent they her yes me thatll be then her fuck you me and if you swear at me again the price goes up the price goes up by a day id act fast or itll get pretty expensive its too bad there wasnt some cheap way to have a second copy of those files isnt it oh and itll have to be cash i hung up on her in the end she paid 
sure weve all dealt with idiotic craigslist sellers out there but this woman was too greedy not to have this coming to her i collect vintage road bicycles of which one showed up on our local craigslist for being sold by greedy bicycle lady gbl it is an upperentrylevel road bike by one of the better english manufacturers of the s at best its worth cleaned fixed up and perfect as it is now tops i know a good deal when i see one so i email gbl with my phone number and tell her i can come by within the hour and buy it shortly thereafter i receive this response in my inbox ok so i know realize that the bike is worth more ive upped my price to give me a call if youre interested its not as good a deal as before but its still a bike id like to have in my collection this time i call her to confirm an appointment time i havent been talking to her for seconds before i am informed that the price is now based on the latest inquiry she has had which have been numerous i dont mind a bit of friendly competition but this is ridiculous sure she has a right to getting what the market will offer but deals cannot be made with sellers that cannot stand behind their word i ask if shes willing to stand by this price if i commit to driving halfway across town to pick it up right that minute no lady i doubt youll find anyone willing to put up with this nonsense i could drive across town and find that youve doubled the price by the time i get there good day edit i think it should be noted that im really not interested in the bike anymore at this point vintage roadbikes were unusually common in my city at the time of this story and i knew with time i could put my efforts towards something much nicer and i did with the acquisition of two chrome schwinn paramounts shortly thereafter not to mention that my collection was already quite sizable at the time a fleet of over classic and vintage road and touring bicycles yes i had the nn syndrome quite bad back then but back to the story my last email seemed to end any hope of further discussionbut too many old movies have taught me that the greedy person is the easiest to have fun with especially when spare email addresses are close at hand no longer was it about the bike within minutes g b l had a offer from mr a ready to come by and minutes later mr b just had to have the bike for and thus gbl told mr a that the price was now so mr a confirmed that hed match that offer while mr b dropped out but then mr c pops up will buy now no questions asked and of course gbl will take mr cs offer any day of the week but mr c cant commit to show up until the weekend almost a week later thats fine with her mr a however soon gets an email with the new price mr a can match it but mr a drops off the face of the earth come his appointment time the next day so she tries to get mr c back who confirms for that weekendthen drops off the face of the earth too the day after mr c misses his appointment mr a gets back in touch with our greedy bicycleowning friend who apologies for his family emergency he makes an appointment for the weekend after and mr a misses that appointment too in the meantime mr b wants to know if shell do his as the ad still appears to be up and mr b doesnt show up for his appointment and thus begins a vicious circle of emails from bicycle lady to mr a b and c as she desperately tries to get at least one sucker with more money than brains to her doorstep following three weeks of runaround of course nobody ever replies and by this point no real buyers from craigslist are willing to bother with her nonsense either and so the bike disappears off craigslist but almost exactly a year later gbl posts the bike back up same seller name new pictures nothing done to improve the bikes condition the asking price is a flat thus i emailed her from my original address as myself just to be a pest remember me lady when you want to talk about that price again give me a call maybe youll actually get to sell it this time rimshot
so my work is pretty relaxed about theft we trust each other not to take anything without asking first and that extends to food were all adults and we know better than to steal i only lock my locker so a customer cant wander in and take something not because im worried about my coworkers anyway we had a food thief crop up it was becoming irritating and then a coworker had a brilliant plan she brought an extra sausage biscuit to work and left it on the break room table as if she was going to come back and eat it later however what she didnt tell anyone until later was that she had gotten a bottle of a dog chewing deterrent bitter spray off the sales floor and sprayed the sausage patty with it before wrapping everything back up around an hour later there was a glorious moment when someone on the cleaning crew emerged from the break room coughing and gagging and making the most awful faces that shit is potent and that person is down a job
when i was a guy in my chemistry class in the year above and a bit of a gossiper was telling a bunch of people that id slept with some guy also in the year above it was untrue so when i found out i calmly told him that it wasnt true and that id appreciate it if he stopped saying it to people id heard a few days later that he was still telling people and i was really mad so i thought id start a rumour of my own i had to choose a rumour that was ridiculous but not so ridiculous that noone would spread it but not in a way that would have too negative an effect on his life in the nd last class of the day which almost entirely consisted of people from the year above i said to a few people i sat with hey did you hear that tim fingered a cat that was it the rumour snowballed teenagers love awkward sex stories and this one was just too awkward not to share plus it was so bizarre that most people would know that it wasnt true so noone would call animal protection on him at the end of the day i was walking home with a friend who had heard from loads of the other people in the upper class about this rumour i didnt even tell her it was me so that it couldnt be traced back kids joked about it for the rest of our school days which was only a few months because they upper class graduated after that school year it morphed into tim fingered his grans cat and people would poke him in the stomach singing na na na na na na catman i remember someone shouted it across the social area one day and he exclaimed to a bunch of us i dont even know where this came from and i kept a wry smile on my face i went home last christmas then aged and someone said theyd seen tim catman im glad to hear it stuck

this is my first time posting in this sub and really its the only time ive ever gotten revenge on someone in my life this was all a few years back but about the same time of year looking back i was an easy target for bullies back then but i had never thought that i would be bullied by a girl lets call her beth beth was the type of person that would cut to the front of the lunch line because her time was more important than everyone elses she was the kind of person that would mock you if you got a bad grade she was just an allaround douchebag that felt that the world owed her something and something about me had pissed her off she was a senior and i was a junior and as a result we didnt come in contact very often but whenever she saw my in the hallway or in the one class we shared she would make a point of insulting me knocking my head around or calling me names at my school the period you had gym could change for some people halfway through the year i had overheard that beths gym period was changing and that she would be coming to the bio room during the same period that i was there the bio teacher was a really nice woman who let my friends and i hang out there while she was on her lunch break so there would be no adult in this room and i would be almost alone with beth i knew that since there was no adult around she would take the opportunity to mess with me the next day i went to the bio room early i hid my phone behind a bunch of textbooks on a shelf and turned on the video camera then i sat in a chair where i could be seen by the camera and waited when she came in she started mocking me as i had expected called me a shithead and a social reject asked me why i was in here all alone and said that i had no friends messed up my hair and hit me on the back of my head but i was playing the part of the victim i didnt say a word after she had sufficiently tormented me she logged onto a computer and started doing some work i went over to the shelf and took out a textbook so that i would have an excuse to retrieve my phone i looked at the video that night it made me sad but i knew that i would have the upper hand in the end the only problem was that the audio was shit because the camera was far away so i decided i would do an audio recording the next day i sat in the same seat but i had my phone on the table in front of me with the screen off but the voice recording app activated the audio was much better this time you could clearly hear what she was saying to me now for the revenge i knew that if i went to the principal probably nothing would happen and i wouldnt be allowed to stay in that room at lunch anymore but it just so happened that beth had applied for early admission at a very prestigious very expensive university this college required that if you applied for early admission you must not apply to any other schools it also stated that when you apply for early admission you waive any possibility of getting student aid it was her dream school and her daddy was going to pay for the whole thing pretty much everyone that applies for early admission to this school gets in because the college is making bank off of you so when beth got her acceptance letter she was bragging to everyone that she had gotten into this prestigious university and thats when i decided to call the colleges admissions center i had uploaded the video the audio recording to youtube under a private link i told the admissions officer that beth bullying me on a daily basis and that being around her was a living nightmare i had him view the video and he said he would discuss a course of action with the other admissions officers beth skipped school for days in shame when she came back she was bawling her eyes out to anyone that listened she was devastated nothing had ever gone wrong in her life up to this point certainly nothing this important some people have to learn the hard way in life i never told her that it was me and i dont know what happened to her i hope no one ever has to go through what i went through bullying sucks thanks for listening

this happened a long time ago when i worked on cruise ships we always had dick heads from the internet forum cruise critic this guy had printed a sign i am a cruise critic and put it on his cabin door basically these people expect special service and complain about absolutely everything to get free upgrades drinks or even a free cruise as soon as he got on board he complained about his cabin and was upgraded to a balcony suite to shut him up it still wasnt good enough he kept complaining that his tv reception wasnt crystal clear we visited his cabin and saw no issue with the image in fact it was better than most tvs as it was close to the amplifier for that section after replacing the tv anyway amp explaining that we are tracking a geostationary tv satellite on a moving ship with a gyro stabilised dish and millions of dollars of above and below decks equipment he still kept complaining that the picture wasnt as clear as his tv at home after hours of him complaining and demanding a complimentary cruise he was already cruising for free after complaining so much about his last cruise we planned our revenge when we knew he was at his allocated dining time my av team showed up in the cabin amp gathered a team of engineers fitters and electricians we stripped all of the wall amp roof panels and pulled out all the av wiring dumping a buttload of dust everywhere before downing tools amp calling it a day after the guest amp his wife returned after dinner and a show he called the front desk furious that his cabin had been turned into an uninhabitable construction site it was explained to him that we listened to his demands and as such were rewiring his cabin to ensure he has crystal clear tv reception just like he asked he was advised would take a few days the rest of the cruise as it is a complex job he went quiet before asking to be moved to another cabin he was moved to a cabin smaller than his original cabin and above the bow thrusters he was not heard from again the rest of the cruise edit thanks for all the comments i havent been on reddit for a few days so coming back to this was a surprise i will do my best to reply to some of the comments
edit for all those referring to me as a he think again throwaway for privacy reasons i own a construction equipment dealership specializing in excavation gear the main brand i carry has dealership every blocks to the point that there are over in the lower states alone they do this to keep prices down because dealers have to compete with each other my story starts in business was booming i was making on all new gear and selling it by the truck load i was one of the largest dealers in the us and i was the largest in my region the factory provides us with the machine as well as accessories for it as a dealer we are not allowed to sell non authorized after market accessories if the machine itself is being financed through the factory i had many complaints about the lowering quality in accessories made by the factory to the point that i was no longer comfortable putting my name anywhere near it i asked a friend of mine that deals only in used excavators where he gets all his gear and he introduced me to a factory in china long story short i go visit the supplier and impressed and from that day on only use after market accessories i get around the financing issue by selling all machines with no gear which means no quick couplers buckets or hydraulic thumbs and getting that financed then the customer has to pay cash for the accessories if that is an issue i have a secondary bank that will finance them just not at in addition to a better quality product i now can provide a much better price for example a dig bucket would typically sell for about and we would buy it for ill now sell it for and pay my man in china about this of course helped me get more deals which would have gone to other dealers now instead of being able to call up another dealer and take a machine in on trade if i dont have it i can only get them from the factory meaning instead of needing to hold of inventory i was having to hold about double that at one point i sell a machine in to the heart of another dealers territory non restricted i may add and the customer turns out to be the dealerships owners neighbor this pisses off the other dealership to no end and he finds out where my price advantage is coming from his neighbor tells him that he didnt pay for the accessories separate and he takes this as he financed it all the other dealer turns me in to the factory and implies that ive always used after market gear and that ive always financed it through the factory neither of which are true he made enough waves that the factory sent people out to inventory my lot to make sure i actually had all the machines on my lot that i claim i do and to make sure all the accessories i claim are theirs actually are they audit my sales for the past or years of our business relationship and going through everything with a fine tooth comb the kicker they dont let me use any financing they offer while theyre searching for a non existant errorscam on my part after about months of having or men going through all of our paperwork inspecting every signature and calling over different customers i get the green light to keep selling and they leave unfortunately this turns what should have been the height of the season in to one of the worst quarters ive ever had tldr i get an advantage and another dealer tattle tails and messes with my livelihood time for the revenge in our as you may be aware the world ended dealers were getting ready to close down i went from making on the new machines to making and i went from over doubling my money on each accessory to selling them at over cost im proud to say i didnt lose a single penny during this i eventually had to cut back my sales staff but we never lost a cent anyway dealers were trying to get rid of their inventory because they didnt want to have to pay for it when the flooring expired well flooring started expiring and the dealers didnt have networks in place to be able to sell them far enough or suppliers in place to sell them cheep enough so they were getting stuck at this point i was selling everything cheep but was still selling it and still making at least a sale so i didnt run out of flooring on a single item once a dealer ran out of flooring and couldnt pay for their gear the factory would be responsible for trucking it back to their distribution centers and then they would be stuck with all the gear i struck a deal with the factory and the short version is the other dealers were now getting free extended flooring and werent paying for their machines if i needed it or could sell it they would pay my shipping expense so i could sell it the other dealers were mostly fine with this because i was freeing them of hundreds of thousands of debt every month well most dealers loved this out of the or so dealers in my area i would only take trades from of them thats right i stuck the dealer that turned me in with every single item he had he tried to get me to take them literally offering my thousands of dollars to do so so he wouldnt have to either pay the factory or lose his contract with them well it came to the point that our state had about worth of inventory on hand across all dealers guess what nearly half of that was all on dealer and his inability to sell them and inability to pay for them cost him his contract with the factory and his dealership as a hole once the started turning around i had the chance to actually buy his location building land shop etc but turned it down another dealership did buy it and actually hired him on as a manager after a few months though he got fired as he just couldnt close a deal anymore true tldr fuck with me and take food off of my table ill destroy the business that youve ran for decades that was founded by your father edit sorry if this is a bit hard to read it took a few drinks to be able to feel privat enough to post this and its pretty late where i am right now ill answer any questions in the comments if it was a little confusing
this is my first post in prorevenge i say that more for my own records than anything but i feel its a good opener nice and neutral this story starts off with me sir pahnkayx of the breakfasttable moving out of an emergency apartment and into slumlords offered domicile i found the apartment on craigslist the rent was pricey but the accomodations looked really nice the building was old she was built in a late th century beaux arts style architecture typical of former banking towns in massachusetts she was also conveniently located next to the only regional hospital thus ensuring id have ambulances going past several times an hour sirens and lights like it was the end of days i now know never to rent conveniently near a hospital i was very satisfied with the initial walkthrough the apartment had high ceilings wood floors and framed doorways it was all very nice superficially i was hooked i also was in dire straits with my thenroommate who was going through some sort of weird relationship induced psychosis all in all having this fall in my lap as it did seemed awesome i had a place a top floor of a walk up but who cares i could afford it etc then the trouble starts the buildings electrical is from none of the outlets are grounded that means two prong holes instead of the normal three like we use in the st century there is also a premium on these outlets as there is only one outlet in each of the rooms including the bathroom and kitchen this is a huge deal because i work from home and the computer and towers draws a lot of electricity for my work more than the bullshit geriatric illegal wiring could handle their costcutting measures were cutting into my earnings on top of it all the fusebox was actually a tubesandscrews number fuck tubesandscrews the rent was dollars for an apartment fitted for wilson era warpolicies i start submitting complaints the breaker box was in the basement behind a locked door only the management could get to because the whole apartment building was run through one breaker box for those who know electrical youll see where this is going this was a huge problem in summer you had the option of television or fan winter computer or spaceheater if you felt adventurous you could plug something else in or turn on a light but then the whole apartment would be plunged into darkness and youd have to wait for hours and hours until it was convenient for one of those stooges to come over and reset the breaker box in the basement then they had the audacity to charge you money for the service the complaints continue they start getting surly they start getting aggressive they start showing up on the first of the month to collect in person with the maintenance guys as back up they start sending me threatening letters accusing me of all sorts of insanity because i had the brass balls to call them on their scam this went on for several months before i was stranded over a weekend with no electrical that was the breaking point i called an electrician to come and look at my house he tested the outlets everything he wasnt impressed but this was the start he told me this was basically a fire trap this was especailly worrying as i lived on the rth floor of a walkup i then called the fire department who directed me to the health department the health department came over and did a walk through he wrote up a work order for the city wiring inspector the wiring inspector came over took one look at my fuse box and wrote a work order for a replacement breaker box this means the fuse box needs to be torn out replaced with a breaker box the breaker line needs to be installed in this case that meant drilling through floors and laying the line since it didnt exist an expense of several several thousand dollars i had a breaker box but its not over the wiring inspector was so appalled by what he saw he requested to see the rest of the building turns out that the whole building is way the fuck out of code and every single apartment needs to be renovated at the cost of a couple hundred grand i then used this and sued for back rent i got the whole year of my time there free since the place was so out of code and slumlord still had to repair the building on his own dime tldr they didnt deal with me so they dealt with the state i won though edit after reading through some of the comments ive found i wasnt completely clear no i do not live there anymore edit ii i got about dollars in back rent which is equal to about of my rent a month but then the courts also voided the rent i payed him for my time there so it was a year usd so at the end of the day the went back to my lawyer basically and i got the year for free edit iii yes i got payed fuck
about a year ago i finally decided to get out on my own for good and true because living with other people causes me unending stress but the only way to get into a place quickly was to take a unit on the edge of the notsonice district of town i figured since there was a police station literally across the road i would be safe needless to say i dont live there any more at first everything seemed fine i got all my stuff moved in started learning how to cook stuff more complicated than chicken soup it was all good most everyone in my row of units tended to keep themselves to themselves apart from my neighbour on one side having noisy shower sex at two in the morning everyone left me alone except this one dude he was in the unit on the other side from the shower sex people and he was in retrospect way too enthusiastic to have a single lady moving in next door he was constantly coming over just to say hi and see how i was settling in and often had to be physically pushed out the door he often stank of booze and took advantage of the summer weather and sealed windows no shit this place had locked windows and tenants didnt get keys to them to come wandering in when i was working he drove me nuts but seemed relatively harmless the first sign that something wronger than the guy being completely unable to get the message to fuck off and leave me alone was when the cops came around to try and serve a warrant on him i dont know exactly what came of that but he swore blind theyd actually been after the previous tenant and he hadnt come out because he was sleeping which in retrospect i was a fucking idiot for believing because i am a heavy sleeper and they woke me up then he asked if he could use my computer to check his email because his was in the shop i let him because it got him to shut up and let me work faster i didnt think much of this until one night when he and the guy from the unit on the other side of him got a bit drunk and came over asking to watch top gear the other guy was very nice and friendly even drunk but he got louder and more and more raucous until he crossed the line and made some jokes about raping the other guy i told him not to make those jokes and to get out and while he was leaving i heard the words im not fucking joking ill rape him if he doesnt shut the fuck up next day i spoke to the other dude and found out his computer had been confiscated by the police the neighbour then promptly disappeared for a month and i had the real estate agents asking me if i had any idea where hed gone and why he wasnt paying rent he then promptly reappeared paid his owing rent and went around boasting that hed had so many parking tickets theyd arrested him i dont know much about the law but i know you dont get a month in jail here for tickets i still would have let it pass except i came down with the gastric flu and was very very very sick for a week and every time the neighbour turned up i had to tell him to go away this week was also the week a tornado hit upstate and the heavy winds caused a lot of property damage all over our city and between the noise and the flu i didnt get more then about ten minutes sleep for the entire week the neighbour turned up at pm one night demanding to let me in and in my miserable sick sleepdeprived state i told him to fuck right off the next day the seat and tyres of my motorcycle were cut to ribbons even though the police and i both knew damn well who did it without any physical evidence or a witness they couldnt actually do anything revenge was now going to be mine first i let neighbour use my computer again he had a habit of not signing out of his email so instead of doing what i usually did and signing out for him i left him logged in and called an old school friend said school friend is now a cop i explained the situation to him and as soon as i named names he told me to stay logged in and hed be right over two hours later my computer was being examined by a police department technician who downloaded pretty much everything the guy had ever written to anyone i didnt see much but what i did see was fucking sick i then gave statements to a few officers and found out that when neighbour was in jail for parking tickets he was actually in trouble for drugging and trying to sexually assault a girl in a local bar and had only gotten out because his mum had posted bail despite him being a registered sex offender the prison hed been in didnt even have a low security wing hed obviously lied to the real estate agents about what was actually going on because any criminal record beyond parking or speeding tickets made them reject you for rental neighbour was arrested again for something theyd wanted to pin on him but hadnt been able to until they got the emails i got subpoaenaed as a witness and he got carted off to await trial and then just to add insult to injury my policeman friend called the real estate agents about his record and he got evicted i saw him in court last week when i gave my testimony and he lost his shit when he realised i was the one whod finally gotten the police the evidence they needed to send him down i then got the glorious pleasure of hearing him sentenced to ten years tldr criminal neighbour knifes my motorbike when i wont let him visit at pm i give police access to his email and he gets arrested and loses everything edit i ran into the lawyer who was prosecuting the case just now at the shops looks like the jerks getting deported back to his home country to serve his term there hah thats fucking beautiful edit the prosecutor didnt tell me where hes being deported to because its actually against the law for him to reveal most case details however judging by the soontobeflyingthefuckouttahere bastards accent hes gonna be freezing his bollocks off somewhere germanic ouch
apologies in advance for length in my senior year of college only a year ago i was required to take a diversity class for my major i wasnt interested in jewish studies asian literature or anything else that they offered my girlfriend had taken a sociology class which qualified called socy sociology of gender she said it was really interesting and not at all what a stereotypical womans studies class might be like so i thought what the heck ill give it a shot unfortunately the thought provoking discussion instigating professor that she had was not the same one that i would be having unbeknowst to me there were two different professors and i was in the section with the awful one this professor had an agenda and made damn sure that anyone in her class would have to agree or get out any dissent was quashed over the course of the semester it was very clear that despite the class being about a very thought provoking subject in which there are many different theories and ideas to her there was a right answer and a wrong answer to every question that may come up i love playing devils advocate so whenever there is a flaw in someones argument even if i agree with the argument ill speak up and try to get whoever is making the argument prove their point i was a criminal justice major beyond a reasonable doubt was my standard to get me to agree with you one way or another so we butted heads a lot it came to a head when we read chapters from the myth of the vaginal orgasm by anna koedt a classic feminist novel in which she among other things claims that woman are indoctrinated into thinking that sex is penetrative sex is pleasurable when in fact it doesnt do anything for them and cant feel any stimulation when penetrated when i read this i laughed out loud it just sounds like such bullshit that i couldnt believe we were taking it seriously the author does make some good points in the book such as debunking some freudian craziness but that notion was laughable to me when it came time to discuss it in class i brought this up as total bs i wish i had written it down at the time because the back and forth was pure gold i raised the point that another of our readings raised the point that some woman can and some woman cant orgasm from pure vaginal stimulation koedt might have been one who couldnt and since she was a sociologist not a researcher her views may have been skewed along those lines my professor was arguing that koedt was right and we had been assigned the other reading a study by alfred kinsey an early sex researcher to prove that these other woman had adopted the ideology of the patriarchal society if that was the case i said how can my girlfriend of years have an orgasm when we have sex and her clit isnt being stimulated obviously it was because she had adopted the ideology as well so that you could continue to have sex with her so she was faking it yes even though i know she wasnt she was lying to preserve your ego so disregarding the fact that she had just called my girlfriend a liar i brought up the point that lesbians use dildos on each other for sex as well if they couldnt feel pleasure from that then what was the point and on that note apparently i was going too far down the smut train though she was perfectly happy talking about sex before and she changed the subject i think making a well thought out argument against her personal beliefs made me a marked man in her book and she was determined to see me fail no matter what luckily in this class we only had three grades the whole year a midterm of the grade a final of the grade and a final paper the two tests were both multiple choice and she couldnt skew my grade on them one way or the other i did ok on them a c and a b and just needed a on the final paper to pass the class the papers prompt was very open ended basically any kind of gender studies research paper so i decided to poke the bear not the best idea on my part but i decided to create a survey asking girls if they could have a vaginal orgasm along with some other questions about sexuality and feminist sexuality theory from the research i concluded that koedt was wrong the kinsey experiment we read was outdated and wrong and that females could in fact have a vaginal orgasm alert the media call a news conference i had constructed my survey and distributed in a very statistically significant way and had mounds of prior research to support my claims despite all of this my professor gave me a on the paper on the basis that my survey had a bias the research was insignificant and my conclusions were improper for the data collected she wouldnt budge despite another professor who i had asked for help in constructing the survey speaking on my behalf so the grade stayed and i failed the class luckily in my university there was a process to appeal a final grade what happens is that the original paper or test is submitted to a panel of other professors in the department and they all grade it separately and if the new average is very different from the original than it can be changed the comments are also submitted along with testimony from myself anyone i want to have there and the professor and anyone she wants to have there so the board found that my paper was very well structured and i had effectively countered koedts claims they also agreed with my conclusion that the other study we looked at was outdated they were sociology professors too and knew all about the subject so after the professor who i had helping me talked to them and i talked to them my professor talked to them the grade was changed i got an a on the final and a b in the class thank god no more gender studies for me the next semester before i was going to graduate i went to see the professor who had helped me he had written a great recommendation for grad school and i had gotten into my first choice and went to thank him in the course of our discussion i brought up the other professor who we had shut down and he gave me some great news because the board had felt she graded me extremely unfairly and on the basis of her own personal beliefs they submitted the case to the dean of the college of behavioral sciences it was not the first time that she had had complaints against her and now with this hard evidence along with the findings of the other professors she was fired i had a big problem with her because academics should be unbiased and discussion is healthy the my way or the highway attitude is really bad especially for the gray area of gender studies so while getting someone fired isnt really something to celebrate i was glad that no more students would be subjected to her bullshit 
the happy years ago i used to be married to shewhomustnotbenamedinmyfamily for the purposes of brevity we shall call her alice somewhat significant age gap when we got married i was and alice was at the time we had our share of ups and downs and during one particularly hard time about a year after we got married we were sunk in credit card debt and had to move in with her mother who had a whole bunch of chronic medical problems and no insurance stepdad is a shadetree mechanic who was not bad at it actually but couldnt get regular work because he had medical problems all his own move in cut some costs help family its the right thing to do right problem was alice and i couldnt seem to both hold jobs at the same time she would get laid off a week before i would start a new job and viceversa after about months of this i was like fuck it imma get all the jobs i get a job working weeknights i get a weekend job the temp service i signed up with was really aggressive and got me decent weekday jobs on a regular basis only problem was these jobs were over an hour away from her moms and id be so dead tired from working id crash at my brothers place which was minutes away the next city over id only be able to go home to see alice every few days then have to get up a few hours later so i could beat the rush hour in to work four months pass and we find ourselves slowly inching from the red into the black one day alice lets me know that she got a job its about minutes away and only i have a working car she has friends that can give her a ride when im not home and i take her to work or pick her up every chance i get this goes on for about a month finally she says i think i need my own car its all good shes an independent girl and i can see how hard it is for her to be so dependent on other people i do some quick math and figure it would take about four months for us to get enough money together to get a decent beater that wont die in a year she nods her understanding i see her disappointment and my manpride cannot take it i level up and go beast mode i start taking side jobs mostly construction with a friend of a friend who pays on a perday basis to fill out the times when i have blanks on weekdays when the temp agency hasnt got anything for me and i pull double shifts for the weekend job i sleep an average of four or five hours a day three weeks later i have purchased a car for her a cute little x that i saw on craigslist mechanically sound but was dirty af i park it at a friends place and over the course of a week give that grimy bastard the most comprehensive cleaning of its life you could have eaten off the wheel wells i shit you not my good buddy nathan springs for some cheap but nice visuals wheel paint seat covers floor mats etc and we make it look even better when we move it out of the garage my friends mom swears it cant be the same car and i have to prove it to her i leave my car with nathan and drive home in her car timing is perfect im about minutes away from home when alice calls me on my cell she wants to go get some groceries i let her know ill be there in a bit and park by the curb one house down i knock on the door and tell her to come out so we can go she steps out and looks around wheres your car left it at nathans what did you drive that i point at the car whose car is that yours she takes a couple of seconds to process that single word then her jaw drops and alice runs back inside screaming mom insanern got me a car the sad a couple of years go by alice has learned how to use a manual transmission because her baby has one between myself and her stepdad alice has learned to change the oil herself and even took an active part in replacing the brake pads and all four shock absorbers on her baby she bathes her baby herself she has learned to take care of her baby mils medical problems are mostly manageable with meds now and stepdad is getting almost regular work thrown his way by friends and previous customers we have moved out of her moms place and im only working two jobs now credit card debt is down by alice also has a steady job and is thinking of going back to school and then i find out she is cheating on fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me there is no third time there must be payback my manpride demands it the mad a week after the nuke drops on our marriage ive worked out the problem shes already gotten her stuff and moved out by then i call her up to meet lunchtime her work just to talk i say theres a little pseudoecoindustrial picnic area right by the building she works at and theres a fair amount of foot traffic ie witnesses theres some chitchat and she makes a vague appeal to work things out by dragging my dead dad into it hellz naw you dont have the right to do that you had a one percent chance but that just flat out dropped it to zero i cut her off midsentence im taking the car your car wut the pink slip is in my name im taking back my property right now and if you dont hand over the keys right now im going to report it stolen to the police but you gave that car to me id been talking in a normal conversational tone up until this time her betrayal rams into my chest for the thousandth time my voice hardens i didnt give the car to you i gave the car to my wife her brain still isnt firing on all cylinders she asks bbut how will i get to work get your boyfriend to drive you im still looking at her her face goes slack as she realizes that i am not kidding i take the keys get into the her baby and drive off i look at her as we pass she

cathartic this is the best ive felt in over a decade pps car stuck around for another year before i sold it to my buddy nathan i only wanted for it and he wanted to pay blue book we compromised i sold it for the same price i bought it which was way cheaper than blue book ppps thanks for the gold anonymous redditor edit as suggested did some name changing to make it flow better also not their real names theres always that one person 
a little back story first my older brother adopted me when i was i lived with him his wife and her two children one a couple months older than me the other a year older i have never gotten along with the younger one his mother and father went through a divorce and both parents spoiled the hell out of him his father owned several businesses making around a million a year so hes your typical entitled douchebag who has always clashed with me someone who grew up poor this is the type of dude that kicked a dog we all raised from a week old puppy because she was excited to see him after not seeing him for six months and she was jumping around hes the type of dude that has ruined thanksgiving because the milk was instead of by screaming yelling and cussing everyone out at the age of now on to the story i was on a phone plan with his mother but i lost my job unable to pay the last i owe her but we had worked it out that i would pay her back on thanksgiving by installing a stereo my brothers her husbands new pickup a little over a week ago i was picking up fallout for a friend who was at work at the gamestop in the local mall nephew works across the little walkway and saw me walk in from outside where he was walking in to work while im in line he comes in cuts in front of everyone and cusses me out saying i shouldnt be buying games when i owe his mom money i told him he needed to back the hell off and not talk about shit he knew nothing about he kept going on and on running his mouth i got my friends game and walked out with him following me out the door when i got to the door he stopped ranting and went back to work with a smug look on his face i lived with this guy for years so i know him very well when i hopped in my car i realized he had parked in front of me and my dash cam was on he sells weed out of his truck to subsidize his low wages at the mall and i remembered that he always showed up to work early to so i rewound my dash cam and sure enough you could clearly see him sell weed i sent an email with the video of him selling the weed to the management of the mall from a new email address as a concerned citizen three days later while talking to my brother he told me that my nephew got fired from his job and banned from the mall property my response that sucks enjoy not getting that unemployment check asshole 
edit just a bit of a preface besides the landlord trying to underpay me he also sent me emails prior to the court date saying that i have no chance of winning and should settle for under of the total cost claims he has never lost in court waited in the court lobby for nearly two hours landlord sat closeish to me and kept trying to make stupid bantersmall talk with me i ignored him completely finally get pulled into the court room after the office was supposed to have closed about pm the judge asks if there is anything she can do to help us reach an amicable settlement without having to go through the judicial process i explain that i attempted that before any court proceedings and landlord would not accept my offer his counteroffer was unreasonably low unfortunately we have to do the thing we are sworn in judge asks for a copy of the lease she reads off the monthly rent amount then the security deposit amount asks me when i sent it to landlord originally i tell her around july th landlord confirms to her that he received it judge asks landlord what he did with the security deposit i deposited it he says judge explains that she needs details what financial institution type of account etc i just deposited it into my wells fargo or whatever he said account judge lets out an audible sigh mr tenant where you told what financial institution this was deposited in i explain that i was never informed another audible sigh judge asks if she can speak with each of us separately we agree landlord goes first about ten minutes later they return and i go with the judge im ready to explain all of the claims he made as to why he was keeping the money show her all of the evidence ive documented and brought with me brought folders each with their own copies of various things judge closes the door to her office and explains that he is going to give me the entirety of the deposit she explains that since he never disclosed the location of the deposit or put it in an interest bearing account he essentially had no case she explains that the pennsylvania landlordtenant act of is very specific and the landlord has a lot of things he needs to follow i ask if that means he will also be paying for the court fees about she tells me that i can request that but since this will technically be a settlement she was being nice and not putting in a judgment against him but he still had to pay the full amount she didnt ask him about that i suggest that he pay half as a sign of good faith and also i wanted this shit to be done with she thinks this is very reasonable we go back into the court room and she explains that landlord has agreed to pay the full amount and also informs him that he will be paying half of the court fees the judge asks how long id like to give him she suggests business days i offer a full week because im way too fucking nice landlord offers to write the check right then and there he does i receive the check and i return to him the uncashed check he originally tried to return me less than of the initial deposit in my final moments of glory the judge again suggests to landlord that he read up on the pennsylvania landlordtenant act of as being a landlord isnt something you should halfass i pipe up and explain to him that i had already done him the favor and pull out the entire agreement which i had already printed up and highlighted the relevant sections i tell him he can keep it as ive already read it the judge says we are free to go today was a good day
while reading the this morning about how cheating is rampant in india it brought back a memory of my time in college our story begins in a little school called sunyit in upstate new york about years ago state run school that they tried to peddle as an institute of technology this was a school that only had wireless in one building out of six had it equipment from as far back as according to the datestamps and professors who were uncaring parttimers or in my case senile i was in what was called an experimental course which meant it would count towards my degree but would be nontransferable we were required to take at least four of these classes over the course of our attendance in order to graduate it was bullshit but that was the rule one of these classes was run by an elderly professor who was known for being intolerable unrelenting and literally a relic of the past he constantly claimed he invented token ring and how it was superior to ethernet in almost every way every exam had a token ring related question and the only way to get a perfect score on that question was to preform academic fellatio and proclaim that token ring was superior in that scenario because whatever very if you get me now the class itself was a mix of foreign graduate students from india and undergrad students from new york we were typically assigned group work and the six of us from ny would work together turn in our papers the usual and the graduate students would do the same for the final project the professor decided that the undergraduates could learn better if they worked at the graduate level so the normal teams were split up and i was put on a team of all indian graduate students we were given weeks to invent a product and apply previous course work and knowledge into making the product more technological an example would be a lawnmower that you could control via a cell phone we could simply say it was a lawnmower but wed have to explain in detail the protocols used over the network encryption error control how it would handle signal degradation etc very challenging and yet a great way to show off what ive learned so far furthermore wed all have to grade each other in evaluation forms and get the other teammates to sign off on it so if you wanted to give someone a c youd have to explain to them why you graded them that way i was not a fan of this as i felt it was the professors job to grade us not our fellow students he was outsourcing his duties but the chair of the department was new and didnt want to mess with a tenured teacher this was the hand i was dealt the first meeting my team had was lacking to say the least the graduate students contributed nothing one of them worked on a paper from another class and the other two were just chatterbugs any idea i had they instantly approved of felt good the first few times but as time went on it became apparent i was the only one doing the work this pattern continued into week two and three and i finally said i couldnt make it anymore due to scheduling conflicts and wed collaborate online via email of course the grad students thought this was a great idea and we didnt meet in person again except in class as dictated by the professor by week four i had done what i felt was my part of the work id written eight pages of content describing how the product would work its practical purposes how itd communicate over rfid etc the only thing i couldnt get my head wrapped around was the high level stuff like error correction signal drift and that sort of thing math was never my strong point but the grad students said it would be no problem i thanked them told them exactly what needed to be done and even highlighted the important parts of the paper for them at most theyd have to write one page each to supplement my eight they were getting a pretty sweet deal and i was going to get to graduate win win i thought week five comes around and im expecting the email with the completed paper there wasnt a whole lot of email traffic none to be exact for the past week in send out an email asking for a status update since the paper is due next week and well all fail if we miss the deadline the final paper represents of the final grade i get an email days before deadline that we all need to meet in the library to finish the paper and theyve been really busy with other coursework at this point im more nervous than angry as my ass is on the line and cant afford to fail a class and miss graduation we decide on a time reserve a room and meet they had literally nothing to show for the past five weeks i know people on reddit exaggerate the word literally a lot but i cant overemphasize this enough nothing i explained the situation we were all in and how wed all fail if we blew this but they were cocky and sure that hed never fail them and theyve had him before etc etc etc excuses they wanted me to bet my degree on excuses and falsehope that was backed by nothing after the meeting i went to meet with the professor at this point im more scared than anything else too scared to be angry but it was still there and incredibly nervous that the old man wasnt going to budge sure enough he didnt i explained my case showed him all the work i did described every aspect of the project to him verbally to prove i made a full and honest attempt to get this done but my teammates were holding me back of the time he didnt even look at me just kept repeating that this is what the real work world is like and this sort of thing will happen in real life and i need to find a way through it and all other sorts of useless guidance in effect i wasted at least an hour of my life in his office the dept chair had an office in the same hallway a few doors down having no other options i just sat down in the hallway against the door waiting for him people would pass by and look at me some would smile most didnt a college student sitting against an office door in a hallway reeks of desperation and hopelessness which sums up the entire college very nicely in retrospect after what feels like forever the department chair arrives lets me in and says i have min before he has an appointment downstairs so make it brief i gathered my thoughts and made the same case i made to the professor how i was being sabotaged by my teammates and the professor refused to hear me out at one point i challenged the chair about why im not going to be graded on my merits and knowledge but rather who i was associated with involuntarily to begin with finally he had to dismiss me from his office to get to his meeting but told me hed look into this and shook my hand no commitments no promises just a handshake deadline the different teams present their products and the professor does his interrogations in a way that makes the trolls of reddit seem like enlightened scholars he used his years of experience to effectively shoot down everyone on every team in any area they felt they adequately covered hypothetical situations and impossibilities of costs and scale that turned what was at first a fun project of theorycrafting with field specific knowledge into what can only be described as technical draft reading in front of a man firing squad then the dreaded moment arrives when my team has to present we get to the front of the class and know whats coming our way my seated classmates all had the look of exhaustion and defeat on their faces and i knew id soon be one of them at this school you got used to being beaten to give you all the scene im a skinny white kid next to four tall indians who each had at least lbs on me so im the runt of the litter up there i pull out my pages and start reading dont even get off the first page before the professor starts poking holes in individual statements i politely asked him to hold all questions until the end so i wouldnt lose my place on the paper and because i hoped hed forget most of them by the end which he agreed to and smiled then he walked up to his desk got a pad of paper and a pen sat back down and told me to continue i smiled at him because its all i could do in that moment of defeat instead of taking small beatings along the way i was gonna get fucking destroyed by a barrage at the end jumping out the window looked like a good option at this point second floor so id live and probably be able to hobble off with a sprain by the time i got to the end of page eight he was on page three my classmates had looks of fear and shock when they saw him turning over page after page to jot down notes and questions for an old bastard he was meticulous ill give him that so i get to the end and i ask him if he had any questions hed like to ask the group at this point i was the only one who had said a word so it was high fucking time my other teammates chimed in to help his questions were just as sharp and pointed as the ones he asked other teams very advanced and frankly beyond my level after hed read a question id call out one of the others and say thats an intriguing point you made sir ill let teammate explain that part of the product and hope itll answer your question i handed my pages to the teammate and let fate take its course now weve all come across people who think theyre great at bullshitting but really arent you let them dig a hole for a while then fill it in with them at the bottom the professor did exactly that he set them up gave them a length then yanked the leash back and called them out on their misunderstanding of the topic or the product or the part of the course that explained it each question i directed to another teammate one after another number three tried to pass but that just angered the professor which made him even worse he started calling out those four graduate students asking them to describe certain parts of the product which is what he was writing down on his pad of paper the entire time not just questions number four tried defensive answers and stalling tactics which again just angered the professor at the end he threw us out of the class ill never forget that he went on a min tirade of how we treated our final project like a joke it was the worst presentation hed ever seen in his history at the school and how we should all be ashamed of ourselves if this was our best effort i was already sweating bullets from fear and anxiety and after that speech i was glad to be the first one out the door skipped my other classes went back to the dorm locked myself in my room and went to bed at pm didnt know what else to do and i was mentally exhausted that kind of exhausted where your brain just goes into shutdown because you cant figure a way out of a mess that you shouldnt have been in in the first place didnt leave the dorm the next day nor eat for the hrs didnt even want to drink as i knew thatd make the depression worse id have plenty of time for drinking after telling my parents i wasnt graduating two days after the presentation i got an email from the professor asking for a meeting in room where room was the chairs office i accepted and arrived min early with both the professor and the chair already inside we started early and got right to the point with the professor looking right at me and asking what happened here as he pointed to my eightpage report on the desk i explained it as best i could the product the function the technology used and then he stopped me he didnt care about that he wanted to know why i was the only one on the team who had an idea of what the presentation was about the chair asked if i had bothered working with my teammates at all since they apparently seemed clueless about what i was presenting about naturally i denied the claim opening my sent emails folder on my laptop to show all the times i reached out to them and how infrequently they replied i told him about the inperson meetings in the beginning and how i only found out two days before the deadline that they werent doing anything to contribute i gently reminded them both that i was in their offices as soon as i found out where this was all heading but i admitted that i should have kept a better track of their progress i learned a long time ago that a little humility and admitting your own faults no matter how small goes a long way the chair let out a huff of air through his nose and gave a look to my professor i couldnt tell if it was contempt or not but it made me feel slightly more at ease the last question i got asked was if the packet of papers was all my original work did you write this all of this solo to which i replied that i had except the one paragraph that i did a direct quote but cited properly at the bottom of the page grades got posted the next week for all my classes i did decent but knew i was fucked because the class the grade posted though was a b i refreshed the page several times to make sure it wasnt a formatting problem with the site a common problem back then but the grade held i stopped by the professors office later that day after one of other classes and asked why i got that grade i explained that i had legitimately thought i had failed based on the final project apparently the chair suggested that my team not be graded according to the previously mentioned system and be given grades directly from the professor as is normal in every other class my part of the work while lacking in several areas was acceptable for an undergraduate student he admitted in plain english that he treats undergrads with more aggression because the world is not a nice place and its better you learn that lesson here where you can get back up after a fall i told him i appreciated the hard lesson but there might be better ways of going about it he didnt care and i wasnt surprised he didnt either turns out that i was not the only one they met with in the office the graduate students were called in one at a time and were required to bring their parts of the project to the meeting they all plagiarized they were either too stupid or too lazy to even try and hide it the chair ran their papers though one of those plagiarism detection programs and they all came back with certainty one of them ill never know who copied straight from wikipedia verbatim graduate students he repeated his claim that it was one of the worst presentations hed ever seen and how it was shameful but this time around i knew he was referring to the graduate students and not me at the end of the meeting i shook his hand not as a courtesy but out of respect his teaching style was unorthodox but damned if it wasnt effective ill never forget the lessons learned from that class and i dont mean the coursework as for the graduate students failed each of them and more that werent in my group it was a miniscandal sort of thing on campus everyone in the major heard about it and it was the talk of the dining hall for a couple of days because of the grades and the plagiarism hit on their record they all lost their student visas while i cant be sure they were deported the plagiarism charge means they cant come back to the school and no other schools will touch them for at least a couple semesters they cant get a job in the country without a valid visa either so it effectively ended them my degree hangs above my desk at home and reminds me of those hard lessons learned tldr this is a story about a grouchy senior citizen indians myself a chair and a whole lot of fear also one of the hardest lessons ive ever learned no not in that way 
copied from wikipedia charlie wilson entered politics as a teenager by running a campaign against his nextdoor neighbor city council incumbent charles hazard when thirteen years old wilsons fourteenyearold dog entered hazards yard hazard retaliated by mixing crushed glass into the dogs food causing fatal internal bleeding following this incident wilson obtained a drivers permit and drove ninetysix voters primarily black citizens from poor neighborhoods to the polls in his familys twodoor chevrolet as patrons left the car wilson told each of them that he didnt want to influence their vote but that the incumbent hazard had purposely killed his dog after hazard was defeated by a margin of votes wilson went to his house to tell him he shouldnt poison any more dogs wilson cited this as the day he fell in love with america
this little incident happened over the course of the past few months a little background my husband and i moved to a new place and didnt know anyone there hes really outgoing and his new job was filled with people around his age so he made friends easily on the other hand im pretty quiet and all my coworkers are at least years older than me and im not into going out thing unlike a lot of people my age mids so i ended up joining a friendfinding website to meet people that way also ive always had more guy friends than girl friends because i connect with them better growing up with brothers and no sisters will do that to you so anyway i start talking to this guy named john on the website and he seems really cool as i always do when first chatting with soemone on the site i told him off the bat that i have a husband in addition to it being in the main area of my profile he said that he totally understood and i believed him we eventually exchanged numbers and began to text and make plans to meet up for the first time before that happened though he started to change he began to try and flirt with me insinuate that he thought i was attractive etc i reminded him that i was being serious about not looking for anything romantic for a few days he went back to normal the night before we were set to meet he sent me a dick pic which was a really unforunately looking dick and said please reconsider your husband doesnt need to know at that point i wrote back saying im not interested and i dont want to meet with you within seconds i get a text back saying what is wrong with you followed by a blank text that just says stagefright detected thankfully not only is my phone patched but the texting app i use wont let the video play i replied and told him to leave me alone not mentioning the stagefright message at all a few days passed and i heard nothing from him then out of the blue i get a text from john that says please give me another chance it was hard for me to believe you wouldnt even consider me i told him that it was hard for me to believe that someone would be so malicious as to try and stagefright my phone all over a rejection he said sorry my pride made me angry at that point i knew i could enact my revenge although i only knew his first name i was easily able to find him on facebook through his phone number giving me his last name from there i was able to find everything elsetwitter instagram etc i took screenshots of everything including his incriminating admission of attempting to attack my phone heres where the revenge comes in he had previously told me that he had gotten into the school of his dreams to study a certain subject not taught at many other placesi figured that this college would be interested to hear that one of their soontobe students was engaging in malicious and potentially illegal activity in their free time so i rang them up i left messages for multiple offices any i could think of that would relate to him the following week i got a call back from the office of the dean of his program they asked that i forward everything i had to them which i did then i didnt hear anything for a few weeks and figured that was the end of ituntil i got a call from the dean herself she told me that the school took my story very seriously and had decided to withdraw their acceptance of john she said that she was happy that i came forward with what he had done because they didnt want someone whose behaviour would reflect poorly on their program i thanked her for getting back to me i immediately checked his twitter account yep sure enough he had made a series of depressed tweets about how his dream had been stolen from him he didnt know what to do now etc i know that there are way harsher revenge stories out there but im pretty proud of what i did to that asshole

this happened a year or so ago when my friend was driving another friend and i around town on a typical day or whatever we had just gotten a fuck ton of fast food from the drivethru because were stoners and we were stopped in the left turn lane of an intersection when some dickhead in a blacked out navigator or aviator suv nailed the side of my friends car with an egg while making a right turn at that intersection i didnt think much of it because i was sitting on the left side and i wasnt paying much attention to detail but my friend wasnt having it he instantly peels out of the left turn lane and to the right where the suv had taken off the driver of the suv obviously made a huge mistake thinking he could get away with this because he pulls up to the next intersections left turn lane giving my friend the golden opportunity to equal punishment in an equal manner as my friend is making his move and he wields his fresh milk shake with his right hand he suddenly notices the passenger window open the driver glances over to the right and even before his eyes had a chance to widen smack the milkshake travels from window to window and broke square on the bridge of his nose and all over his blacked out interior all in the same time as my friend took off to the right at that intersection in the same cocky manner as the asshole did at the last looking back through the rear window i think he had to remain stopped to process the defeat he had just been dealt tldr friends car gets egged by random driver friend gets immediate revenge throwing milkshake at drivers face and all over his blacked out leather interior edit some shit bothered me about my writing so i fixed it and thanks for the feedback

background information my family is a family of three middle class and we grew up in a nice area nothing too fancy nothing terrible just your typical suburbia with neighborhood parks churches amp schools all within walking distance we were nice to our neighbors and all knew each other my parents had a outdoor fire pit that they like to sit outside on the back patio and drink listen to music grill and relax outside my family is very respectful of rules so the music was almost never loud we dont throw parties and we kept mainly to ourselves but invited people over occasionally when i was in eighth grade we had some new next door neighbors move in they were a family of four mom dad son daughter the son was a year older than me and the daughter was a year younger than me the daughter and i hit it off immediately as friends but i noticed something was off when i would go over for the purpose of secrecy i will change their names lets call them the smiths the smiths had a weird idea of how to interact with people i get it everyone is different they were very blunt and open about everything never would say thank you didnt think about others they just turned out to be scum of the earth when it came to treating other people with dignity and respect just weird people but i guess it takes all kinds the dogs my family had a medium sized basenji that my dad had trained very well when i was a junior in high school daughter smith really wanted to have a new dog daughter smith basically got whatever she wanted being the younger sibling and could do no wrong so mother smith got her a beautiful german shepard ill call the dog asshole now asshole really isnt the one to blame the smiths never corrected the dog so its honestly no surprise that asshole never behaved the dog grew up doing whatever he wanted he was constantly off the leash in the front yard tried to pick fights with my dog in the back yard he was always trying to dig under the fence or in some places tried to knock the fence down asshole was obsessed with running the fence line with my basenji and just trying to get to him whenever we saw him they got into a few dog fights when asshole got loose but i promise it was never my dogs fault that this pound sack of fur ran into our yard and picked a fight the prestory a few years of this behavior go by and the smiths and my family arent friendly anymore we would express to them that their dog was trying to get to our dog that the fence was in bad shape that my dad and i were constantly filling the holes under the fence that their dog had dug they just didnt care my family went into their own pockets to replace sections of fence and just doing that pissed them off by the time we are absolutely fed up with it i had gone off to university and was a sophomore the story a few days before thanksgiving asshole dug yet another hole under the fence since i wasnt at home playing with the dog as much and my parents were fixated on getting thanksgiving plans ready no one noticed the hole the friday after thanksgiving my parents were out relaxing in the back yard the dogs were running the fence line and i was about to leave to go hangout with some old high school friends i went outside to tell my parents that i was leaving when we hear the most horrid yelp by any animal that i have ever heard asshole had dug far enough to put his head under the fence and bit the shit out of my dog half of his paw was torn almost completely off as well as some other things that i wont describe long story short we had to put my dog down because of it now the smiths refused to acknowledge what had happened they never once said sorry never once offered to pay any part of the medical bills nothing as far as they were concerned we were the dead ones not my dog the revenge by this point my family is pissed and we have nothing but time on our hands we devise our revenge over the course of a few months it had to be gradual and cost them time effort money and most importantly make them feel like shit first step collect dog shit ill come back to that later second step take them to court and get their dog classified as a dangerous dog if you ever have the chance to look at the hoops you have to go through to keep a dangerous dog you would know its horrible the requirements change depending on where you live but in our area the dog had to be muzzled while outside never could be off a leash pay fines has to have a special crate in their back yard which was hard for them because they had a pool random surprise inspections and if the dog has another incident the dog has to be put down to be clear the goal wasnt to hurt the dog just make their life difficult for as long as the animal was alive what was important for us us that it set up a record with the city and police department we slowly convinced our neighbors to call them in on every violation that they did for months park more than inches off the curb ticket loud music past quiet hours ticket now i know youre thinking that calling the cops and making them pay tickets isnt revenge and youre rightit was our cover we started to play our music loud right up till quiet hours ever single night for three months when they got fed up with it and tried to call the cops there was nothing they could do wed politely explain that they have had a record of doing the same thing and then they would get reprimanded instead third step summer rolls around and now im home and working a job so all of my nights are free the smiths son was working second shift at some restaurant so he never got home until after midnight during the summer in texas your car could reach f to the touch in midday point being even at midnight the car was hot the best part was that all of the smiths cars were parked outside my mom got this idea after one of her friends got pranked by putting glitter in the air vents that defog your windows we decided to step it up a notch if you take frozen shrimp or fish let it thaw for a day get it nice and smelly put it in a blender with a crap ton of water then freeze it into ice cubes you can imagine what that smells like when it thaws one smelly freezer vs what we didworth it over the course of june when anyone would check the mailbox which was perfectly placed on the other side of the smiths house we would drop one of those nasty ice cubes into the defogger vent of the sons car then halfway through june we started moving on to the moms car like clockwork we would see them on weekends trying to air out their cars all day making it even easier to throw in ice cubes all summer remember that dog shit i told you about heres the fourth part the daughter was a big swimmer all the time her parents never made her have a job so all she would do is swim all day and night if she wasnt hanging out with friends my dad came up with the idea of shit bombs when he bought a slingshot to shoot down hornets nests after doing some yard work while still having gloves he would load up that slingshot with dog shit shoot it over the fence and into their pool at first it was only a couple of pieces then it grew to a few more by that point we had gotten another dog and right before their big party we unloaded the rest of the shit we had the daughter and her friends were swimming for about hours before they noticed the shit floating in the pool the fifth step took a lot longer to accomplish their air conditioner was right on the other side of our fence you could get on your tip toes and see the unit less than five feet away remember those nasty ice cubes we started throwing them on top of their unit and they would melt and eventually made the house smell then instead of fish in the cubes we slowly replaced them with gravel and sand the sand and gravel would rattle around at night causing them to no be able to sleep between the smell and the sound finally they called out an ac repair man who tried to fix it the ac guy basically told them he had no idea how sand and gravel was in the unit but that it would eventually need to be replaced the smiths got suspicious and eventually put up cameras around their house so we had to back off some final part we wanted to move to a different city by the time i was almost graduated from college so we were model citizens and just didnt talk to them when our house did sell and we were moving out i waited to check the mailbox until they were out in their front yard i checked the mail and began my walk back home when they said something along the lines of glad to see you move or good riddance i stopped to turn at them made a show of smelling the air and said do you smell fish then smiled before walking back home their faces as they figured it out was priceless dont kill my dog ill fuck your shit up edit okay i get it yall say the house wouldnt smell obviously the plan still worked cause thie ac was messed up 
this is by far the meanest thing i have said to anyone in public and it cost me a lot of female friends during college i worked at a restaurant with a fairly large staff between servers and hostess on any given season i was friends with pretty much everyone and there was always a group of us hanging out after each shift late night house parties etc because of that staff dating was common i never really dove into the staff dating pool but there was one particular girl i was fond of at the time we got along flawlessly and we were hanging out all the time during work and afterwards at parties rumor spread that we were secretly dating i tried asking her out a few times but she always turned me down never giving a reason i wasnt salty about it just figured i wasnt her type or she wasnt attracted to me no big deal she was still cool to hang out with about a year goes by and finally a few of my female coworkers discovers the reason why this girl kept turning me down the big mysteryi was too short nothing else that was the only thing holding her back the news spread quickly not going to lie it made me bitter but i held my tongue for almost another year over that period she had gone off to school we still kept in touch and i stayed friendly with her because she was still picking up shifts when she was back in town during the holidays or springsummer breaks anyways college life must have hit her hard she packed on the freshman and a little more i wouldnt say she got fat maybe chubby she went from say pounds to this is when i started noticing her attitude towards dating me had changed her friends were dropping hints like crazy that i should ask her out again despite the fact of her shallow reasoning beforehand this is where i hit my tipping point and was pissed off to my core it all came to a boiling point one fateful night after work we were both liquored up and she kept pushing me for an answer on why i hadnt asked her out yet so i gave it out loud in front of all the coworkers at the party people i tried asking you out for a year and you turned me down every time neevvverr giving me a reason why now im dateable the only reason you wouldnt go out with me before was because i was too short nothing has changed minus you packing on a few lbs and your selfesteem has dropped you were shallow so heres my reason because i dont date fat chicks of the female staff stopped speaking to me after that as i was crowned the biggest asshole in the world however of the guys agreed it was a double standard and justice was served to be honest it was her shallow attitude that hit me the most and i wanted her to know what that felt like its been over years now and looking back i sometimes ask myself if i should have said it and my answers hasnt changed yet yes yes i would edit fawned to fond ill laughing at myself it is funny add on wow do some girls really not see this as a double standard getting a lot of hate email add on she openly told a group of about female coworkers not sure what she thought was going to happen word spread and yes i was publicly humiliated as it because a common joke at work i bit my tongue and take all of it for a year my issue was her changing her mind like im some nd place prize her friends assumed i wasnt interest anymore because of her weight gain and throw it in my face all the time that she was still the same person i never said a word about her weight before that night label me asshole then an asshole i will be 
so a friend of the mentioned sister has a set of twins no clue where they picked up this habit but about every two minutes of their waking lives they love to scream in the way only year old children can the kind of scream that is so high pitched your ears will ring after only a few seconds of it but these two little girls dont just scream for a few seconds they hold this sound for what seems like eternity until their mom screams back at them to stop so this sounds really annoying and it is but these girls have actually turned out to be pretty good for me since i dont see them but like times a year max and heres how just a few months ago my sister asked if i wanted to go to the zoo with her and my nephew the friend with the two minibanshees and our other sister who is cf like me i say sure i love seeing the aminals and taking pictures of the pretty birds so why not we go and the twins throughout are pretty good no screaming and were already about half way through the day were taking our lunch break at this big multirestaurant plaza on one side of the zoo and the two girls start their screaming thing when they finish eating my sisters kid my nephew is pretty laid back and usually pretty quiet hes just like his mom except that my sister is also one of those people that once they get a stick up their ass will push their point in a conversation until you just give up because she just doesnt make sense anymore being that i am cf and have proclaimed as much for many years she likes to say someday youll change your mind all of the time so on this fateful day as im eating a piece of pizza and have just heard the first set of screams from the twins she starts with how that sound doesnt bother her as much as it bothers me because im not a mommy yet as soon as she says this i look down at my nephew who is just at the age of understanding and being able to kindaanswer questions i say do you hear the sound their making he looks at them for a second looks back at me and nods and i give him my most encouraging smile mommy loves that sound you should make it for her all the time cue the moment i stood and walked to another table with my other cf sister who is just laughing her ass of as our nephew joins the chorus of screams and ignores his mom whos saying stop over and over again in the parent patented my snowflake does no wrong voice and she is being promptly ignored by him as usual the rest of the zoo visit continues with me and cf sister splitting from childed sister and childed friend so that we can actually look at animals instead of walking past as the kids cant stop or theyll disengage from their strollers and run amok we enjoy ourselves even more as we get a chorus of vocal reminders of where they are in other parts of the zoo the entire afternoon we leave that afternoon before our sister and her friend are done since we drove separately and i dont think much of it fast forward to today ish months after the zoo trip we live in different cities which are only minutes apart and because of work and stuff we dont meet up very often my sister calls me and in the background i hear the screaming its been over months and he still does it even when the twins arent around after hanging up from our brief chat about an upcoming wedding were both attending i suddenly realize that i have gotten the most longstanding revenge i could possible get without actually being there and doing anything to her myself i shall now bask in the glow of what ive done update we went to our other sisters kid so our nephews birthday party recently he turned her screaming monster finally quit the screaming sometime recently but i know that dad must have been the one to do something based on what happened there brother in law d is playing with all the kids and trying to keep them entertained when i notice the screamer being really mean to d hitting him with sticks and saying mean things because he talks more now were sitting at a nearby table with some other adults watching all of this me shouldnt you stop him from acting like that her well i didnt rile him up d did so d gets to settle him back down cf sister i thought you were his parent me no because that means shed actually take responsibility and whip his ass for something once in a while her glares then walks away after a minute to go talk to someone else while ignoring her child

i dated a girl for about four years lets call her brandy we were best friends before we dated then we dated for about four years she was awesome i loved her very dearly as far as i knew we were awesome together and great as friends and as lovers we rarely ever fought we got along great we got engaged and had plans to get married as far as i knew everything was perfect in fact i still doubt i will ever find another partner that i am that compatible with i spoiled her too maybe that was my biggest fault i always let her go shopping whenever wherever she wanted i kept her fed from a golden spoon and wrapped in the finest linens even if she didnt ask i typically enjoyed spoiling her thats just how i am she had recently gotten a part time job as a funeral directors assistant paying an hour and i had subsequently gotten her a new cellphone line for her as a work line as a celebratory gesture because she had been wanting a note and wasnt due for an upgrade she said she would pay for the balance on the old phone with her first check then one autumn day our only car got repoed she called the bank the bank said i was three months behind on my payments i knew that wasnt right thats when she told me it wasnt working out she said she was tired of being broke and struggling financially she wanted something better out of life than being broke all the time the interesting thing to note here is that she hadnt worked in a couple years and had been living off of my paycheck im a network engineer live confortably in a fairly nice house with lots of the latest toys and gadgets and everything but my newest car is paid for i would hardly call that struggling but it apparently wasnt good enough for her so she left after the car got repoed i was upset about it and went to my mothers house for the day while she packed her shit while i was at my moms i paid the repo fees and the past due balance for the amount the bank told me that was owed turns out the balance was for a different account the bank had repoed the wrong vehicle and given me the wrong account number to pay so i paid somebody else account they fixed it applied the balance to my not past due account and promptly gave me my car back i came back that evening with some friends and she had taken everything she took all of the furniture except a couch and my bed and my kids beds she took collectibles decorations food basically everything that wasnt nailed down also when she left she took her two cellphones that i have been paying for on a payment plan so i still had to deal with my cell phone bill being mo for three phones when i only use one of them i still owe for those two phones then there was a matter of a loan she had taken out with my mom that she had agreed in writing to pay back i sent her an email a few days later asking for my stuff back and for the money she owed and she responded that i was harrassing her and that if i ever contacted her again she would call the cops and threatened bodily harm from her stepdad so i suspended her lines and didnt say anything she called me from a borrowed phone the next day to ask me if i was going to tell her before i turned her phone off i said i didnt feel like i need to since they were my phones and the account was in my name since then she has tried to have my electricity turned off which didnt happen because they called me to confirm she has tried to sell my car without having it in her possession which failed she has tried to call the police on me for harassment dumped trash in my yard and called the homeowners association and broken into my house and left things and taken other things on several different occasions i have changed my locks and set up security cameras since then so enough of the backstory heres where my revenge comes in i took her to small claims court for for property and damages and all the money she owed and i won granted i have to pay to have that enforced and honestly i dont even care to enforce it but i won revenge is mine i also got a promotion at my job since she left was recently given a a raise and a big fat bonus just got a voucher from delta since they screwed up my flight and things are generally better than they had been before she left tenfold she lives with her mom in a tiny room with no air conditioner and no heater cant get a car my buddy owns a car lot she tried to buy from him because everybody else had turned her down he turned her down on principal or a cell phone because of her credit and relies on friends and family to drive her to her day a week job and school she also owes for school loans for her first couple years and shes got four more years left to go but i guess thats better than struggling right tldr fiance tried to take everything because of an error on the banks part that resulted in our car being repoed screwed herself over in the process then i put the final nail in the coffin by suing her and winning edit a letter edit i just wanted to add this after i suspended her phone lines she got really angry and attempted to get revenge in a number of ways all of which failed she tried to sell my car to a dealership without having the car with her how stupid can you be she tried to have my electricity turned off she hacked my facebook broke into my house several times left things took other things until i changed the locks and put in security cameras she tried to close out my loan account with the bank and have them repo the car they told her as long as it was being paid for they wouldnt repo the vehicle under any circumstances she tried hacking all my email accounts bank accounts steam account xbox account and any other account she could to try and screw me over she managed to cancel one of my debit cards but it wasnt my main one and she didnt take any money she just wanted me to face the dificulty of not having a debit card she threatened me multiple times physical bodily harm from her stepdad and brother dumped trash on my lawn and called the homeowners association frequently sent me pictures of that cat that we adopted this one hurts a little bit but ill never let her know that made sure that everybody knows what a horrible person i am and how shitty i was througghout her entire relationship through all that the only time i ever contacted her was to ask for my stuff back once thats it i gave her a list of stuff that she took told her she had a week to give it back or else if she ever attempted to contact me i ignored it completely she flipped the fuck out and started trying to somehow enact revenge i never once called the police on her i never let on that any of it bothered me i never said hey why did you do this but she kept on continously trying to screw me over failing every single time i never flinched or batted an eye that to me is the unltimate victory 
i dont know if this is truly petty revenge but it may fit a few weeks ago one of our fellow employees be for belittled employee decided he had enough of his managers constant belittlement and short temper so he gave his weeks notice and let them know he was more than happy to work those two weeks to finish off his job said anger management issues manager ami is also an owner of the company he absolutely loses it he starts screaming at the guy telling him to leave the premises immediately and flips him the bird on the way out the parking lot this action causes immense problems for us in the short term be had a transmission for a large machine pulled apart with hundreds of parts strewn across his bench that was friday i come in on tuesday morning and i am informed the other owners have decided they need to buy this owner out finally this wasnt the first time he had cost us an employee i was hired and work directly under the general manager gm who is also an owner with his brother while we are talking about this in my office i politely ask my boss to hang on and i dig through my desk and fire up some of our accounting software i quietly show some of the evidence of amis misdealings to gm it isnt enough to be a smoking gun of fraud that is why i was waiting before bringing it to him i also only noticed the issues a few weeks ago and was waiting until i had more evidence gm smiled slightly thanked me and left we went back to business as usual until the buyout ffw to now ami is getting bought out after they have settled on a price for the buyout and signed everything gm brings the evidence of fraud against ami which he has now added to by digging a little deeper ami now has to pay back the fraudulent payments out of his buyout resulting in him getting approximately less than what he thought he was getting update found out how the gm handled it ami signed all the papers and signed something to the effect that his departments financials were accurate just after he signed that paper gm reveals the paperwork in epic fashion as per his brothers description ami absolutely loses his shit and starts screaming his lawyer had to calm him down business valuation was around million and he had a stake so it cost him also a call has been placed to the revenue agency in our country for suspected tax evasion by gm and yours truly as my boss has evidence of some private fraud now as well update bosses are implementing an employee purchase plan for stock ownership voting shares and essentially they are giving me of the company shares as my bonus along with a raise ill take it tldr angry owner loses his shit on employee other owners decide to buy him out i present evidence of fraud to owners and he gets less money at the buyout edit moved tldr to bottom
my parents live in a pretty suburban neighborhood and kinda keep to themselves they are indian and are the nicest people but are quiet to everybody except a few well known friends in the neighborhood they also have heavy indian accents most of the neighborhood are exceptionally nice to us except this one kid who hates my parents for complaining about him speeding down our residential inner roads at dumb speeds and makes fun of them using tasteless mocking of their accents long story short this kid got his buddies together and driveby baseball batted our mailbox there was no way to prove it was him and i only knew he did it because he would make fun of my dad or myself when we went to our bent mailbox and he happened to be passing by windows rolled down yelling out oh no in a fake indian accent and driving away even worse was we ended up fixing the mailbox once and over a year and half later it was batted down again i suspect the same kid but again had no way to prove it was him this last year however i decided to say fuck this kid and built a brolic concrete pole for our mailbox with rebar in it i painted it too to make it nonobvious it was cement and made sure to put those solar lights on it so that itd be lit in the night and no one would accidentally run into it the only reasonable chance of hitting it would be if you were trying this kid took over a year for his previous revenge so we ended up waiting after building that until last thanksgiving during the night we heard a loud clink outside of what sounded like aluminum bat being stopped dead in its tracks a short loud yelp and a car speeding off in the morning it looked like this kid hasnt mouthed off yet and his hand was in one of those braces for a while it felt satisfying i plan to mime a hurt hand every time he drives by again

a couple of decades ago mids i had occasion to need body work done on my car kid in the lane to my right tried to turn left without looking and took it into a large and supposedly wellregarded body shop for repairs in hindsight i shouldve known it wouldnt turn out well when they refused to give me a quote without seeing my insurance estimate first to keep this short suffice to say that they screwed it up charged for undercoating that wasnt applied got cheap nonoem replacement parts ignored instructions to replace the fender was okayed by the insurance co and slathered a couple of pounds of bondo on it instead doing a miserable job of matching the contours and myriad other screwups within a week of getting the car back from them id returned with a long list of problems quality complaints and omissions the general manager found later he was the owners nephew and had a rep for being an asshole basically blew me off with a combination of indifference and rudeness as to the quality complaints he said look this car isnt worth putting cadillaclevel work into it you want it done better youll have to pay us more money i then did what most pissedoff customers do badmouth the company to anyone who would listen anytime i saw any car in need of bodywork id warn the owner against this body shop making my case by showing them the poor work done on my car i continued doing this for at least years until i finally sold the car the real revenge part was that about every to months id call the shop and ask to speak to the gm when i got him on the phone id identify myself as a poed former customer and tell him that id saved a dozen or so people from his companys shoddy work and id probably cost his shop about or thereabouts the first two calls he blew off by the th call he was getting worried and wanted my name and for me to come in so that we could come to an agreement and get you satisfied i told him he had already blown his one chance to make good by insulting me when i came back to get them to do the job right as to my name i told him he could easily find it by going over his list of customers whod come back with complaints about the work theyd done i continued the calls even after id sold the car for about years or so towards the end of that time id point out to him that his attitude had potentially cost his company over worth of work on my last call i actually got the owner the nephew was on vacation and spent a good minutes on the phone with him explaining why id made it a year mission to cost them as much business as i possibly could and that his jerk of a gm had blown any chance of ever getting me to quit badmouthing them i later heard from friends at a wrecking yard in the same town that the body shop had a new gm
sorry this is short but there really isnt a whole lot that went into it basically we have a vp who is the caricature of asshole bosses he verbally abuses his subordinates he confuses bullying with leadership and he doesnt have a god damn clue what hes doing well i and a few other project managers had enough of his shit we met for lunch and one of my colleagues came up with a great plan we learned the csos daughter was looking for a position so we put in a recommendation for her and told her to do everything she could to hide her relation under the auspices that the vp and her dad didnt get along and wanted to make sure she could get the job she got the job it went way better than we hoped not only did he give her shit and swear at her on a number of occasions apparently he called her into his office and told her the only position he was willing to keep her for was under his desk we got the organizational announcement on friday and it seems the vp is off to pursue the next great chapter of his life i hope that chapter involves him shoveling shit somewhere i didnt see the announcement until today when one of the other pms texted mission accomplished i get dozens of those things in a week and i just ignore them half the time
when i was i had a cat that i loved she came when i cried slept in my bed the works one day she came home real fucked up she had a in hole in her chest cracked rips and her spine was snapped at the base of her tail we took her to the vet and they told us she had been beaten up by some kids they had hit her with a golf club and swung her around by her tail almost killed her she had to go through surgery but she lived we called the police who told us they couldnt do anything because she probably was hit by a car even though there were no scratches on her or dabris from a road but that wouldnt stop me from getting my revenge later that week on the bus some of the kids from down the street were bragging about the cat they beat up i asked them for the details acting all excited about it once i was sure it was them i hatched my plan a week or so after that i snuck out of the house stole a gas can from the garage and a box of matches i walked through the woods i live in the middle of fucking nowhere to the kids house now this kid loved his dirt bike and he kept it in his back yard so i hopped the fence and poured the gas all over this dirt bike and set it on fire then like a god damn badass i walked back to my house i never got caught or even questioned seeing that kid crying on the bus telling his shitty friends how he no longer had a dirt bike to ride was the most satisfying thing of my life
i found my way here via a story over on tales from retail because a user had suggested one story should be crossposted here after reading some of the stories here and giggling to myself at my work desk i recalled a story from my teenage years that should definitely be shared i spent my high school years in a small town in wisconsin there were only a few stop lights and everyone knew everyone if you screwed up or did something embarrassing everyone knew about it within hours sometimes sooner i had a small circle of friends and then a host of acquaintances that i hung out with from time to time one of them is the center of our story he was a pretty good guy well call him ted for storys sake the problem of course was that he was your standard outcast in high school life he wasnt athletic played video games in a time when gamers truly were considered nerds or geeks and was a skinny kid with glasses which made him easy to pick on i have been and always will be a gamer so he and i had no issues getting along i was slightly more athletic and played football so i was able to at least keep some guys off of his back for him there was nothing i could do about the hockey guys though lets go to the event in question it was a saturday and we were at the bowling alley with a couple of our mutual friends all was going well until several members of said hockey team come walking in and of course get put in the lane just a couple down from us close enough where they could be dicks and show off in front of their girlfriends of course they singled him out and left the rest of us alone but that doesnt really fly very well with me and tried to get them to stop which failed of course after putting up with their bullshit for an entire game ted finally showed a little backbone and quite loudly told them to shut the fuck up and leave him alone well in small town logic doing something like that means you are asking for more trouble or maybe its just terrible high schooler logic that you dont want one of the players said to him oh youre going to be a big man now well dont worry well put you in your place i stepped in and told them to just leave us alone and that nothing needed to happen because it was really pointless as just about everything was regarding high school issues they stopped it and we finished our game heading out to one of our mutual friends house to hang out there we think nothing of it and i head home pretty late that night my phone rings the next morning its ted hes crying ted gnpunk they egged my house last night gtthe hockey guys ted yes its a mess gthow bad is it and how do you know it was them ted one of them called me to rub it in we had the windows open some of it got in here i headed over there shortly and sure enough the house was absolutely pelted and covered with yolk marks egg shells etc inside the house were at least seven or eight direct hits it was pretty gross i stuck around and helped him clean it up during the cleanup though i realized that ted was not only over his crying but he was plotting revenge when we were done cleaning up he started calling up a couple of his friends for ideas he wasnt going to be able to get everyone back but he could at least get the one that seemingly led the charge and he did get him holy shit did he get him being in wisconsin one thing that underagers really like to do besides drink illegally is to chew tobacco he had a couple of friends who did just that and because they werent exactly the cleanest people around had some bottles of spit and other things laying around he asked them to bring him whatever they could before they came over with those bottles he went and bought a couple dozen eggs i assumed he was going to return the favor of egging the house and just taking it one step further nope he was out to do damage gtso whats the plan ted im going to get however big of a container that i need and throw all of this together rotten eggs chew spit whatever else i can find throws up in mouth a little gtthatswow thats pretty damn good you going to throw it on the assholes house ted oh no something way better than that he ended up combining all of it into a small bucket there was a lot of it it was extremely disgusting to top it off he left it outside in the sun to just kind of stew for awhile it was an unusually warm spring for us so leaving that outside to stew was pretty damn ingenious he left it outside for a week by the time the following weekend rolled around this was some of the worst smelling shit i had ever encountered the kid had a plan and he was going to do whatever he had in mind his parents were trying to figure out if it was possible to do an investigation but with no witnesses there wasnt much they could do phone calls meant nothing and ted figured this was the best option teds plan was simple you see hockey asshole had a brand new truck it also had a pretty good sound system in it and these guys would hang out in parking lots and just sit around talking bitching and he would have his windows wide open ted was getting that bucket of wretchedness into the cab of his truck he didnt care how unfortunately i was not around to witness this i was out of state with family the weekend that it occurred but i did get the phone call from our friend who drove him to the hang out he was lucky enough to catch them in the parking lot and far enough away from the truck where he had a clean shot they pulled up along side of the truck and ted managed to pop out launch the contents of the bucket into the cab through the window and get back into the car before they could make it to him while on the phone with the getaway driver i could hear ted laughing so hard in the background he was hyperventilating i was concerned that he was going to get into major trouble but he truly did not give a fuck he had reached his breaking point and was basking in the glory of his revenge i got back to school on monday and it was the talk of the school the trucks interior was flat out ruined and smelled like sex panther he couldnt even drive it because ted had managed to do a surgical strike and douse just about everything and then just chucked the bucket into it upside down to ensure it all got in there he had become a legend in the manner that he had hoped for ted had been concerned that he was going to get his ass kicked because of this and truth be told i think everyone expected it however it didnt happen because word had already reached the higher ups in the school my town was very much a good ol boy town where eye for an eye still meant something the two of them were brought into a meeting and told that they were not to even speak to each other as for the damages caused both sets of parents were informed of what was shared in the meeting where each of them admitted to their actions the parents were asked to handle discipline of each of their children and to work out the issue of the damages caused the parents ended up agreeing to just take care of their own problems and leave it at that no one bothered ted after that hockey assholes truck became known as the spit cup truck which pissed him off to no end ted ended up getting a girlfriend out of the whole mess because honestly showing that kind of balls it just had to happen he never really became a popular kid in high school but no one dared to fuck with him after that and that my friends is a dish of revenge served ice cold tldr friend gets his house egged by asshole revenge comes in the form of a bucket of tobacco spit and rotten eggs in said assholes truck hilarity ensues
after posting this on ridontworkherelady i was told i should post it here hope you guys like it i just discovered this sub and have spent the better part of the day procrastinating and laughingcrying as i can relate so on to the backstory the town i lived in wasnt huge and at the time only had one gas station i got a job there at the ripe old age of and worked there for years by the end of my time there i was essentially number with the manager and assmanager ahead in charge eventually another gas station opened up across the road and i got a job there there was pretty high turnover so by the end of my tenure there everybody else including the managers were new this story takes place about a year after i left them one last thing to say puberty is a bitch and didnt feel like making its way over to me forever so from age to i looked like the same not exactly but i looked really young until about a little bit insecure about it soooo since i knew all the employees at the store i would always get gas and grab a nice ice cold chocolate milk from there rather than my store when i got to the fridge with my milk i was dismayed to find that there was no more but seeing as i spent the entirety of my working time at the same store i knew that they kept the stock in the back of the walkin fridge behind some boxes this fridge was also where all the beer was so when a customer old bitch noticed that i knew what i was doing assumed i worked there that seems fair considering she had probably seen me there on many occasions and i usually have no problem helping people oh if i had known that how good a day this would turn out to be ob hey kid knowing that there wasnt anybody else in this tight ass fridge i turned around from fumbling about in the boxes ob ya you go put this case of beer at the cashholding out case of beer even if i did work there i wouldnt have done it but i figured id gently remind them i am an actual person me sorry i dont work here anymore plus miss that was really rude im going to have to assumed that i triggered something for her because she lost her shit screaming about how she had seen me here before and she knew i worked here i tried to get a word in edgewise but was unable to and with her between the door and myself i figured i might as well try and ignore her and find my chocolatey goodness oblook at me when im talking to you you ungrateful child melook it seems like youre having a bad day so im going to let all that slide and just remind you that i no longer work here with a huff she turned around and walked out but not before she threw out one last insult obyour mother must have been incompetent to have raised such a selfish boy i had been having a good day up until that point because my usual self is a vindictive little shit who normally would have screamed right back at her that changed when she insulted my mother i found my drink and went to the registers these machines were ancient and took about minutes to boot up and glitches frequently karma strikes quick and without mercy for when i got to the cash they were having some technical problem with it and the screen was frozenglitchedkarma knowing there was nobody in the store except for myself the bitch and my buddy who just started working there about months prior i was in no rush to help when my friend finally got fed up with trying the usual debug procedure he looked up and asked for my help when working there i was the goto person and i still frequently got calls from the management asking if i could pop by and fix something for them in exchange for some free candy winwin i glanced over at the screen and immediately recognized the problem and knew that it was a simple fix all he had to do was click two buttons at the same time if you had thought that ob had gotten an quieter as this whole process was going on you were wrong she must have seen the recognition in my face when i saw it because she started howling at me to fix it so she could get out of there seeing my chance for revenge i struck meapologize obstunned lookwhat did you say to me me i would like you to apologize to me and ill fix the problem obyou little shit fix it right now or ill have you fired meid like to remind you that i dont work here and i still expect an apology i assume she was running late because after another minutes of back and forth she finally relented obgrumbleim sorry now will you fix the machine and normally i would have accepted it but i still had another minutes to get kill before i started work at the gas station across the road so i figured id push it mesorry for what more incoherent yelling from this lady and my friend tries to stifle his laughter mei didnt hear an apology in there obim sorry for being rude even though you were being a brat i stared at her just thinking she was so close so so close she could have been free to enjoy her beer and free to annoy anybody else that crossed her path but alas it was not meant to be menah i dont accept have a nice day she had a dumb look on her face before it turned to a scowl and she started screaming again ob i swear im never coming back to this gas station ever again the employees here are expletive expletive expletive as she stormed out now most people would be content with that i however was not i quickly hit the buttons fixing the machine and ran out yelling a quick goodbye and telling him im pay for this tomorrow see she swore the one thing i knew she wouldnt be able to keep she swore she was never coming back to that gas station which could only mean she had one place to go for her booze across the road to the gas station i work at the place where im the number employee and where the owner would back me up if he were there and if he wasnt i was in charge i ran over to my job and told the cashier to him to take a break sit back and enjoy the show by the time i got there she had already rushed into the fridge to get her beer and when she got out she was greeted by the sight of me grinning from ear to ear behind the register cut to minutes of swearing later and she leaves again sans beer my coworker standing there slack jawed wondering how i was able to stand that verbal tirade and even more confused as to why i kept on laughing even more as she went on that was a good day edit since the post blew up on ridontworkherelady i decided to throw in a bonus unrelated story and figured i might as well share it here for that lovely compliment ive decided to share a completely unrelated story from my time working at the gas station im sure you got this from the above story but if you didnt ill tell you about myself i can keep calm in virtually any situation that said some people get to me it could be anybody doing something that just makes something snap it very rarely happens but this was one of those times it was a day like every other when in walks a middle aged gentlemen now normally you would here how this guy looked like a tool or he came in swearing but not in this story this man looked like your average joe maybe he looked a little grumpy but it was early sunday morning my favourite shift for other reasons so i could forgive a little frown so i gave this man my usual cheerful greeting which was answered with a short grunt still at least he acknowledge i said something not great but better than being ignore as he reached into his pocket and threw his lottery ticket and some change at me now nobody likes having shit thrown at them but i had had it happen before and it would certainly happen again i assumed he wanted me to check his ticket and replay it but i figured it would be best to ask just in case now only because i had been working in gas stations for years was i able to guess thats what he wanted my question which was certainly valid was met with this response obviously now shut up and do your job eye twitch wtf i stared are him its on i dont know how im going to get back at him and i havent seen him before which must mean he doesnt live in town i only have moments left to get back at him but due to a combination of tiredness and laziness this sunday morning i couldnt think of a clever way to get back at him my mind was racing shower him with kindness no not enough time throw his money on the ground could do better i was running out of time as i got his change and then i went to the default way i dealt with assholes i felt like i had failed i could do so much and yet i was left to see him out with a cliche hope your day is as pleasant as you are i yelled out as he was almost out the door thinking to myself how i had just missed the perfect opportunity thats when it happened he turned back he was walking back in this was it round was happening at this point i was for all the insults i hurled at puberty it threw them right back at me and hit me like a freight train i went from pounds soaking wet to lbs of muscle i was not about to be intimidated by this man he scowled and then he went full soccer mom demanding to speak to my manager threatening to get me fired etc this went on for minutes before he left as i got the final words have a great day and remember to go fuck yourself it was not the greatest of wins but i believe i finished on the upper hand i just didnt understand how somebody could get under my skin that easily i pushed the thought from my mind knowing i wouldnt get in any trouble for what i said all was forgotten until about months later im working my usual sunday morning shift ampm nursing my hangover from the night before not sure if im still drunk or not when in walks a customer my head ringing because of the buzzer on the door the man walks up and throws his shit at me and i ignore it because it hurts to look at the light finally handing the man his cash i look up and this man his face it looks familiar no it doesnt mean anything i see the same people all the time i started to feel angry at this man for some reason i couldnt understand why this random customer was infuriating me so much just looking at me as i had his change in my hand my mind was telling my body to give him the change so i could get back to my nap but i couldnt bring myself to do it hey are you going to do your job or just stand there my eye refocused i realized i still had the money in my hand so i put it on the counter instead of his outstretched hand thats not very nice i thought to myself as i looked up again he was scowling and it clicked my eyes flashed recognition at the same time as his did i saw him open his mouth but i had already started to unleash what would be the round one knock out didnt i tell you to fuck off already reaching down for the business card with the ownermanagers number on it i slammed it down on the counter and went back to my corner to wait for the count to declare me the undisputed champion as he walked out of the store already pulling out his phone i laid back and waited for the inevitable phone call i was about to receive from the owner i smiled as i drifted back into my hangover induced nap
a friend of mine was electrocuted at work it was pretty bad later on he was fired because he was electrocuted fortunately he turned that around when he learned he could get disability for the electrocution but it knocked out several teeth that arent coming back anyway i called osha and told them about the electrocution they werent so interested in that but perked right up when i told them that the place routinely locked the emergency fire exit doors to prevent employees from stepping outside to sneak a smoke well they inspected found the locked emergency exit doors and went to town on them turns out a long time ago a business on the east coast locked the security doors and there was a fire killing several dozen people osha gets very very sensitive about stuff like that the owner was fined k for the security doors he also spent quite a bit of money fighting it for years but eventually had to pay anyway
on the advice of my attorney i started recording all calls with my ex during the divorce process indiana at least at the time was a single party consent state meaning only one person in the conversation had to know it was being recorded the look on her face when i hit play and the judge got to hear her say i dont give a fuck what that bitch judge says you get visitation when i say you get visitation was absolutely priceless can you say contempt of court i got everything i wanted out of the divorce with the judge landing on my side for any contentious items she even made my ex pay my attorney fees tldr dont ever get caught calling a female judge a bitch edit the contempt was for refusing to comply with a court order of visitation not the language she used but the language she used did seem to prejudice the judge in my favor from that point on copied and pasted from this

so your typical trailer trash redneck family move into my grandpas rental house the father is a loud and easily enraged handyman his wife almost never seen and one son is a rapist while the other is a multifelon bag of nuts drugs and parties galore you get the idea the house which could fetch a monthwhich is generally a largenice house in our area is destroyed over five or six years for only a month when he actually pays it that is grandpa during this time is showing all the symptoms of dementia and would normally never let someone get the better of him like this so at one point i start working with my father doing up keep in grandpas place at this point i live in one of grandpas houses within walking distance of the one redneck has been living in so i of course had the great pleasure of being able to tape the multiple eviction notices to their doors when they hadnt paid rent for months after all of the legal proceedings it has been eight months that they havent paid rent and the sheriff is present as we set their things outside because the judge approved an immediate eviction it probably helped when they didnt even show up to court to defend themselves they hadnt been seen for a couple days so they werent present for this therefore we were courteous enough to bring in our own guys to carefully move their things out the lawman there were happy to take every little bit of paraphernalia that was found in the process redneck did show up later that night though so i stood on my porch out of sight and listened as he got out of his car to scream this is bullshit as loud as he could in full redneck accent we had already changed locks and literally bolted shut the windows so they left after collecting some random things and as is expected redneck squeeled his tires on the way out they broke in the back door that night but didnt do any other damage and were already gone the next morning we notified the police and replaced the door as it was weak anyway for the full picture the house is a two story three bedroom with two full baths two large living rooms two large fireplaces french doors onto a large deck and a garage as well as a carport in the back it also came with all of the appliances some furniture and whatnot the surrounding area is fields and woods with a really nice view out of the bay windows my dad built this house with his own hands in the s and i had been in the house before they moved in so it was genuinely sad to see the place like it was when its all done and over with they are moved out and my dad ends up having to put a little over into the house to make it livable it took three months of work and even after that a plumber and electrician had to go and fix several problems that were discovered with tests and use new renters get moved in as soon as possible all is good and well but then one day on my way to work i see the rednecks family car parked at the end of the lane its an old beater with the bumper and driver door both being different colors from the rest of the car so its hard to mistake our family owned business is where he would usually pay rent and im only at work for about an hour when i am told that i have a phone call on hold i take the line and he doesnt hesitate to start in his hard to understand lilt hey this is redneck my car needs fixed and i left in the lane can it stay there for a few days im grinning and i almost giggle after ive thought it over for a second sure i dont mind he hangs up just like that and i dont stop smiling as i start to look at local tow companies on the internet i find the one with the highest rates at the responsibility of the cars owner and gave them a call they even charged hourly for the time their driver was on the road so i was glad the place was a good while away after waiting only half an hour after work the tow showed up and i was happy to watch as he got the car hooked up once he got done i pointed him to the paved area where he could turn around and then he was gone it was on the forth day that i got a phone call from rednecks little wife and im certain he was staring at her the whole time as she politely asked where the car had been sent i think someone had it towed i tell her with a reassurance that i will call her back as soon as i find out who towed it and where that was on friday so guess who didnt hear from me until monday she answered and i told her hey i found out it was towingcompany being as polite as ever she thanked me and the line went dead so that was four business days and two weekend days before they got to the car as i imagine they went to get it as soon as they found out with the rates from their website i figured out that their bill should have been at least there is no way that these people would have that much money as none of them were employed their only money came from the two parents who got social security somehow despite only being in their fortiesearly fifties that was a year ago and ive never seen that car on the local streets since to this day i smile just thinking about it
my dad was in construction in the s in chicago and when the economy went bust he was hired by a company in houston that told him theyd pay his moving expenses after one year of employment he was brought in to be a general manager and the company he went to was having problems he was hired to solve my dad was very efficient and got things fixed quickly soon everything was a finetuned machine when his one year anniversary came up the day before the anniversary he was let go by the company and his job went to the owners son they told my dad they didnt have to pay him since the year wasnt up my dad was pretty pissed about it and by this time the economy in houston wasnt so great so it took a while for him to find a job when he did it was for a company that did subcontractor work from time to time for the company he was let go from as my dad was hired as an estimator at the new company he had to bid jobs for his former company as revenge he started adding money to each estimate at first it was just a little but over the course of the next years he would add tens of thousands to each job even though the money wasnt directly going into his pockets he did earn much larger bonuses and his employer realized much larger profit margins on the work from the other company as my dad was retiring he did an review of all the estimates he ever made for that company and found hed gotten million from them over years now my dad didnt get that money his employer did but that was million that would have stayed with his former employer so that k they screwed my dad out of cost them million over years he called the greatest caper of his life he passed away months after retiring sadly he giggled about it often though and he felt vindicated
this is my story of revenge from almost years ago bear with me im posting this from mobile and its a little long and im not the best writer what i did might not be right or ethical but sometimes revenge is more important the setup i was fresh out of the military where i had been a supply clerk running my units warehouse with about guys working for me the local job market was pretty crappy at the time the only place i could get a job was a distribution warehouse for a large clothing retailer the guy who hired me charles was former military like me and an all around decent guy he was the night shift supervisor typically this place filled positions with temp workers from the local manpower if you did a decent job as a temp the company would hire you as a seasonal worker and the best seasonal workers would get hired at full time on average out of temps would end up full time well in the eyes of quite a few people i fucked it all up because i was hired directly to full time on night shift with a promise of an interview for management as soon as there was an opening even though a few of the old timers didnt like the way i was hired i didnt let it stop me from making a few friends and within six months i was leading one of the teams on my shift with of us on each team let me tell you a little bit more about this place it was like nothing id seen before there were shift day and night each shift had about employees per department divided into teams and a shift supervisor the shift supervisors reported to the department manager and there were department managers that reported to the warehouse manager there was also it lots of automation and maintenance but most people didnt interact with those departments on a regular basis in my department we had major job functions opening closing loading and unloading in an hour shift you would typically spend hours doing each rotating stations between breaks what made this place unique at the time was the way they tracked your performance everyone carried around a gun that tied into the computer system and tracked literally everything you did it knew how fast you were unloading how many units per second you were opening how many boxes per hour you were closing etc the only process that wasnt tracked that closely was loading at each break you would get a report of how on target you were for production goals for each job in percentage officially as long as you were making at least of the goal you were on target but anything below would get you a demerit for the day which would go away if you finished the week above i was a hardcharger gunning for promotion so i typically ended the day above i think my lowest day for my first year there was at the start of each shift the supervisors would get a huge text file that had more detailed information about our performance they would spend a few hours every day analyzing it and compiling the data in it by hand into a spreadsheet that tracked performance for the week quarter and year around my month mark my knee was injured when some poorly stacked boxes fell on me and i was put on light duty for a month while i healed i would still opend and close but loading and unloading were off the table charles got the goahead from our manager stacy for me to stay in the office for the first hours of the shift and i would handle compiling the days data into the spreadsheet for him by the nd day of doing this it was obvious that this job could easily be automated so i did just that i wrote a script that would automatically pull the text document off the server import the data into excel and populate the spreadsheet for the entire year id done similar stuff in the military so this was oldhat by the end of the week it was working perfectly and i gave it to charles this saved him almost hours a day freeing him to spend more time on the other aspects of his job even though i had basically put myself out of a job for the remainder of my lightduty he still let me hang out in the office and wed bullshit about life our times in the service shit like that like i said he was a cool dude around this time my wife was pregnant with our second child which comes into play with what happened next and turned this all into a revenge story while i was on lightduty they had pulled one of the fulltimers off of day shift to come run my team hed been working there about years and felt like it was time for him to become a supervisor he was another high performer like me mostly due to his drug of choice well call him tweak tweak was also best friends with the dayshift supervisor well call him twat tweak stayed on nightshift after i was healed because there was a rumor going around that charles was up for promotion which would leave the nightshift supervisor job up for grabs pissing me off sure enough within months of me writing that script charles was promoted to manager of another department having all that free time probably helped but i wasnt mad because like i said he was a cool dude and deserved it he also put in a good word about me taking over his job charles leaves and any day now were all expecting them to post the listing for his job two weeks go by with no news and my wife goes into labor during one of my shifts i drive home take her to the hospital and she gives birth to a beautiful baby boy id been working at that warehouse for over a year so i took my fmla and spent weeks at home taking care of her and my son it turns out that our manager stacy had left twat in charge of hiring a replacement for charles the day after my wife gave birth he finally posted the opening he stacked the deck during an incredibly rushed interview process and tweak got the job all of this happened within a week of my leave starting i found out all of this from a coworker while i was still out so i used my time off to start looking for another job by the time my leave ended i had another job lined up i wont go into it but it paid almost times what the warehouse was paying me and actually sounded like a challenge heck im still with that company to this day to be honest i didnt even have revenge on my mind at this point i just wanted out but what happened next pushed me over the edge my leave ends but my new job doesnt start for weeks i wait a week and give my weeks notice during that first week im getting warnings about my performance every day which is bullshit because my breaktime performance reports are still saying im at i went into the office during my last break on friday and pull up the spreadsheet it turns out that during my time loading which isnt tracked for performance tweak had been logging me in as opening which was driving my numbers down at least i woulndt have to deal with it anymore as i gave notice that day at the end of my shift the next week i only worked monday and tuesday i had days of vacation on the books so i took them off leaving me to return on friday my last day i checked the spreadsheets at the end of monday and tuesday he was doing the same shit so i printed off the evidence just cya the next friday i returned for my last day i had cleaned out my locker on tuesday so really all i had to do was finish my shift and collect my final paycheck instead im greeted at the office by tweak and twat they have a few disciplinary writeups that they want me to sign apparently my performance was down all week and i had a nocall noshow for not working saturday i was dumbfounded why the hell would they write me up on my last day how the hell could my performance be down when i was on vacation and how could i be a nocall noshow on a day that wasnt scheduled while i was on vacation i refused to sign and told them id meet them at hr in minutes once i put my lunch away in the break room the revenge instead i called my sisters husband a sherrifs deputy and let him know that these goons had some meth or coke in their desks they usually did and walked to hr i outlined to hr what was going on with my performance and the writeups these dicks were trying to push on me tweak and twat came in and i dragged the whole confrontation out as long as i could we were in there arguing for close to an hour when the cops showed up they had a warrant to search the office in my department and pulled tweak and twat into the conference room while the search was conducted twats area was clean but they found a baggie of meth in tweaks desk and a couple of joints in his messenger bag tweak tried to say that i had planted it in there but id been gone all week and i had never set foot in the office that daybacked up by security cameras hr fired tweak on the spot as he was dragged out in handcuffs the company placed twat on probation but he managed to keep his job that was my petty revenge the spreadsheet is where it turned pro as i said id made similar spreadsheets before while i was in the military and id had other people take credit for creating them and try to pass them off as their own so i started putting deadman switches in them nothing too malicious just protecting the cells in each sheet and it performs a simple check when you would run the scripts it would pull all the data for the day but it would also check my personal website for one thing a multiplier i run a small email server for my family its nice having a personal email thats just firstnamelastnamecom it also has a webclient so we can check our email from our browsers hidden in the html for the webpage is a few variables that i use for different stuff the spreadsheet i made would pull the variable warehouse which was just set to and multiply or divide every cell and calculation by that i knew that charles had given twat a copy of the script and thats what he was using for all his reporting so when i got home i changed warehouse to or something like that a small enough change that it wouldnt be noticable on daily reports or even weekly but the quarterly reports were inflated enough to notice and the annual report was inflated enough that twat was fired for falsifying data to inflate his bonus charles let me know about that hes the warehouse manager now and he told me over beers a few months later
my high school biology teacher mentioned offhandedly that adding a small amount of a specific chemical to an acidic drink would safely cause normally alkaline urine to turn a vivid shade of red i had access to the chem storage and i nicked a modest supply i tested the substance on myself and was pleased to see a shocking color change my pee looked like cherry koolade cool i pranked my friends of course they were shocked the first time mildly amused the second or third time but after repeated assaults i would generally just hear goddamit midzo from the bathroom little fun i looked for additional targets the college guy next door seemed a good candidate i dosed his cola i didnt know he was a chemistry major he never said a word but a week later i peed blue blue welldeserved retribution points for style pro revenge indeed

first paragraphs are a bit of backstory real pro revenge story starts from paragraph tldr at bottom so im on my final year final semester for an electrical engineering degree i had completed all my major subjects however of us th year students hadnt done physics since the first semester physics is a st year subject divided into modules electricity optics modern physics but it surprisingly wasnt a prerequisite for any other subject however we needed to take it now to graduate being th year students we barely went to any lecture or did any coursework since it was a st year subject which we didnt take seriously the first module was electricity and magnetism for which all the other idiots failed and i did pretty well in the second module the other students just barely passed we are now approaching the final exam in weeks here is where the pro revenge story begins for the entire physics course the labs weigh of the actual grade there are experiments in total and we have to submit the lab report of all reports at the end of the semester i had other final year students in my group and not one of them would ever help out during experiments i would literally do the entire lab alone and they would pretend to work whenever the instructor passed by you know what it doesnt bother me sometimes while im working on an experiment one of them would poke me or slap the back of my head as a joke still doesnt bother me much i can laugh it off whatever but what gets to me is that after weeks of you guys slacking you message me to complete all the lab reports by myself and refuse to work telling me you didnt let us help you so we dont know what to do oh that got to me i gave you guys a simple task of just plotting graphs with the different data that i had already collected and you refused to do it last week was the final day for submission for all the labs i didnt submit a single one today we all got a out of for the lab components where labs module exam module exam module exam quizzes the beauty of this is that even though i lost i can still pass they cant the subject is offered only once per year in order to graduate now they have to wait an entire year tldr lab group members refused to help in lab i didnt submit any report and failed everyone and have them repeat an entire year edit for the people who ask why i would sacrifice my own grade a it doesnt affect my wam im still graduating with a distinction b when i meet them later on i can just say oh i didnt submit the lab because you didnt submit the graphs to me c if i rat them out to the professor and i get a good grade they tell everyone that i intentionally failed them its a small university this way instead of them blaming me they can blame themselves
i know im not the best story teller but here it goesthe story is posted in my post history its my first post since this is a throwaway im normally a huge pussy due to social anxiety and stuff like that so im really proud of this one heres the original story tldr for those who dont wanna read the previous post a kid i was referred to hes a stranger to me basically hooked me up and i trusted him as the middle man my money disappears unsurprisingly the kid stopped taking my calls stopped answering my texts so during my deep brooding at am in my bed i hatched a plan i know this kid is in highschool so he lives with his parents he never gave me his real address probably because he was planning on ripping me off from the beginning after some facebook stalking that came up inconclusive i could only find his cousins but i didnt want to ruin his life completely by messaging them that their cousin is a drug dealer and theif i checked yellowbooks all i gotta say is that yellowbooks should be illegal man i found his address crosschecked it with where i picked him up his real address is one street over so i knew it was legit and more importantly his home phone number so i sent him a simple text i said i know you have my money please return it or i will call your parents he didnt reply after a bit i sent him his address saying is this correct i know i sounded threatening but i apologized to his mother later on saying that i didnt mean to sound threatening he says no well obviously he would say that so i just told him id see him later i asked if his parents are home before and he said he lives alone which is bullshit and that he and his guys would be ready to throw down i told him that i dont wanna fight and that just wanna talk i gave him his chance and he had up until now to return my money i believe in second chances but he forced my hand so when i got home from classes i called his mother im a very respectful and polite person naturally so i made was positive i could talk to his mother about this i call ask if this is the kid who robbed mes residence and told his mom that id like to talk to her about his sons behavior i told her that i have evidence that he stole from me i took screenshots of everything and that i approached her because i wanted to settle this as peacefully and as quickly as possible i explained the situation and told her that she should change her sons phone number because i easily could have been an undercover cop and that i got both his name and phone number from someone whos basically a total stranger to the kid who robbed me she thanked me and i told her that i didnt want to do this but i was left with no options i promised her i wasnt a thug and just a normal person i said that he was lucky that it was me who he robbed because other people might have attempted to hurt him which was the recommendation of a lot of people from other posts but i left that part out i sent her the messages that showed he threatened me and i said that i hate violence which i do and that i felt that this was the best way to effectively deal with the situation i left out the part of me wanting to buy an ounce because that would have scared her quite a bit if she knew how much it was but she gave me her phone number and told me itll be sorted out and that hell lose his car immediately she tells me to block his number i thank her she thanks me and i tell her that her son seemed like a good person but i was still robbed nonetheless i get a text minutes later from the kid saying fuck you you stupid fuck and i block his number i wont be getting my cash back for a while since im taking a family vacation for a few weeks but she promised me ill get my cash back at this point i didnt even care too much about the money all i wanted was revenge that sweet sweet justice boner feels soooo good as i was feeling depressed and feeling like shit at am dj khaled got me through and it was these words that helped me create my plan never play yourself
this all took place many years ago when i was a freshman in high school i had bought an ipod nano hot shit back then with money i had earned by helping my neighbor and as i didnt make much i was pretty protective of it my scumbag sister had also recognized that it was worth a few hundred as i later found out she had stolen it and given it to a friend temporarily until the heat was off i suspected this immediately when it wasnt on my desk where i knew i left it i asked my parents if i had done something that warranted a punishment but neither had touched it clearly i needed evidence to pin my sister as a freshman i was pretty computer savvy at the time i was learning a few programming languages and had a good feel for novice hacking nothing serious but enough to get in trouble at school kinda thing i got to work on a spy tool my plan was to get into her email and facebook where i hoped to find evidence at the very least i could fuck up her account and get revenge a few hours of work later the program was done and it was way more than a simple spy tool although i honestly had no idea how to make a spy tool at the time i damn sure knew how to write a batch file that would fuck your windows partition six ways to sunday i had basically written a carpet bomb that had the same icon as internet explorer the virus can i call it that was armed when you replaced the default iexploreexe file with the malicious file that shared the same file name and icon of course when you went to run ie you set it off the original file would be launched after the virus ran so everything was still usable of course my original goal was still carried out i had packaged in a simple keylogger records keystrokes that any decent antivirus would have noticed instantly but once my sister was out of the house there was nothing stopping me from ripping her antivirus out by the roots which i did and then planted the virus a few hours later she came home and started her normal computer browsing log in open ie check facebook and email this was before twitter i guess etc etc but today was a little different she probably didnt notice but internet explorer lagged a little when she opened it that was because internet explorer had to execute a few little things before it extracted and then launched the real browser application for instance a few files marked hidden with innocent names were copied to her startup folder waiting to execute at the next login the keylogger was embedded deep into the system and was started right up and within a minute her passwords were saved in a protected log file she was completely unaware of course that all changed in about minutes the virus which was running in the background ran a fake error message that caused a reboot there appears to be a beaver dam obstructing your flow of internet connection code red reboot required she was somehow stupid enough to not instantly realize that this was some sort of malwarespyware and just patiently waited for the login screen as soon as she logged back in the hidden startup files ran and she was greeted with some weird error message and importantlooking command prompt windows which were busy doing important things like deleting system files and corrupting huge registry chunks suddenly she was getting errors about things like her hard drive being jammed with peanut butter and windows has detected an intelligence deficit in user consider a system upgrade complete with an annoying beep noise every time she tried to close it her cd tray kept popping open no matter how many times she closed it she even got a snarky message put it in me babe every time it opened back up meanwhile in the background a small script uploaded the keylogger file to my ftp account and deleted the keylogging portion as well as the hidden startup files in case investigation was done naturally this triggered her mashing the power button and waiting for the screen to turn off she knew something wasnt right as soon as she had the login screen everything was x resolution at this point she asked me to come fix it because i was the computer nerd in the house i had to contain my laughter just try logging in this is really weird i have no idea why this would happen the desktop was a beautiful pixel collection featuring colors that was a lot a couple decades ago and barely distinguishable icons her theme was set to windows classic which she hates with a passion shes one of those people who spends hours customizing the look of the icons cursors and other piddlyass things unfortunately for her i had plans with friends and couldnt help her with her computer sorry about that all program files and hardware drivers were gone so she had no luck running a browser amidst the chaos or even getting an internet connection in the first place in the end i got my ipod i spoke to her the next day and asked for it back naturally she claimed not to have it she didnt know that i had read her facebook messages and already knew that her friend had it she and her friend were messaging about how to turn it off or something i asked my parents right in front of her can you ask her to show her facebook messages just so she can clear herself i thought i heard her saying something to her friend about the ipod and how she would talk about it on facebook sure enough she broke down and said that she was just borrowing it obviously my parents forced her to show the messages which clearly proved how it was a little more than borrowing that she had in mind my dad recommended that she have someone fix her laptop luckily i was around to do it and for i would be happy to reinstall windows and that ladies and gentlemen was how i got even with my sister i am so sorry this is a goddamn novel but i hope you enjoyed it edit clarified a few things
when i was a sophomore in college i got a job as a waitress at a restaurant near campus it was a pretty small place so servers often helped out with other things like dishwashing and cleaning there were a lot of callouts it was a restaurant after all and i was willing to pick up the hours because money so within a few months i had gotten used to doing everything and i do mean everything seating tables dishpit running register even some prep and other things on the line i had gotten so good at other things that i was put on the schedule for other stations if there were any gaps i busted my everloving butt for that place all without ever losing my smile and after a while it began to show the managers loved me my coworkers loved me the customers loved me it seemed like just about everyone enjoyed working with me well almost everyone the kitchen manager henceforth known as crazy bitch was not my biggest fan to put it mildly she was nice enough at first but began to grow cold and distant as time wore on and eventually became outright hostile she was bitchy to everyone but seemed to take pleasure in going above and beyond with me a few examples of what she did to me include but are not limited to throwing dishes into the pit while i was washing breaking them she ran to the manager and tried to blame me telling the front end manager to stay in the office with me when i counted my drawer my drawer was never off the whole time i worked there telling new hires to watch out for me constantly dissing me behind my back to others which i always found out about because people liked me forcing me to stay later than i already did to deep clean various things in the kitchen throwing away my timeoff requests when she thought no one was watching in general this woman did everything she could to tarnish my name and make my life unpleasant she was the only bad thing about working at this restaurant and at times it got so frustrating that i went home and cried the only person she didnt whine to about me was the owner and thats only because she was scared of him he had five other locations around town and he just went around to each one throughout the week this will come into play later on ive always been an introvert who shied away from confrontation and this resulted in me keeping my mouth shut and putting up with crazy bitchs antics far longer than i should have now ten years later i would have told her where to go from day one but college sophomore me was shy besides this was a temporary job and i just kept reminding myself that i was going to get a degree and move on eventually to set the scene crazy bitch had been particularly nasty to me over the past week and i was extrastressed because it was midterms i think it was these two factors that led to me finally snapping at crazy bitch i had just walked in for my shift and was chatting with some coworkers when crazy bitch walked up to me she asked me why under the ovens werent clean i said i didnt know she said that she had asked me to clean under them last night which absolutely wasnt true because i had left two hours before closing the previous night i could feel the rage building inside me i was about to blow up not wanting a confrontation i just shrugged my shoulders well crazy bitch said i wish you would do a better job of cleaning around here something inside me snapped i screamed you motherfucking piece of shit as loud as i could crazy bitch jumped about ten feet in the air and had eyes as big as saucers when she landed it was now dead quiet in the kitchen you could hear a pin drop and all eyes were on me and crazy bitch i jabbed my finger into her chest and said if you complain about me one more time i will give you something to complain about well its true crazy bitch replied alright then i quit i flung my name tag and apron in her face walked out of the kitchen and walked straight out the door never to return the kicker i was scheduled to do the dishpit that evening with me gone crazy bitch would have no choice but to either pull someone off the line and screw up the whole dinner service or to do it herself perhaps the story would have ended there but things were about to go from petty to pro i got a slew of phone calls that evening from former coworkers this was long before social media asking me what happened telling me how much they would miss me andor congratulating me on finally standing up to crazy bitch one phone call was the manager asking me what happened and i gave my side of things and apologized for quitting in such an abrupt fashion i heard what happened the next day from my former coworkers it just so happened that it was the day that the owner was due to stop by and check on things upon arriving and looking around he asked where i was since i had worked almost every day for nearly a year he was informed that i had quit and that naturally led to him asking why well everyone told him crazy bitch was due to come in for her shift a little after the owner arrived when she showed up he was waiting for her by the timeclock he told her that under no circumstances was she to punch in effective immediately she was suspended she had three days to give him a written letter offering an explanation regarding her behavior towards one of the best employees hes ever had his words not mine and if he didnt find it sufficient she was barred from ever working at a location he owned ever again so crazy bitch goes home writes up an explanation i still sometimes wonder what she wrote and brings it in the next day the owner reviewed it and told crazy bitch that after a weeks suspension without pay she was allowed to come back and work for him as a dishwasher i dont know which is funnier the fact that she was demoted or the fact that she was desperate enough for a job that she took him up on the offer crazy bitch went from being in charge of everyone behind the kitchen doors to being a minimum wage dishwasher it gets better a few months later sales were down and in the restaurant business it is notoriously hard to turn a profit the owner decided to close the location next to campus but was kind enough to offer everyone positions at his other locations well everyone except one there is an epilogue of sorts to this story a few years later i was shopping at the grocery store when i felt a tap on my shoulder i turned around and felt my stomach drop when i saw who it was it was crazy bitch to my surprise she apologized for how she had treated me she said she was going through a divorce at the time and didnt handle it very well taking it out on the people she worked with i accepted her apology and she gave me an awkward little hug before going on her way so i guess despite the awful shit she pulled towards me she wasnt so bad after all
appetizer about six years ago i started my own consulting business i am a talented engineer but i wasam sadly nave about the ways of the world i came from a nice loving suburban background and my parents taught me that all people are fundamentally good inside they are not to quote dr cox people are bastard coated bastards with bastard filling in most cases i never got any sort of revenge eventually i realize im being screwed and i fire the individualcut the contract etc and take it as a lesson learned and move on with my life main course except this one time when i hired a sales guy we will call this sales guy tony tony swept in to my office on a cloud of amazing promises he had a resume a mile long and many harrowing unlikely yet somehow plausible stories of his great sales success in past organizations he wanted to partner with me to take my company to a new level make more money than weve ever made before etc etc even better tony didnt even want a salary he simply wanted to be able to take out loans from the company until his big sales pipeline kicked in and then he would pay it all back from his giant commissions it was a total winwin for everybody involved this sounded like an amazing deal what a nice guy and clearly confident he could close a lot of sales or why else would he forgo a salary in favor of loans i think friends its probably obvious how this story goes over the course of the next year tony almost made so many huge sales that are totally ready to sign but somehow never quiet came through and in that time he took out over in loans that he would totally pay back as soon as his monster sales finally came through finally after so many big promises with zero results i became suspicious so i hacked open his company email account and saw that in fact he had never sent an email to a client ever in fact the only emails he ever sent were to me and other people in my business talking himself up all of his leads were utterly fake he had never talked to a single client a single time in a year dessert so i fired him and set about seeing what sort of revenge i could extract first i went to my lawyer who told me what i expected no legal routes existed to go after him that wouldnt cost me way more than i wanted to spend on revenge second i hired a pi to dig into him turns out surprise surprise that lots of people are after this guy former business partners hospitals in florida some big medical thing he skipped out on and a few others it was finally my accountant who showed me the best way to get back at him without spending a lot of time or money as i mentioned he took out all of his pay from me as loans now that id spoken with the lawyer and the pi i knew i had essentially a zero percent chance of ever recovering that money from him so i did the next best thing to benefit my business and to screw him over i forgave the loans in their entirety this had two huge impacts first i got a tax write off because the loans were now bad debt which reduced my tax bill for to zero a small but happy victory second he now owes the irs you see when i forgave the loan it became income to him once it becomes income full income taxes including federal state payroll social security medicare etc become due and payable because its not payroll income i dont have to pay the employer portion of the taxes this means he owes the irs that he can never escape through bankruptcy or any other means and i have the worlds most vicious attack dog trying to get money from him instead of whatever minor debt collection efforts i could have mustered tldr my friend was raped last month i found out where the perv lived and sharpened the edges of the elevator doors in his building to a razors edge one day when he came out of the elevator looking all rapey i slammed the doors shut and cut him in half i kept his scalp as a trophy

so you be the judge of whether this is pro revenge or petty revenge unlike my past post the stakes here are small but it was done in a professional context my job i own and manage several midsize multifamily rental properties apartment blocks im very hands on and i deal with most day to day issues as well as the investment side great returns this way i choose most of the tenants personally and most of them are great people they appreciate my handson work and the fact i love my job and strive to provide the customer service that a good hotel would there are some exceptions one of my tenants is a charming young woman with a good job friendly and easygoing demeanour and a total douchebag boyfriend it was a sixmonth battle to get him on the lease since he lives there fulltime now and from what i see doesnt contribute to rent not my problem though until i get a call from him politely odd hes not usually polite saying he clogged the toilet and asks if i can call a plumber or fix it before his girlfriend gets home happy that he is being polite i went on over and was there in minutes it turned out he had dropped a bottle of hair gel into the bowl and for some reason flushed it it was jammed in the ptrap of the bowl just out of sight but within reach i got on my elbowgloves reached in and pulled it out he stood watching me with this scumbag steve smirk on his face i suggested that next time he just reach in and grab it himself before calling me he looked me dead in the eye and said i dont reach into toilets dude im going to school so i dont have to touch other peoples shit i told him youd be surprised how much that pays though you bill will be in the mail i went home called three plumbing contractors and asked them each what their emergency service rate was the average was for the first minutes flat i sent a bill to scumbag tenant for he refused to pay i filed a dispute at the tenancy office and included in my evidence the three quotes i had received i got my judgement today plus the filing fee a ll is allowed to charge market rate to repair damage that a tenant causes intentionally or through negligence now he knows that next time he will reach into the toilet himself all he had to do was keep his dumb mouth shut and i would have fixed his problem for free
so this will be a wall of text so be warned but the story works best if you read it all the way through when i was fifteen or so a girl georgia started picking on a friend and i it started out with taunting teasing and insults but when we failed to react it escalated she eventually resorted to punching us kicking us slapping us slamming our heads down on desks every time she walked past us in lessons jabbing us with sharpened pencils from behind and once or twice she even got her posse to help out with a beating or two we were shy girls who often attracted bullies because we were introverted and could come across as aloof because socialising wasnt our strong suit my friend and i usually had lessons apart from each other so when georgia went for us we were usually separated and she wouldnt take us on together even though we never fought back however one day my friend had enough and said that shed be leaving school before the next term she said she couldnt take it any more and wanted to leave i was really upset by this because with my best friend leaving being left alone with my bully and teenage angst all adding up i ended up with depression my friend confirmed not long after that that her parents had agreed and she would be leaving but she said she had a plan to go out with a bang now this was the time before iphones and smartphones just but we both had laptops with webcams our plan began with taking our laptops everywhere we went and always having our laptops on and always having our webcams on we even painted over the little lights that show the webcam is working so that georgia would never know we started using our laptops at all times we got special permission to use them in lessons me by claiming carpal tunnel syndrome which was a lie and her by saying she wrote too slowly which was true every time we went to a lesson we were recording on our computers and sure enough we got the footage of georgias abuse we got a friend to splice the videos together in a sort of compilation video to blur our faces but not georgias and to burn the final cut onto a disc for us the final video started out with georgia walking past me and slamming my face down into the desk it then cut to her calling me a worthless cunt and then again to her spraying ink on my friends uniform then it showed a variety of slaps punches and headlocks before switching to a close up of her with her arm around my friend speaking very quietly about how she was going to wait until the bell rang and then kick the shit out of her the video was just under fifteen minutes long and displayed everything she did except for the beatings that sometimes happened outside of lessons so the day my friend left we hugged and promised to keep in contact we then nodded to one another as she got into her mums car and was driven off that night georgias mother got a cd in the post as did our headmaster as did the police they all watched it though it took the police longer to get to it georgia was suspended but once the video magically made its way to every member of the parents association she was expelled she applied to other schools but they had seen the video too in the end she was sent abroad to finish her education you may ask how we know all this well not long after coming up with the plan my friend and i made a fake facebook profile and added georgia she accepted it and forgot about it she was one of those people even when facebook was fairly new who posted about everything that happened to her so a post that said georgia is seriously pissed about being shipped off to insert foreign school name here was enough for us to send them a copy of the video too of course she knew it was us but since she was sent off to another country she couldnt exactly do anything about it occasionally i check out her facebook and she is not doing well as an adult maybe she shouldnt have pushed two nice girls too far edit i can see you guys are wanting to see the video itself i promise i will think about it but it isnt just up to me i would have to ask my friend and since the school uniform is easily identifiable i am not sure if there would be some legal issues here edit asked my friend if shed be ok with me uploading the video to reddit her response was whats a reddit edit ok guys ive sent a message to a friend who is doing law to see if i could get in any trouble for sharing the video when it clearly shows the uniform and takes place in the school ill take their advice on the matter edit my friend says shes happy to let me share the video so well just see what my law friend says 
posted on obvious throwaway account my main account is tied into my personal information and business forgive vagueness here as i dont want any repercussions back in college i got very interested in a business which ill call widgeting it was closely associated with my major and i studied it at length coming up with an idea which i felt could revolutionize widgeting which was fairly stagnant the problem is widgeting is a small field governed by a good old boys network and rarely does anyone get in who isnt a relative of existing widgeters i was doubly unlikely to break in because i was a woman knowing this i got a sales job out of college which supplied among other things widgeters this put me in close contact with a number of widgeters and let me feel out better if my ideas would fit as well as i originally thought increasingly confident in my idea i was asked to run the stand for widget supply company at a trade show while there i met the man who had just taken over ownership of widgeting usa easily one of the most renowned companiesmr doe was younger and i had read a local interview with him where he was talking about embracing new ideas he seemed a great pitch for my idea which i had on my personal laptop earlier i had been in a conversation with several other people and mr doe so we had established a contact then that evening mr doe and i were on the same elevator as a few other people and we started friendly chatting about his business etc im looking to move conversation to my idea when others get off the elevator leaving mr doe and i alone he instantly started getting aggressively grabby on me touching me inappropriately and saying that i should come up to his hotel room i push him off and tell him im not interested and he shoves me back and sort of gets aggressive then gets off the elevator and stomps away the next morning im at the trade show talking to another vendor who calls over to mr doe he asks if we have met and i say yes mr doe says no as he turns to leave he leans in and says quietly enough for only i to hear i dont bother remembering women unless theyve had my dick in their mouth later i start hearing stories from other people of similar assaults and issues with women who have done business with him or had social contact with him no one had pursued criminal charges but he had a reputation i wasnt aware of as a creep flash forward a bit and i meet a group interested in investing in their own widgeting company i pitch them my idea they loves it and we move forward with me as a partial partner my idea actually works well and we are making a name for ourselves as a young company my business partners and i are invited to a city event which is semi formal arriving there i see mr doe in the corner holding his wifes hand i manage to avoid him for most of the night but i find myself fixing my lipstick in the bathroom mirror when mr does wife comes up beside me i couldnt resist i asked if she was mrs doe and she says that she is and asks if we had met i tell he we hadnt but i met her husband were making pleasant talk social talk and walk back out together and mr doe comes over to us he introduces himself and i say that weve met i give my name and that i am one of the partners at new widgeting co at this point he starts sort of schmoozing me saying he has heard of me and that i was behind the business plan he is really impressed at how well it is working but thinks it would work better on a larger scale if i want to jump ship to an established company he could use some new blood and fresh ideas after a bit of this he asks where we met before as he cant place me but he never forgets a face with his wife standing there i tell him that we met at x trade show in smarch of theres a moment of realization on his face and not able to resist i turn to his wife its not surprising he cant remember me he told me then that he only remembers women if theyve had his dick in their mouth i quickly make my leave and watch from across the room as his wife and he have a minor confrontation in the corner no raised voices but a lot of gesturing wide eyed head shaking ending in tears on her part they left the party early a few days later i get an email sent to my work address from her asking what i meant by the comment i reply back from my personal email account and outline exactly what had happened i also add that she can contact the following women with similar stories later it also proved he had two fairly stable mistresses as well one who was only its two years since then my company has grown to be a solid rival of his while his has been struggling this is partially because he was investing his own money into instituting new technology into widgeting usa sadly he financially was hurt when his wife divorced him she and i have become surprisingly good friends and shell joke about the lack of pre nuptial agreement tldr sexual assault is always a bad idea but it will ruin you when your victim is a better businessperson than you are and your wife can wipe the floor with you
this is a story about my uncles vengeance my uncle is chill and friendly but he once had the misfortune of living next to an awful neighbor the guy actually didnt have a ton of bad habits but he did exactly what he wanted to do and he didnt care who it affected and one of the things he wanted to do was take his big dog on a daily morning walk and let the dog do his doggy business on my uncles lawn the first time my uncle caught him he calmly confronted him and politely requested that the neighbor stop using his lawn as a dog toilet the neighbor calmly told my uncle to get fucked he didnt care what my uncle thought there was nothing my uncle could do about it and nothing would change this being s southern california my uncle couldnt record the neighbor and shame him online or report him to the police for some litter violation and although he is a cool uncle he was in no way physically intimidating enough to get this guy to back down every day for a week he went outside to confront the shitty neighbor and his shitting dog and every day he got the exact same answer fuck off i dont care and theres nothing you can do about it on the eight morning my uncle stayed inside watching as the neighbor yet again allowed his dog to leave a fudgy dump on his lawn then after the neighbor and his dog had continued on their walk my uncle grabbed a shovel and went outside he scooped up the dog shit and with masterful accuracy flung it onto the roof of the neighbors house as mentioned before this being s california the neighbors roof like all of the houses in that area had a very shallow slope and once he saw that the poop didnt roll off my uncle headed back inside he repeated the exact same procedure every morning for the next eight months not once did the neighbor notice the steadily growing pile of dog shit on his roof baking and dehydrating in the california sun not once did he smell anything off nor did he find it suspicious that my uncle still greeted him in a friendly manner after having his lawn used as a dog loo every single morning finally after eight months the hot and sunny weather gave way to a massive rainstorm within minutes the entire crusty layer of dog poop shingles rehydrated and broke free a reeking mudslide from hell that sloshed down onto the neighbors property splattering his lawn his house and his car with literal pounds of dog shit over the next few days the neighbors grass succumbed to the poison and died paint began to flake off his car and the neighbor himself had to finally clean up after his dog once the sunny weather returned and the remnants of the dog poonami began to dry up while still stubbornly stuck to every stinking corner of his house tragically my uncle didnt take any pictures of the poohouse i would have loved to have seen that from the day after the rainstorm to the day my uncle moved out of that house he never spoke to that neighbor again but the dog poop stopped appearing on his lawn for good
when i was in high school my first car was a cheap little geo that id bought with money id saved working my ass off at the neighborhood pizza joint obviously it was nothing special but it was mine and i was proud of it i lived in a very affluent suburb in the midwest at the time though and a majority of my peers drove much nicer cars either daddys bmw or a bmw daddy bought for them i mean everyone else didnt literally drive bmws exclusively but you get the idea anyway i was a junior at the time and there were a handful of bullies seniors who decided that because i drove a dated inexpensive car i deserved to be subjected to constant ridicule and harrassment i was constantly being called poor and laughed at for driving such a cheap piece of shit in reality my family was actually decently well off my parents couldve bought me a brand new mercedes if theyd wanted but they came from nothing and wanted me to earn my first car and being raised by them i was fine with that anyway lets call the leader of this bullying group tad tad was utterly obnoxious to almost everyone around him but usually got away with it because he was a attractive b a straighta student and c a talented player on every sports team our high school offered the whole conflict started one day after school i was in my little geo in the line of cars waiting to leave the parking lot tad was in front of me in his audi a when we were nearing the parking lot exit tad stopped to lean out the window and chat to some of his friends i had work at the pizzeria that day and was in a hurry so being impatient i sped around him tad mustve interpreted my passing him as some sort of hostile affront to his ego and sped up behind me after finally turning onto the main road he stayed right on my bumper and followed me to work when i got out of my car he leaned out the window and called me some names i ignored him and went into work when i got out of work hours later i found both of my mirrors broken i didnt have proof but i knew it was tad luckily my parents felt bad for me and paid for me to have them fixed that week next week however came the straw that broke the camels back it was a friday and id stayed late after school working on a history paper in the school library i happened to get out right after the lacrosse team had finished up practice when i came out to the parking lot i saw tad standing next to my car what was he doing taking a piss on the drivers side door filled with rage i ran after him but he managed to get to his car and peel out of the parking lot at home feeling defeated as i washed his piss off my car i decided revenge was in order i didnt know how yet but i knew an opportunity would come and it did two weeks later word had spread around the school that this senior named doug was having a big party the coming weekend doug was incredibly popular and i knew tad would be there i also happened to know tad would be driving his audi there and i knew where doug lived and that most of the people tad included would be staying the night i enrolled the help of my two closest friends ben and josh both hated tad just as much as i did though for different reasons and were more than eager to lend their help when i told them my scheme the night of the party we waited until am when we knew the party would be dead and everyone would be sleeping we showed up wearing all dark clothes and plastic gloves we found tads car and much to our amazement and glee hed left it unlocked we opened the doors and quietly went to work trying to keep from laughing too loudly first i pissed into the air vents i got out and josh pissed all over the leather drivers seat then it was bens turn now let me tell you ben is a disgusting human being hes a loud funny guy all smiles and laughter but hes also just gross constantly belching and farting and it always smells so so rancid when he does hes the type of dude who takes pride in that ben pulls down his pants whispers i wonder if hell be able to tell i had chinese food squats next to the car and proceeds to take a shit into his gloved hand the smell is immediately overwhelming and horrifyingly gruesome its so potent you can taste it josh and i gag right away frantically pulling our shirts over our noses and retreating from bens vicinity josh cant take it runs over to a tree and pukes his guts out ben laughs and says oh my god that is sick sorry while were watching from a distance in both horror and amusement ben takes his shit and just starts smearing it everywhere all over the door handles the steering wheel the air vents the radio knobs he eventually starts gagging and coughing and retreats himself but not before wiping his ass with the lacrosse jersey tad had left in the back seat we couldnt stop laughing on the walk back to joshs house but once we were back josh made ben take a shower thank god the following monday there were a lot of whispers going around the school heres what i eventually learned happened the morning after the party tad discovered the nightmare in his audi in front of everyone else who was leaving tad went into a rage but apparently almost everyone thought it was the funniest thing they had ever seen when tads parents discovered what happened to the car theyd purchased for their son they also discovered tad had been to a party and had been drinking i guess his parents were not cool with it they took away his car for the rest of the year and tad was told he had to ride the bus for the remainder of the year his parents eventually gave him the car back several months later but no one wanted to ride in the shitmobile because of what happened and because he never got the smell completely out tads bullying surprisingly died down a bit after that he didnt mess with my car again tldr bully in high school smashes both of my mirrors and pisses on my car me and my friends unleash a torrent of shit and piss all over the inside of his and his once cool audi came to be known throughout school as the shitmobile
cross posted from tifu after mods took it down i received a bunch of surprising comments thanks to whoever gave me gold i was shocked edit holy jesus thanks for all the comments and ups and special thanks to uihatecraptcha for the gold you guys have been amazing definitely makes me want to post more often thanks again original post obliged to say this happened in when i was in th grade and this is my first tifu i was a nerdy kid coming from a military family i had friends sure but kind of a loner and tended to stay by myself in the lunch room actively avoided group projects you know the usual type of growing up an outcast type of thing there was this kid in my same class lets call him sam now i never had a problem with sam in the past i remember seeing him for the first time in rd grade and we got along fine i didnt bother him he didnt bother me i continue reading my nintendo powers until the teacher tells me to stop slacking it was all fine until fifth grade th grade was a turning point for sam he had hit some sort of brutish growth spurt and started pushing people around he eyed me as an easy target this all started in the beginning of the school year and continued for five months it began with flicking bits of paper ok whatever big deal it stopped for a while then paper clips and rubber bands ow but no marks so no need to tell anyone not that i would have anyway being the awkward antisocial boy i was sam soon stopped and raised the bar of bulliness by talking shit to me the usual early s jabs were used and silently rebuffed he knocked my food down onto the floor sam however never got in trouble he was the sneakiest of the sneaks he was the shadow of the elementary school sam got away with everything due to adults either not seeing it happen or not caring so its early february and its the end of pe class i make it to the coveted front of the line and await my classmates for the best part of school the library as the rest of the class lines up behind me here comes sam he barrels through to the front of the line shoving me out of the way by this point ive hit my breaking point i must have watched rocky iv the night before i decided this would be the time to take my stand against the evil oppressor i hear the battle cry in my head as i defy this bully and impose myself by shoving him back what a feeling why did i wait so long sam pushes me hard im shocked no one should have to give up their front of the line status i was the one who made it first who haphazardly tied his shoes to make it in time i was the one who deserves this spot of spots in the line that every other th grader desired i push sam back at this point sam is absolutely shocked his eyes are wide and full of disdain the redness of anger is flooding his skin sam punches me in the eye hard i drop like a burlap sack tears are flowing and im sobbing im crouched on my knees and sam laughs at me just laughs straight guffaws each staccato laugh just makes me see red im pissed this kid just punches me in the eye and i go down this is not how the movies show these situations to be this is not how rocky would happen my classmates are laughing at my disgrace sam is still laughing tongue sticking out and just rubbing it in my face that im crying so i yelled out as loudly as i could the war cry that echoed in my head i stick my fist straight up and with eyes closed so tight i give this kid the hardest punch i can muster i uppercut him in the jaw so hard i broke my middle finger my eyesight returns and i look at him hes on the floor screaming and crying in a bloody mess about five feet away i see a bloody fleshy glob of unknown sam is holding his mouth and i put together i just punched sam so hard he cut off his own tongue with his teeth sam is wailing in agony the gym teacher runs up and forces me to the side wall while an ambulance is called for sam i didnt feel bad at all the amount of pain and anguish this kid put me through was equivalent to the pain that he was going through the ambulance took him away and i was straight to the principals office with an ice pack to my eye im awaiting punishment outside the office while my dads called while waiting my classmates who saw the whole exchange spoke with the principal one by one finally my mother and father arrive with a mix of disappointment caring and anger on their faces i finally get pulled into the principals office with my parents and tell them my side of the story i tell them the whole ordeal from the beginning of the year to the present the principal and my parents stay quiet with the most stoic faces you have ever seen its dead silence for what seems like an eternity before the principal speaks up son i am extremely disappointed in how you handled the situation you are suspended for a week due to the end result of your actions i dont remember the rest of what he said by that point my middle finger was swollen to what looked like a bratwurst and i just wanted the day to end my parents escorted me out of the school brought me to the hospital to mend my finger during the ride to the hospital my parents told me they were proud of me for standing up for myself so i wouldnt be punished at home i spent that week watching bugs bunny cartoons with an ice pack on my eye and a smile on my face i never saw sam again i remember rumors that he switched to a different school in the area as an adult i feel bad for the amount of damage i did to him but that little th grade nerd boy still in me is still glad that the wrongs have finally been righted tldr got in a fight after being bullied for half a school year got tired of it and uppercutted the bullys tongue from his mouth

im calling this pro revenge because of the amount of work involved but weve decided the work was worth it for nearly years my family has lived next door to a gentleman who lived alone ours is an historic neighborhood double city lots with lots of hedges bushes and trees to provide privacy also i tend to be fairly easygoing about what others do on their own property i really didnt care when our neighbor began illegally storing his large toys in his backyard due to the screening i was the only neighbor who had to see his boats ice house teepee yes a fullsized authentic teepee i never asked why he put one up and so i never complained and when he turned his home into a duplex without benefit of building permits or inspections and in violation of current zoning again i never complained i guessed he was now retired and needed the rent money in any event weve never had a problem with any of his tenants similarly we never heard a peep out of him regarding our property not that we had any code violations or anything but we did have a yard full of loud children and dogs for many years and there was that one winter when we built a luge for the neighborhood kids that ran the entire fence line of our yards anyhoo then our neighbor got a new girlfriend im going to call my neighbor dragged around by my dick or dick for short his girlfriend will hereinafter be referred to as martha as she was a martha stewart wannabe martha quickly moved into my neighbors home and began altering it as she saw fit the first thing we noticed was that dicks neon sign collection was no longer visible through his windows ahh those bygone bachelor days then dicks backyard toys were all sold no more carefree days spent fishing for dick im guessing the proceeds went to the new patio furniture that soon appeared also a second new patio was built onto the side of the house because the backyard patio got too much sun for marthas taste and since martha didnt want dicks cat spraying the new patio furniture she made dick give the cat away to his son that last one made me a little sad the cat had been dumped in our neighborhood a few years back and dick had seemed happy to have his little friend but again not our business finally new landscaping was installed throughout their backyard that also made me sad because the historic plantings that helped make our neighborhood unique were ripped out and replaced with mcmansionstyle beds filled with wood shavings and japanese maples if that was all martha did id have no real problem if dick was willing to put up with it why should i care right but then she turned her attentions to our yard first she asked us to replace the historic wire fencing between our yards dick offered to split the cost so we agreed the old fencing had seen better days and the new chain link fence was quickly hidden by ivy and lilac bushes good neighbors ok then martha decided that we werent cleaning up after our dog quick enough and called out the compliance officer in fact we picked up after our dog daily but at the end of each day not after each dump thats a personal ickfactor of mine i cant stand picking up warm poop the compliance officer told martha we hadnt violated any laws while giving me a heads up on my new neighbor strike one a few weeks later i had a knock at the front door it was the landscaper who had done dicks yard martha had called them out to my address without my knowledge or consent to provide us with an estimate estimate for what you ask well martha had suggestions for new flower beds as well as some trees she thought i should remove because they cast too much shadow on the back half of her yard these were twostory tall year old oak trees i apologized to the landscaper and sent him on his way and my husband grumbled to dick that our yard was our business not marthas strike two finally martha decided our gardening shed tucked behind our garage had to go ill admit it was a rather utilitarian shed but it was in good shape fresh paint and was heavily screened on all three sides by tall bushes in fact i only learned about marthas complaint because i found a city inspector wandering around my yard looking for the shed because of the way it was situated the only way someone not actually in my house could see it was if they were hanging out dicks secondstory bathroom window i kicked the inspector off my property and called my councilman to put a stop to the citys partnership with martha it was then i found out why martha wanted the shed gone turns out martha really just wanted the screening bushes gone she had plans for a third patio and fire pit for the back half of dicks yard martha was worried however that the heavy bushes on the back half of our yard were encouraging mosquitoes and she and dick wouldnt be able to properly enjoy their evenings by the fire she figured that if she forced us to tear down our shed wed then also tear down the screening bushes and her mosquito problem would be solved strike three martha so time for some pro revenge since we really didnt use the shed any longer we tore it down we also removed the screening bushes then we watched martha spend a few days harassing a couple of handymen who built her patio and fire pit it was snugged up right against our fence and looked really lovely then we decided that as good citizens of planet earth we needed to be more environmentally proactive so we installed a composting pile right where the shed and screening bushes had been located after all its at the back of our yard and tucked behind the garage so it really doesnt impact our enjoyment of our yard and now every evening we take all our food scraps potato peelings coffee grounds egg shells watermelon rinds etc and add it to our large healthy compost heap every month or so we add some goat manure from our friends farm turns out goat manure is a cant miss addition for nitrogenrich compost some shredded newspaper doesnt really look good but it does help balance the carbon content late afternoons and early evenings about whenever martha lights a fire really one of us heads out to the composting and gives it a good turning after all a wellaired compost heap is a happy compost heap dick and martha never said anything even though compost heaps do add to mosquito populations tldr martha stewart convinced us to exchange our lilac bushes for a pile of garbage 
ok so time i parked my ford escape in the drive way on my step fathers side cause my mother had said she was almost home and not to park on her side well i forgot to move my car back over once she got home and my step father took offence to this instead of asking me to move my car like a rational human being he decides to ram his dodge ram into my escape and force it out of the way unfortunatly the bars i had on the front looked like this did far more damage to his truck than expected so i hear the racket and go to see what was causing the noise only to find my suv at the end of the driveway and him staring at the back end of his truck he then turns to me and says that as soon as he gets back from his errand i had better have the money to fix the damage well as soon as he left i called the cops and reported a hit and run gave them the licencse plate number and his discription i then called the insurance company and told them the same story gave them the licence plate bladabladabla so fast forward about an hour and a half my mom gets a call from my stepdad at the police station saying he needs to be picked up we have a huge screaming match as soon as he gets home which ended in him taking my car keys from me and claiming he was going to sell my suv to which i reply that the vehicle is in my name so he cant do shit oh btw there was next to no damage to my vehicle from the impact im just glad that he didnt have his trailer hitch on next morning suprise surprise my suv is gone so i confront my stepdad about it he looks me straight in the eye and says i told you i was going to sell the piece of shit and that is exactly what i did so while he was still glaring at me i pulled out my trusty phone and called the cops again this time to report a stolen vehicle as soon as i told the cops his name he took off running his truck was still in impound this time i go to the police station with my mother when the cops ask if i want to press charges i just told them if he gives me my suv back then no but if he refuses then yes yes i would like to press charges turns out he sold it to his brother ie he stashed it at his place until i payed for his truck cause the insurance company refused needless to say my mother and he were not married much longer after that tldr stepdad was an asshat rammed my suv out of his way demanded i pay for the damages i called the cops stepdad gets arrested for hit and run stepdad then steals suv and basicly tells me he did it i call cops again and back to the police station he goes mother and stepdad get divorced edit changed the beginning so it didnt sound like i was anwsering a question nobody asked
before i begin please note that ive worked in food service everyone involved in this story has worked in the food servicebar industry at some point in their lives and i am a strict or more tipper regardless of service so many things go wrong during a bad service experience that is either happenstance or coincidental that blaming the server is usually misguided at best and malicious at worst all that said this woman was a piece of work a few years ago i was involved with a theatre company as a director and actor sometimes id help out with their fundraising and we were gathering a committee together of about people to meet at a barrestaurant and chat through plans on a weeknight in queens to set the scene its a small bargrill probably about spots at the bar and tables the place was half full and our group accounted for about a third of the patrons in the joint most of us were drinking some of us were eating full meals and a couple people were only staying for a short while so they just had water or a soda the bartender was covering all the tables as well as the bar youd think that would make her busy but somehow it didnt faze her while we waited on refills and silverware she was content standing by the bar and talking to her friend the conversations with the friend would make it into the minute territory while all of us were doing our best to catch her eye when we needed another beer or someone new arrived i had two beers during the evening and i would have loved to have had four since we were there for a while when we were able to get her attention the bartender would shuffle over take an order from one person and turn to walk away when someone would stop her and say hold on sorry i need something as well she would sigh loudly and turn back all while rolling her eyes and cocking her head to the side as if to say fine she didnt write anything down she forgot drinks and meals and was just all around the worst server any of us ever had even after all this i was still planning on tipping the standard that is until she came over with the check after another long conversation with her friend at the bar threw it on the table and said loudly to our group the next time you guys come in here everybody has to order something before storming away we were all dumbstruck our group accounted for probably half the money running through the place that night and we would have been ordering a lot more from the bar if shed ever bothered to check on us the group decided unanimously to leave a shit tip none of us had ever been treated so poorly by a server i left a dollar or so most people left coins or nothing the high point of the evening was when we were on our way out she picked up the check off the table and yelled after us oh nice fine get the fuck out of here and never come back as everyone in the entire place turned and stared my friend went over to her and said ill tell you exactly why we gave you what we did but the bartender was having none of it continuing to scream fuck you get the fuck out the revenge that night i went onto every restaurant review site i could find yelp greasy spoon some local nyc sites you name it i told the story in as many characters as the sites would allow i was so steamed i had to vent somewhere i also found out the next day that multiple people from our group had done the same thing it felt satisfying enough at this point i only thought of it as a petty revenge but it soon became pro a few weeks later i was talking with a friend of mine who got hired at this bar i told him the story and he said that was you guys i asked him how he knew about the incident he told me that the bar owner took online reviews very seriously when he saw all the terrible reviews come in on the same night with the same story he knew exactly which bartender it was she was fired the next day tldr after receiving the rudest worst service and being treated like shit my group used social media to get revenge and improve our neighborhood bar its now one of my favorite places to go and the current staff is all very cool

years ago i had a nasty breakup with my ex of years we had a house dog no kids but overall plenty to fight about eventually so tired of it all i told her she could have the house she was in love with the place and wanted to die there i just wanted out the house was underwater on the mortgage since i had bought it just before the realestate crash i offered her k in order to get out of it with that she could pay down the loan and refinance it in her name i moved out years go by and she starts the refinancing process i moved times during this time to my parents and twice for work im finally buying a new house although i had all of my small stuff out of her place i still had a pile of tools some appliances and other misc things i left it all there because i didnt want to just leave her high and dry for essential stuff at this point she had years to replace it all the refinancing is finally going through and i gave her in cash asking her when i could come and pick up my stuff she says i can grab the tools after i give her the rest of the cash but the appliances and some other stuff were hers this was not what i had agreed to i refused to give her another penny she sued me in small claims court the judge went down the list of stuff i was asking for he asked my ex in each instance if she paid for or contributed to paying for any of it to her credit she told the truth that she had not paid a cent in total there was about k worth of appliances and other stuff the tools werent included because she said i was welcome to pick them up any time the judge said he had to do some math he ordered that i had to pay in addition to the i had paid and we were square that i could live with i asked when i could pick up my stuff the judge looked puzzled and said oh well its hers now pay up and you are square ms ex loved that and gets this huge smirk as were walking out of the courtroom i ask her when i can meet her to pick up my tools she just looks at me with a shiteating grin and asks what tools at this point i had spent years pandering to her to keep things civil and now that she didnt need me anymore she was trying to steal everything she could get her hands on and get out of dodge now the revenge ms ex worked in the healthcare industry and had access to medical records of course she abused that to screw with me when i started dating again she would pull up stuff and tell me to stay away from so and so for your own good she foolishly had this in writing over email so when she decided to outright steal from me all bets were off i reported her for a hippa violation and her ass was fired the next day her entire career was around that industry and she will never get work in it again she took my house dog and a hell of a lot of other stuff but were square now 
my mother was a horrible person as an example she once told me my father was going to die after hed had a heart attack but shed already found out from the doctor that he was going to be ok i was years old at the time and it was simply done to make me cry but in her later years she had codp and my sister and i who both hated her and had good reason to had to nurse her for years until she died my father had done the bulk of her caring until he passed away in these years she did her best to cause trouble for as many people as possible but mostly the two of us fortunatly for us we had worked out the ways shed try and would often be able to head her off at the pass we had a deal between us that if she went too far the offended party could take a break from looking after her and the other would pick up the slack for a few weeks until the air had cleared a bit in shed really offended my sisters youngest daughter so she took a break my mother then pulled a usual stunt she had when she felt she wasnt getting enough attention she starved herself until she was so ill she needed hospitalization i got a phone call from my sister one morning telling me our mother had phoned her and was so very ill and she wanted my sister to go to her house and wait with her for the doctor to come in other words she wanted attention my sister asked me to do it and i did but i decided to take a book and read it whilst i was there it was a very apt book that i picked simply to get revenge on her as i knew shed be too nosy not to ask what it was about it was a hardback book the title written very boldy on the cover when a child kills abused children who kill their parents i sat and read it for hours beside her sickbed until the doctor arrived after she saw the title she barely said a word the whole time the doctor arrived and told her she wasnt ill enough for hospital amazingly within a couple of days she was a lot better and she didnt pull that stunt again for about a year in i was having a break from her and she did the same thing to try to get my attention this time she went too far ended up with kidney failure and died whilst registering her death the offical asked if we needed any extra copies of her death certificate and i said only if you have a framing service 
so one of my brothers is adopted and is amazing he didnt get anything handed to him in life and hes seriously one of the hardest working people i know just as he was starting his own family he had even more financial burden due to some medical problems still somehow he managed to build half a house on some land my dad sold him he used the equity in that to get a second loan and finish it and he had to fight the bank for that even time goes on and he begins to do really well so he sells the first house he built at a profit and buys some land like acres in the midwest he lives in a rural area he likes to hunt and does some farming on the land but the house that was there when he bought it isnt ideal despite some major improvements and renovation so he builds a third house and puts the house up for sale he keeps the land around the house for hunting this is important later this is when one of his envious family members asks if he and his wife would consider selling them the house they can only qualify for something like half of what its worth but my brother is a fairly generous guy he agrees to sell the house to them at a rather hefty discount since theyre family im sure he felt some of their pain as well hed had his own difficulty back when he was starting out the bank agrees to loan them the money they cant go wrong its for way less than the property is worth and the deal is done a few short months go by hes driving by the property and spots a for sale sign he stops in and the husband explains that there were some things about the house they werent happy with so they were planning on selling it and buying a house more in town or something etc my brother explains that they got a sweet deal only because they were family and that hed appreciate them selling the house back to him for what he sold it to them for the husband basically closes the door on that and my brother leaves and he thinks about it im certain that the family members understood that they were getting a good deal because they were family and he was happier selling it to them with the understanding that they werent to take advantage of his good graces this is a guy by the way that manages big projects hes a really fair guy the stuff he does in construction probably half of you have driven over big bridges that go over rivers like the mississippi for example hes used to solving hard problems this one isnt that hard the next day he drives out with some fence in the back of his truck and the family members in the house wake up to some fence posts being driven into the ground the husband comes out whats going on he asks im just putting up some hog fence on my property dont worry its all on my land ill just go around your house here and put a gate in so you can get in and out the husband is a bit perplexed youre bringing in pigs and my brother was seriously set to do it too he had about lined up from a farmer down the road the husband goes back into the house a few minutes of discussion occur the next day they all meet at the bank and the deed is transferred back to my brother and he didnt even have to deploy the hogs tldr family tries to take advantage of my brother on a real estate deal he threatens them with living in pig shit
i was originally going to post this as a comment to a story in petty about the inappropriate use of a roommates kitchen utensils but as i wrote it out i realized it bit too severe for pettyrevenge i had a roommate in college who was a nightmare she always tore up my dishes my pots and pans used my shampoo wore my jeans never asked permission just walked into my room and took whatever she wanted she had nothing of her own i swear my pots were just parts of a cheap set from target but they were all i had the last straw was when she ruined one heating it up with nothing in it why the world may never know i put all the pots and pans in my bedroom and kept my door locked after that i also banned her from touching anything i owned or had purchased i resorted to petty shit like these are my eggs and that is my remote i was young and entirely too salty for my own good i will openly admit she was so upset after a week of being denied part ownership of my things that she ended up insisting that i move out bold move honcho considering it was my name on the lease not hers and i had been letting her live with me without putting her name on the lease and we had another two months on our lease but ok fine sounds great to me bubbles so i went to the landlord and informed him i wanted out of my lease he was used to students bopping in and out college town and he said as long as i could find a sublessor and give up my deposit to that person i could leave early naturally he didnt know or probably care they were seedy college apartments that i had an illegitimate roommate who wasnt on my lease guess who got a new roommate curtesy of craigslist exactly two days later not me i couchsurfed with a friend across town until getting a better job and my own apartment this sounds harsh for a burnt pan but earlier in the year my dog bit her he nipped her hand there was no broken skin just one hell of a bruise he nipped her hand because he was in my room and she came in on her own accord when i was not home and reached over him and the threshold to my door to open my dresser i had a baby gate blocking him in my room so she had to admit thats what had happened but said she needed her necklace that was mysteriously in my room her parents bullied yearoldme into giving him away because i was young and scared of getting in trouble i was paying my own rent and needed her half i ended up agreeing to give the dog away to a friend the whole ordeal was terrible shortly after that she got a cat i think the whole thing was a setup so she could get a cat without my dog trying to eat it back to the chinese roommate guy found my ad said he and his wife would take it and they were at the door to the leasing office to sign papers that next day she was livid her parents were livid she had told them she was on the lease and they had been paying for half the rent so the sudden realization that she was lying and that she had nowhere to live was a bit exciting for everyone involved on that end but there was nothing they could do it was my apartment and i had the right to sublet it as she was not on the lease bitch dont use my pans i would like to note that i have mellowed quite a bit in the past several years i also lived alone after that until i met my husband five years later so maybe that helped i never apologized for forcing her to live with a random chinese man and his wife though and i have no idea how long she was still there with them until she moved he had the right to kick her out i assume he did so maggie im sorry i possibly forced brief homelessness upon you when we were sophomores in college also fuck your cat tldr bitch dont use my pans 
i worked in an office building for a large well known company when i was younger i was an intern living in the city making almost nothing solely for getting my foot in the door with this job everyone there was nice and i was learning a lot in the field i wanted to enter as far as i could tell things were going well that is until i had to deal with a certain incompetent manager well call him wank stain ws i had been working my job for about four months at this point and it was a real bust your ass kind of internship no get coffee and print this it was here are a stack of reports review them learn present to the team and eventually company board members every day i was hitting the work hard meeting difficult deadlines and doing everything i could to get the job done i got there before the sun rose and left well after it had gone down i was dedicated to this job and was determined to get everything i could out of it so being as this was an internship i was required to fill out a weekly timesheet this was signed by a manager in my department to pass onto finance for them to calculate my paycheck off of my hourly rate up to this point i had no issues with anyone signing it or turning it in this particular week most of the mangers in my department were traveling on business as was common in our industry not just an hour or two away but to the other side of the planet for weeks at a time kind of travel it was a friday and i needed my sheet signed now every manger is familiar with signing sheets and they dont think twice about it even for people who arent members of their particular team my manager and everyone else i would normally go to were away so enter ws now i was pretty familiar with ws but i had never worked one on one with him i had heard several stories

a couple years ago i was renting a duplex it was nice enough in a good area of town not the ideal living situation but the price was right my first set of neighbors were awesome a couple about my age who i shared interests with even though they watched tv or played video games at all hours i very rarely heard them unfortunately they moved out about four months after i moved in a couple with a toddler moved in the loudest toddler known to humankind this is relevant because my job did one of those merging and downsizing numbers and i was one of the employees who got cut no big deal i had a large emergency fund and could draw unemployment luckily i found a placeholder job shortly after working overnights the overnights were even something of an advantage because i could apply for and interview for jobs in my regular field during the day the problem was the hellspawn while i was trying to sleep the child would scream at the top of its lungs run stamping around their half of the duplex like a herd of elephants then scream some more when the kid watched tv shows the volume was always jacked to the absolute max it made sleeping difficult even with highquality earplugs or headphones i tried talking to them hey i work the night shift and so could you please try and keep it down a little nothing i tried worked no matter how polite or how firm i was the neighbors responded kids will be kids and thats apartment living you just hear your neighbors even though i mentioned my former neighbors had been avid movie watchers and i rarely heard them fine then i couldnt sleep they wouldnt before i left for my night shift i the volume on my sound system way up and had this on constant repeat five minutes after i got home the wife of the couple was hammering on my door she started yelling about how all the noise made it so they couldnt sleep i responded sorry i guess i must have set my alarm clock for the wrong time it must be rough when you cant sleep right simple as that the kid was much quieter i still heard them but only occasionally instead of almost constantly a couple months later i found a day shift job again and all was fine tldr neighbors kid was noisy neighbors wouldnt listen to polite complaints solved the problem with haddaway 
posting this to rpettyrevenge edit since removed and rprorevenge as the revenge was petty but the setup for it took a bit of effort its a long un as well working as a bouncer in a quiet gaming room tonight whilst struggling with my fifth day of being off cigarettes so im pretty edgy a young hipster chick comes up to the bar and asks me what goes with a liquorice liqueur im a single malt scotch man so im not too sure i reply with not sure when in doubt try soda water i suppose she then turns around and orders a pint of the cheapest beer for her equally cheap looking friend and a soda water at this point im thinking to myself nah she cant be that stupid well sure enough her friend with the beer goes to the table whilst soda hipster man i gotta trade mark that good indie band name goes directly to the toilets returning a minute later with that murky blue soda water black sambuca combo how stupid do you think i am girl really so i hover close enough to glean snippets of the conversation they were having plans of where to go from there involving going to get refills at the bottle shop and hitting a club both of which are nearby and happen to be guarded by good friends of mine in the security industry i duck into the adjacent smoking room and snap a pic of them plan forming i then clean up around their table when i accidentally air quotes bump her drink sending it flying over her white cloth bag and phone i immediately apologise and offer a replacement part one in action going to the bar i pour another soda water when i put it down in front of her she genuinely looks puzzled telling me she ordered a sambuca and soda to which i reply that she had in fact ordered a soda water self served her own alcohol into said drink illegal here to clarify and that once she finished her soda she could leave the venue as she wouldnt be served anymore she informed me that she didnt know it was illegal to do that to which i replied if you didnt think it was why do it in the toilets so no one could see you no response so i walk away telling the staff what happened part two involved me sending that pic to the venues the two hipsters who had been joined by equally hipster bfs were going to after here with a request to refuse service entry to soda hipstertm around minutes later she goes to the bar and asks for another soda water i calmly reiterate that she cant be served anymore to which she says with a smile thanks you ranga cunt non aussies ranga ginger and walks away obviously happy with this insult pfft i get called that and worse daily anyway i send a follow up text to the venue bouncers asking that when they knock her back tell her courtesy of the ranga cunt when her friends try to buy more drinks i have informed the staff to refuse them and to say courtesy of the ranga cunt as well just for a laugh after a few attempts soda hipstertm storms out with her obviously embarrassed friends as the bottle shop and club are literally on the same block as i with the bottle shop a few stores from the entrance to my venue i walk outside texting a third time that the group are leaving my place i can see the doorman big dev down the road at the bottle shop check his phone then stick his thumb up in the air without looking at the group the group arrive at the bottle shop and soda hipstertm is refused service i can tell when dev said the punch line as he bowed slightly before she spun and stared back in my direction to see me giving a casual wave at least her boyfriend found it funny by the look of him so they disappear around the corner to their second destination only to return around minutes later heading towards me whilst the venue manager and myself are pissing ourselves laughing at soda hipstertm storming ahead of the pack she pulls up at my door and angrily demands my name i inform her that by law i can only give her my security tag number so she wants to talk to the manager the vm steps in and says that i had done everything in accordance to the law and that if i said anything to other bouncers to help them in their duties that i was able to do so as its my choice not his frustrated she now wants the manager to get my boss down here i feign surprised horror at the suggestion then defeat telling the vm to grab the company business card from the security register as he is doing so soda hipstertm is standing there with a smug grin and crossed arms saying things like youre fucked now there goes your job etc while i try my best to look ashamed the boyfriend is clearly amused by the situation but also torn between being on his gfs side of the matter as well been there done that buddy the vm returns and gives soda hipstertm the company business card to which she pulls out her phone and starts dialing the

tldr dipshit breaks my friends windshield cant punch like a man i am russell crowe titties so i am a bouncer proof username pro revenge is probably my favorite subreddit so i contribute when i can so a few weeks ago there was a small get together at one of my friends apartments we were drinking goofing around having a good time well around am we hear a bunch of glass being broken we look out the third story window and see three guys sprinting away from the parking lot i think i recognize one of them but ive had a few so whatever we look over to my buddys truck and his windshield is smashed to hell its barely even in the truck anymore we call the police and they say theyll look into it but probably wont be able to do much since there were no cameras and we had been drinking goddamn small town cops my buddy is pissed and i tell him ill ask around and see what i can find out people talk at the bar fast forward to a night at work a few days later and im talking to one of my co workers about what happened he said im pretty sure i know who did it who it was one of my fraternity brothers hes a complete dickhead and im pretty sure he was bragging about it the other day at meeting would you be willing to tell the police nah probably not i hate the mother fucker but hes still in my fraternity he hazes way too hard though so you can fuck him up if you want to he could use a good ass whooping ive got a better idea he identified the guy as someone well call s for small penis well s is a frequenter at the bar considering its the only one in town that all the greeks go to so i started doing something every time s walked into the bar hes only so every time he would get someone to get him a drink i would rip it out of his hands and kick him out normally we just take the drinks from guys and give them a warning with three strikes well i would do this every single time he came to the bar it was a cover too he would pay come in get a drink and then i would kick him out under minutes every time well after about a dozen times he was really drunk one night and got pissed and got up all in my face i thought to myself he put on his big boy britches tonight he starts screaming fuck you asshole i dont have any fun at the bar anymore you never do this to anyone else stuff like that sir i do this everyone now leave the bar as i start to escort him off the dance floor out of nowhere he turns around and jaws me as hard as he can standard procedure is that when a fight breaks out we cut the music and turn on the lights so the other bouncers can have better visibility our dj was on point that night as soon as i got hit he cut the music immediately i just stopped and stood there looking at him the lights were on the music was stopped and a circle had begun to form around us i smiled and said you hit like a fucking bitch his face went from hardass to pussy in seconds i told him to hit me again he swung and i put my head down so he nailed me right in the forehead he yelled in pain and grabbed his hand point of information im a really big guy i was an offensive lineman for a division school in college and i was a national champion powerlifter in high school and college i know how to take a hit you punch like a fucking pussy i havent even hit you and im winning this fight try again you fucking bitch at this point he tried to tackle me to the ground i took one step back and just stood there as he put all his weight against me i threw him to the ground after a few seconds this was a lot easier than i thought it would be people were beginning to laugh at him for his bitchy attempts to hit me i couldnt resist i turned to the crowd and yelled are you not entertained i picked him up off the ground and said you are permanently banned from ltname of the bargt if you ever come back here ill hit you harder than you hit my friends windshield and with that i threw him out for the last time the only other bouncer on the floor was the guy who told me that s needed an ass whooping he was laughing his titties off the whole time from what my coworker told me s broke his hand on my skull and had to wear a cast for a few months so it cost him over to get thrown out of the bar before that night and i imagine several hundred more to get his hand fixed not only that but every single frat guy and sorority girl knows how big of a bitch he is so that cut his chances of getting laid down to nothing and his ability to shit talk at intramural games down to nothing as well my friend who got his windshield broken said insurance took care of everything and this was fantastic thats what you get for being a dickhead 
i worked for a software company as a qa test lead the company really liked me and i went from a general assistant to a test lead and tripled my pay in the space of the first and a half years i was there i have a strong work ethic and my opinion held a lot of weight years in when i was leaving to pursue other ventures my last manager there who we called half day hambly not his real last name but similar because he had a habit of disappearing after lunch on thursdays and fridays none of us minded too much since when he was there he liked to shoulder surf and micromanage projects where he knew absolutely nothing and generally made an ass of himself he was known for forcing projects off track and then blaming the platform programmers for the stall he had no problems tossing people under the bus to give the appearance that he was competent right before i left i had to have minor outpatient surgery and i stopped by his office to let him know that i would need to work from home for a few days afterward which was a routine occurrence in my department and i had done it on a couple of occasions he agreed and i went about my business until he informed me after i put in hours from home while recovering that i would need to use comp time to cover my missed hours i went to him and reminded him of the fact that he okd it and he gave me a fuck you smile and said well i guess you should have put it in an email so the following week when i did my exit interview with hr on my last day i unloaded on them and told them all about halfday hamblys adventures in mismanagement and how he regularly skipped out after lunch to go play golf on thursdays and fridays the hr manager i spoke with tried calling his office to bring him down right then but got no answer he asked me if id go by his office and bring him down but when i went up i found his office locked and no one answered the door the look on the hr managers face was priceless when i told him this as it was pm on friday when this happened the hr manager had my check adjusted for me wished me luck and i left with a smile on my face knowing i had outed this asshole weeks later my good friend and coworker called me up to say guess who they just fired hr started watching old halfday after i left and determined his caliber of excellence would serve him best somewhere else
i had posted the story of my divorce here a little while back is the story wellonto the fun part ampnbsp just days ago i was at my local walmart picking up dog food for my dogs and collard greens for my bearded dragon i had been having a strange feeling the entire time like an itch in the middle of my back that i couldnt quite reach to scratch it had started about minutes after i had gotten into the store and had been persistent the entire time only ever going away one time when i had stepped into the bathroom ampnbsp i came back out of the bathroom grabbed my cart and out of habit and reflex did a quick scan of the area by the bathrooms unfortunately i saw something i had no desire to see registers down trying to hide behind a rack of postcards and failing miserably due to the fully exposed very familar africanamerican child in the cartwas thundercunt ampnbsp from what i could see she was on the phone and not happy with the conversation she was having she would keep looking at me i had my phone out and was pretending to text while looking at her out of the corner of my eye and would get even more agitated ampnbsp so since i was pretty much done with shopping i wheeled my cart into the nearest cash register laid my items on the belt not the dog food i was gonna let them come with a hand scanner to scan that pound bastard of a bag and smoothly deliberately scanned over and stared directly at her ampnbsp well this apparently set her off because as soon as she saw me doing so she blew up on the phone seemed to be practically yelling into it i calmly finished paying for my items put the bags into my cart and headed for the entrance thundercunt however had other plans ampnbsp she promptly pushed her cart out of her ineffective hiding spot took a second to see which way i had gone and took off after me she almost threw her cart in front of me trying to get me to stop and proceeded to give me the dirtiest look i had ever seen from her and thats saying something and then said something i still have yet to wrap my mind around ampnbsp i want my divorce ampnbsp now i had to stop and take a second to try to process that particular statement as to my knowledge we had gone through our divorce hearing several months prior so after thinking it over and discarding the statement as being the raving of a person who already lost the argument but refuses to let it go i maneuvered my cart around hers took a second to smile at her child hell i had nothing against the baby and all jokes aside she was adorable and began walking out the door thundercunt responded with oh youre just going to ignore me i want my divorce you bitch ampnbsp well i just kept walking on my way out a rather burly guy of the tshirt with the sleeves cut off variety rushed past me right up to tc they exchanged a brief flurry of conversation littered with her pointing at me and then at him ending with her throwing her hands up and walking away with her cart he looked at me i smiled a bit and gave them both the onefinger salute and loaded my stuff in my truck and left ampnbsp honestly the only thing i can assume from the situation is that he was either a a new boyfriend or b a family member that i wasnt familiar with hell might have been both who knows that she had enlisted the help of to either intimidate me into giving her more or to rough me up it would make sense with her spouting off a statement that had been invalidated months beforehand either way whatever she was attempting failed miserably when i applied the tried and true method of ignore the idiots and move on tldr thundercunt comes back for round gets shut down just as hard as before 
i used to work at a busy local pizza restaurant as a pizza cutter for ph cash in hand so my job involved cutting pizzas and sorting out the orders not very hard unless there is twenty coming out of the oven in a minute anyhow i wont lie i would make a couple of mistakes here and then with orders as you would expect you would a stern talking to by the boss after each one however after a while the mistakes started becoming more and more frequent to the stage where i was getting screamed at i was now triple checking orders because i was sure i had them right one night i was up to eight mistaken orders then i turn around and catch the mother fucker mixing up my orders that i had organised and then walking off i was fucking furious i was copping all this shit because this cunt bag was making mistakes so after that night i fucking handed it to him i told him what i thought about him and his shitty restaurant there were no safety or health standards enforced with the meals or anywhere in the kitchen tbh so here is what i do turns out a lot of my friends ordered from the store so of course i tell them how there food is prepared and how there is no respect for the employees by word of mouth one of the people still working there tells me their nights gradually began getting quieter then i thought to myself how else can i fuckover this cunt bag then i remembered that he used to make around after wages every night so i did some math and established if he had been cutting corners by keeping people off the books then he owed a shit load of tax and super to everyone that worked there so i made a phone call to the tax office and it turns out he owed them upwards of au provided he had been paying cash in hand for the past eight years the business had been running ill just say there is no more local pizza shop i believe the tax evasion also landed him some jail time so serves the cunt right tldr boss was an asshole i made him lose his business and had him sent to jail

i posted this to rpettyrevenge but have received encouragement to post it here as well this is going to be long but ive been dying to tell this story its about how i put a narcissistic woman in her place after being accused of stealing on facebook a few years ago i was involved in one of those swap and sell groups on facebook it was specifically for stayathome moms and mostly centered around trading and selling clothing toys etc it was an awesome resource because you could get things for your children at a very low price and often make new friends in the process there was one woman however that made the swap and sell group an unpleasant place well call her kathy in person all she ever talked about was herself specifically about how great she was she did the same for her kids she would also slip little hints in about how you or your children were inferior in some way for example she would say things like oh your childs soccer team came in third place last season my sons team came first but thats not very surprising considering how good he is i must have done a great job raising him and its a shame that others cant do the same with their children she really would say things like that in hindsight she was a narcissist im not just saying that im pretty sure she could be diagnosed i just did the best i could to avoid her if i saw her in the next aisle of a store one day she saw me with my infant son he was crying so she came over and said oh let me hold him i can get him to calm down it was infuriating almost everyone hated her but kathy really took it to the next level when it came to the swap and sell she would be the first in line to buy something only to demand a lower price upon inspection these clothes look dirtier than what i saw in the picture i will only pay half she did this crap all the time and if the seller didnt oblige she posted a rant about how they screwed her over never do business with them yada yada this sort of talk was technically against the rules of the swap and sell but kathy was friends with the administrator so nothing was ever done the administrator was lazy anyway and rarely interacted with the group furthermore kathy had a few cronies that would send pms to everyone in the group badmouthing sellers who didnt accpet kathys half price crap it was borderline blackmail i always felt some anxiety when i posted something for sale because i was afraid kathy would claim it first and then pull her scam which she did several times she had facebook hooked up to her phone and since she sat at home and did nothing all day she was fast to jump on items for sale oftentimes she would buy something and then it would appear for sale months later at a jacked up price what made this all the more frustrating was the fact that she was a pastors wife and had good standing in the community nobody knew what a bitch she was even though she was a toxic and selfish person who cared only about herself i put up with this woman for three years then one day i had had enough i listed a toy for sale it needed aa batteries to work knowing this i purchased a new pack of batteries and put them in the toy i tested it it worked i said that batteries were included in my listing everything seemed to be in order within two minutes kathy jumped in and said she wanted it she obviously saw it pop up on her phone while she was lounging around at home the rules said i had to offer it because it was first come first serve and i could not skip over buyers so with a heavy heart i set up a time to bring it to kathys house she refused to meet me halfway or come to my home as was her custom i dropped off the toy when i was in town running errands the next day kathy didnt try to pull the usual it looks dirtier than the pic scam so that was nice she asked if the batteries were included and i said yes i received payment and went about my day kathy was playing fair bout damn time but when i got home i had notifications on facebook kathy had tagged me in a post uh oh this couldnt be good in her post she claimed that there were no batteries she posted a pic of the empty battery slots shamed me for my shady sales tactics gave a little sob story about how her chubby year old soccer star was upset that he couldnt play with it and demanded her money back on top of this shitstorm one of my friends pmed me saying that people were receiving messages from kathys cronies about how selfish and shady i was that bitch i had never been more pissed and hurt in my life i was done putting up with this chicks shit i responded with a rather lengthy message calling her out on her scams in the past i said she was a liar for removing the batteries and that she should be ashamed of herself for behaving in such a manner when she was a pastors wife many people liked my comment and i knew that the shit was about to hit the fan but i didnt care anymore when i logged in to facebook the next day i had a ton of notifications and messages my stomach dropped i skimmed through the messages first some were positive thanking me for calling kathy out some were negative from kathys cronies about what a rude person i was to say those things about her as for the notifications most of them stemmed from a single post that had been stickied by the administrator in the swap and sell group apparently she overcame her laziness just long enough to publicly humiliate me the post said that thieves yes thieves were not tolerated in the group and then went on to mention me by name this was no small thing as there were many women involved in this group and we were in a small midwestern town where word traveled fast my reputation as a mother was being attacked the post went on to say that rather than banning me i had the opportunity to apologize and refund the money i owed the first comment to the post was from kathy she said something that no doubt she had been dying to say for a long time it went something like this sk youve stolen money from me and tried to blame your past actions on me as well and yet in the face of your accusations i have been patient and kind this peace comes from the lord if you would only accept him as your savior you would feel the same peace if nothing else this whole situation just proves that i am better than you over twenty people liked the comment holy fuck this shit had to stop kathy the narcissist was turning the tables and accusing me of actions which were actually hers an actual case of projection the time for vengeance had come the revenge this requires a bit of explaining you see kathy had a secret one that i stumbled on by accident several years prior while reading the local newspaper while doing errands in the next town over in one small corner regarding court happenings there was a column about a man who had killed his friend while high on bath salts i dont remember the exact details of the crime nor did i know what the nature of the court proceedings were but thanks to the column i did know that this man had been found mentally unfit to stand trial and sent to the state mental hospital and i did know the names of his parents who were present at the hearing the parents strangely enough had the exact same names as kathy and her husband i did some googling and discovered that this man was kathys oldest son kathy never mentioned having another son for obvious reasons this crime happened when kathy and her family were living in this other town soon after her son was sent to the mental ward kathy and her husband moved away to my town i knew that she had lived elsewhere before joining the swap and sell but i didnt know that she had moved to distance herself and her husband from their dark secret this was my short and sweet response to kathys comment i still remember it word for word kathy youve asked me to apologize for actions that were yours and then have the audacity to say that youre better than me but whats funny kathy is that the son you raised turned out to be a lunatic murderer i will always be better than you and i posted a link to the old news article i did not stick around to watch everything go down as i was sick of the drama i removed myself from the group and went about my day the aftermath i received a phone call from a close friend in the evening and i learned what had happened after i posted the link to the article about kathys son the comments section absolutely blew up kathy and her cronies posted several comments where the group administrator was tagged demanding that my comment be deleted my friend said that there were several posts like this and they started to sound pretty desperate near the end the lazy administrator of course was slow to respond kathy even said something about driving to the administrators house since she was not returning her phone calls after a couple of hours the whole swap and sell group was deleted but the damage was done as for what happened to kathy i never had the chance to find out as she deleted her facebook i saw her in the grocery store a few weeks later but she just flipped me off and walked the other way my friends and i founded a new swap and sell group it gets bigger every day but kathy is not a part of it
first post long time lurker here but i believe you guys would like this story this is not my story but of a good friend of mine lets call him mitch whom ive known for many many years now this happened years ago when mitch and i were both yo mitch has two younger brothers at the time and yo mitch and his brothers had the most beautiful golden lab always friendly a bit lazy as labs can be loved everybody truly a great dog the neighbor though hated the dog something about its fur getting in his lawn when it shed i live in a warm mediterranean country so dogs tend to shed a lot here something about it barking during siesta in any case the neighbor was being a bitch about it now mitchs parents are of the quiet type trying to accommodate they even put a fence inside their own yard to keep the dog in the other side of the yard facing the property of the other neighbor that had no issues with their dog kept the dog inside during siestas and mitch and his brothers would brush the undercoat regularly during the summer months to limit any shedding to make a long story short one day they come back home after a day trip and they find the dog convulsing and foaming in their yard dying soon after they immediately knew what happened as the telltale signs of a poisoned dog were all too familiar to the father as he had witnessed it time and time again in his youth when the local police would poison stray dogs during the s and s to contain an outbreak of rabies mitch and his brothers were inconsolable their parents confronted the neighbor who without admitting guilt said something along the lines the dog had it coming the parents for reasons unknown probably to avoid any prolonged legal battle or to just put an end to the story decided not to press charges which forced mitch and his brothers to take the appropriate action they believed the neighbor deserved i am not saying that i condone what they did but lets say that as a dog lover it still brings a smile to my face years later they waited patiently for days after the event when the neighbor and his wife their children had moved out a few years prior went out for the night small parenthesis all were and still are some of the kindest and most thoughtful boysmen that i know but i regress they waited for the neighbors to go out for the night and thats when they broke into the house and started to systematically destroy everything the neighbors owned electronics furniture drapes carpets bedlinen everything they spent a good one hour in the neighbors house wreaking havoc he later told me that it was very meticulous and systematic they all were crying and just moving on to the next object to break or shear or tear they then sat outside the porch and waited sometime later the neighbor comes back home and they just stare at him and smile waiving to him as he enters his house with his wife he never pressed charges either mitchs parents now have golden labs in the yard and have always had dogs since then as far as i know they never really had issues with the neighbor either
when i was younger my favorite fruit was strawberries i could eat pounds and pounds of it and not get sick unfortunately it is also my mothers favorite fruit every time we would buy some she would tell me to only eat half since the other half was hers of course being six years old and home alone does not give me good impulse control so i ate all of the box my mother whooped my butt and sent me to bed without dinner i thought that was the end of it my mother on the other hand decided that she was sick of me eating all the strawberries in the house she decided that she was going to stop me from eating them once and for all so she decided to change the detergent and do all of my laundry now i have very sensitive skin and i am allergic to a lot of things including fragrances i break out into hives when i deal with an allergen so she changed the detergent to a very abrasive one to get back at me the next day i broke out in hives at school and fainted mom wasnt done then she took me to the doctor for a blood test since we were still trying to figure out if i was diabetic and told me that the doctors think i am allergic to strawberries this was devastating i was told that it could have been worse that i could have died from eating even a little bit it has been years since i have had a single bite of a strawberry i barely remember what they taste like however i found out all about this at a family party when introducing my boyfriend i told him about how i cant have strawberries for dessert my mom walks up looks at me funny of course you can youre not allergic the second i reminded her she began to laugh oh you were never allergic i found out the rest from my dad thanks mom i hate you too tldr dont fuck with my mom edit i did not expect this to blow up as bad as it did glad you guys thought it was an entertaining story for those who were wanting it to be about me getting revenge see rule now to answer the most frequent issues since you guys are starting to scare me my mom is not an abuser she is a little mentally unhinged but she does her best with what she has she thought this was the best way to teach me a lesson and it did it was not the best way to go about it however i fainted not because of the hives but because i had forgotten to eat my snack according to my dad i was diagnosed with type two diabetes when i hit that age second we were a poor family who couldnt afford child care my cousins lived the apartments above us and my mother worked at the grocery store that was a five minute walk even when i was six she was our only provider due to my dads dickishness when we finally moved for her new job we got child care but i was too old for that by then the big deal was that i was taking away all the treats in our house for myself thats why my mother was upset we rarely got anything sweet let alone fresh fruit hence why i went crazy yes my dad knew i have no idea why he didnt tell me its over and done now for me i thought it was a little funny but it confirmed my ideas about putting them both in a nursing home
i needed a place to stay and did not have much of a choice in the matter the price and location were right so i had to rent from this slumlord the landlord he is a self proclaimed handy man he drove a gutted out shitball of a van filled with cheeseburger wrappers and junk acted less than interested in any of my problems as a tenant i went through fridges used ones not new of course hundreds in groceries lost a bunch of clothing and furniture when the house flooded twice in one week there was a faint but constant smell of natural gas the furnace only worked when you lit the pilot light which you had to do every time you wanted heat in the winter and half a fucking tree that landed on the roof during a storm but was never removed me minnesotan tend to be too god damn nice at times always always always pay my rent on time took care of all of the utilities and general upkeep mowed shoveled snow cleaned the lawn etc etc of the property during my tenancy good tenant i have too many stories about this cat but ill get to the revenge part of this i had finally had enough and i had decided to move out of this slum i had lost thousands in my own money to use on the upkeep of the property since the landlord had no intention on helping me ever i had found a new place and had told my landlord the news when i handed him a check for a month and a half and told him that i would be moving out in a set number of days we agreed and it seemed to go quite well this is when all of the shit really started running downhill he showed up in my apartment one day unannounced and was looking for something to this day i dont know what but i confronted him and he ran out of my apartment like he had been just caught snooping in a womans panty drawer then when i am at work he starts leaving me this really creepy messages saying i didnt pay him rent and that i have been destroying the property i brush it off take a few days off of work and move out of my place after i call my new landlord explaining my dilemma my new landlord agrees to let me move in early free of charge awesome i move out and get a couple of friends to help me deep clean the place its amazing what you can buy with a case of beer and some pizza we clean the place and its spotless after we finish i get this weird feeling and i take pictures tons and tons of pictures of every room feeling content we pack up the rest lock the doors and leave we had a good night and i bought pizza and beer for my friends that came out to help a couple days go by and slumlord larry calls and asks where i went i explained that i really wanted to move and i worked out a situation with my new landlord that would allow me to move in early he started shouting at me on the phone going off about how i still owe him money and i couldnt terminate my lease which there was no such thing by the way just a verbal agreement and the exchange of money i had enough of his business and i hung up a month goes by i hear nothing from the slumlord then all of a sudden i get a certified letter from him in the mail along with some pictures how in the fuck did he get my new address i think to myself i open the letter and dude is going to try and fucking sue me stating that i damaged his property with supposed pictorial evidence and for the neat sum of dollars it would all go away and we would not need to take it to court i say fuck this and i call up my parents to get the number for their lawyer i explain everything to him and tell him about the pictures i saved i ask my lawyer if there is anything that i could do about this im steaming and i want blood my lawyer laughed it off and told me to go check and see if the property was listed under a rental property in the city that i lived in the next day i go down to the government center and i find out that the slumlord does not have it listed as anything other than residential i turn him in and i also find out that the property cannot be rented and a permit for someone to even come look at the property to make sure it was up to code in the county i lived in was jubilant would not even begin to describe my mood at this time i was white guy celebrating the bitch out of the lobby i call my lawyer as i am leaving the government center and tell him the good news as i am leaving town i decide to drive past my place and see if anyone is living there as i pass i cant believe my fucking eyeballs i see the slumlord and a buddy of his toothless dave outside the house destroying the siding i also see that they had fucked up every exterior part of the house to try and pin their misdeeds on me months go by i hear nothing my lawyer hears nothing despite multiple tries to contact slumlord at this point i am filled with an overwhelming sense of joy as i stuck it to that loser but wait theres more i was telling this story to a buddy of mine at work one day and he knew exactly what house i was talking about his dad is the county building inspector and he was telling me about how is dad had stated that the property was so damaged that the house was to be condemned all im left thinking about is what did he do to that fucking place to condemn it after i moved out tldr slumlord didnt do shit for me and i lost out on a ton of money got him back by finding out the property was not listed as a rental property house ended up getting condemned
i never believed in karma until this story a couple of years back i was in a relationship with a wonderful girl we had been together for years at that point living together for of them about a year and a half after we moved in together i lost my job it hit me hard to say the least and i became kinda depressed i guess my girlfriend though comforting me and helping me out was too much because she began sleeping with her coworker i saw their email exchange and i lost it i wanted to confront her so bad but i knew that would do nothing so i decided to get some revenge because i wasnt on the lease when we got the apartment i had shitty credit i could move out no problem one morning i arranged some movers to come by our apartment and moved out but before i did that i logged into her email and forwarded the exchange between her and the coworker to the head of hr later that day i got a text saying that her company let her go that they were cutting back on staff i simply texted her i know youve been cheating on me with earl not his real name i moved out this morning never talk to me again days later she shows up at my moms house asking where i am my mom plays dumb and says she has no clue she relentlessly texted me after i moved out and continued to do so for a while last i heard she moved in with her sister suffers from depression and is an alcoholic i guess im a bad person because that brought a smile on my face edit forgot to add that the guy she was cheating on me with got fired as well
background im a real estate developer and investor and i ownmanage several midsize multifamily rental properties im aggressive with rents but i love the construction side of the business and take great pride in keeping my properties in excellent condition i also ensure my staff provides top notch customer service i never understood why property managers dont have the same attitude towards customer service as hoteliers anyways one of my friends lives in a building owned by a very traditional landlord a grumpy old lady bangs on the door to collect rent every month things dont get fixed unless you threaten to file a dispute and in general everything is fixed as cheaply as possible my friend called me last week and said her fire alarm has been going off since am not the fire alarm actually but the warning tone on the annunciator panel this is the device that receives inputs from heat detectors smoke detectors etc all around the building and monitors and provides power and battery backup this panel was apparently detecting a fault and sounding the warning tone this isnt the fire alarm but it sounds like a loud smoke detector going off it cannot be silenced until it is serviced in my buildings they occasionally do go off every few years and as with everything else my staff must attend within hour and in this case appropriate action would be to call the fire safety contractor for an emergency service call my friends landlord informed her that the contractor had been called but it was not an emergency so they would be there in days days of this alarm going off constantly no sleep for anyone this was likely to avoid the overtime surcharge for an emergency service or about but the manager was kind enough to wrap the panel in several towels with packing tape to slightly muffle the alarm he made a halfhearted attempt to silence it by pulling the leads off the backup battery since the device is hardwired this just doubled the frequency of the alarm to include a backup battery warning i grabbed by panel keys and went over to see if i could help my friend out i was able to open the panel since i have keys for my own and they are the same the battery leads had been pulled off but the main was still connected so the beeper was going off like crazy the manager didnt know enough to turn off the breaker in the electrical room and i couldnt access it the manager didnt answer the phone upon opening the panel i saw immediately why it had been failing on and off for years according to my friend the batteries were years out of date and the leads on the terminals were blackened it looked like the landlord had been swapping out the old batteries with new ones for the yearly inspection then putting the old ones back in and maybe returning the new batteries for a refund now i realized why the service call was scheduled so late so the ll could get some temporary new batteries put in time now im a licensed property manager but not an electrician so it would be unethical for me to remove the hot lead from the bus bar and silence the alarm but low voltage wiring is a different story unfortunately my insulated screwdriver slipped as i was tightening the battery lead back on and i accidentally bridged the hot side of the bus bar with the low voltage side of the circuit board luckily my eyes were averted to avoid arcing injury v right to the control board ouch a big flash breaker tripped somewhere and silence the circuit board was toast the service tech would have to install a new panel with new batteries my friend contacted the landlord and reported that something had happened and the panel was silenced also did he intend to provide a hour firewatch until such time as the fire alarm system is fully functional as required by section of the fire code he affirmed that he did not and that she could fuck off her next call was to the assistant chief fire inspector since she happened to have his business card handy his response was much more gracious he was happy to provide the necessary firewatch and contacted the landlord to inform him of the fact the firemans union is a strong one and their hourly rate for emergency services like this are comparable to a midtown manhattan law firm im told the bill reached before the landlord called the service tech to replace the annunciator panel id like to say he also paid the fine but i understand he is fighting that in court in the meantime the building sleeps peacefully with a fully functional and up to date fire alarm 
just thought i would share a story related to me by my grandfather back in the war my grandpa was in the navy he was a fairly skinny guy but obscenely tough being of italian heritage he received more than his fair share of shit from his shipmates being as italy was not exactly on the best of terms with the us back in wwii i can only imagine the cornfed muricans on his ship were pretty much dick to him he could have easily brawled and come out on top but that wasnt his style he was a gentleman and apparently always gave people the benefit of the doubt and allowed opportunities to change their own minds one job of his on ship was packing and repacking i assume parachutes quick sidebar here when you were going to be jumping out of a plane be it for a combat mission or training you used the chute you are issued no exceptions none you are given a parachute and thats what you used anywho my grandpa would occasionally play with the chutes of people who made his life hell not that they were in any way unsafe just playing with peoples heads what he would do is leave a few scraps of tattered parachute cloth or suspension cord hanging out of the packed chute when he was issuing the chutes to the dickheads and someone noticed stuff sticking out he would just go ok no problem and cut off the offending material and hand it back to the guy he cut off the junk he had added the chutes were still perfectly packed these assholes would have to spend the next few hours knowing that heir chutes had been tampered with and that they were jumping to their deaths obviously they werent but the didnt know it until they pulled the cord and their chute worked perfectly people stopped being dicks to him and just left him alone after he taught a few people their lesson my grandpa is a smart old guy
been enjoying this subreddit and thought id post my own story here while not as epic as some of these or as clever as nobody ended up in jail or out thousands of dollars for me it was a pretty important victory regarding the survival mode thing years ago i was living with a couple of friends and lost both my job and my place to live within the same hours when the economy shit itself and the bank foreclosed on the owner where we were staying had about two weeks to get out and i ended up homeless and living in my car for two years thats another story entirely the point however is when living in a large city in a vehicle your survival mode kicks in constantly youre always worried youre always cautious and in the event something happens thats a threat you usually think of the most effective brutal and quickest way to remove it as a threat as a result even years later now that im stable i dont really have the ability to gauge an appropriate response to a threat maybe thats why i went overboard here but ill share the story and let others be amused or pass judgement as the case may be when i was living in my car i developed a relationship with someone who was a bit more stable than i was she didnt really care that i lived in a car as i was always presentable and was able to hold down temp work nobody really knew i lived in a car unless i shared that info with them she was big on helping people and was genuinely a good person as i thought at the time we had a falling out and just gradually lost contact our relationship was more of a passion thing we remained friends on facebook and she was fairly popular on there with about five hundred friends this is important later about a year after the two of us broke up and about six months after i had last spoken to her outside of a few casual comments and likes i was doing much better i had just started a new job that i was about to go through training for and afterwards would be out of the car and into a more permanent residence i had done a lot to work towards that point and things were great i was at a kinkos using their internet on my laptop and my phone rang it was her after a very brief exchange of pleasantries she gets to the point her current boyfriend got her pregnant and left her she needed someone to take her to the abortion clinic and since she was posterchild perfect girl to her circle of friends and family she couldnt ask any of them to do it so she was asking me on one hand i was perturbed that this was the first time we had spoken in a long time and this was the only subject she felt was important enough to call me on on the other i try to be a good guy and even though it backfires i was raised that way but in this situation i really couldnt help her because i was supposed to drop my car off at a friends house the next day then hop a bus to another state for my orientation and new job even if i wanted to which i really didnt i couldnt i told her as much and then shit hit the fan she started screaming at me on the phone acting hysterical crying telling me that i was a horrible person i had to help her i didnt care about her etc by this point the other people in the computer area are hearing her scream at me over my phone and im getting quite a few stares i tell her in a tense voice that i had to get off the phone and for her to send me a message some of you may be getting ahead of me here and see where this is going and think in advance im an asshole but please reserve judgement i promise its worth it my facebook chat window starts lighting up with more insults i realize that this may bite me in the ass remember about how i dont respond well to things i see threatening and start to steer the conversation asking her details and she gets dragged along i confirm in the chat that she was pregnant i confirm in the chat he ran out on her i asked why he ran out on her as i thought the two of them were close and she tells me that there was a chance it wasnt his i tell her that once again i cant help her as i need to catch a bus tomorrow morning up to this point im willing to wish her luck and let it go i start a new life tomorrow she then drops a bombshell on me if you dont help me with this im going to tell everyone that its yours and that you raped me oh hell no she did not just say that and then i realize she said it over facebook chat instead of warning her instead of telling her to fuck off i instead start thinking about what a false rape accusation would do to me on the eve of everything thats about to change for my life i have one thought borne out of the survival mode that got kicked into high gear destroy this bitch and i know how to do it i ask her if shes serious when she knows theres no way the kid is mine she says she doesnt care i ask her who she thinks is going to believe her she says its my word against hers and who are people going to believe her or some homeless fuckoff who lives in his car knowing i know have enough ammo i pretend to reluctantly relent i tell her goddamnit fine ill help you but i cant take you to the clinic tomorrow it will have to be later this week i have to change my plans let me call you tomorrow she agrees i then get to work within a few minutes the chat transcript has been sent to about a hundred people on her friendslist and i tagged all of our mutual friends the chat was also linked on her church page and her employers page i also sent it to her parents for good measure as an afterthought almost instantly my phone starts to blow up i shut off my laptop shut off my phone and went out to my car to spend my last night in it theres not much i can say about the fallout that will do it justice more than whats probably playing in your heads sides were chosen legal threats were made firings happened death threats were thrown around needless to say her reputation was completely ruined to the point that she not only had to delete all forms of social media but she had to move clear across the country to get rid of the stigma from the small town she grew up in over the top maybe but it was so so sweet it warms my heart on cold winter nights
in college my brother and i were taking a class together which was basically a public speaking awareness elective we had to attend university forums one night at the first one of these terribly dry presentations my brother and i were seated in the back of the auditorium near the entrance right next to a handlettered moveable sign that read please no food or drink in the auditorium out of boredom we started picking the letters off of the board and rearranging them the final result left the board reading old penis in the rum drink this seemed like the best possible combination we had a chuckle and forgot all about it after leaving i realized i had left my keys under my seat so i went back inside only to find several faculty appalled at the public obscenities someone left on their precious sign the most outwardly upset of the bunch coincidentally also happened to be my year old statistics professor he was a heinous old fuck it pleased me to see him helplessly perturbed so we made it a point to change the sign every week while attending the forums week after week it became more challenging to ninja our way to seconds alone with the sign as they had started covertly guarding it during the presentations but week after week upon leaving the gathering everyone was again saluted with old penis in the rum drink as they went home it was a slow continuous burn on the final forum of the semester two of the old bastards shouldered the sign the entire night so anticipating this we simply hand wrote several poster boards with our mantra old penis in the rum drink and taped them all over the lobby walls this caused the old professor and his humorless gang to almost shit themselves they ran around pulling down the posters as the student body exit the theater laughing at them hysterically you see we had become a hero of the people to put one final nail in this angry mathmans heart the morning before our statistics final my brother and i found our way into the classroom early pulled down the projector screen knowing it would not be used in class and left one final message written on the whiteboard behind it as class was starting in walks angry old dr statistics he promptly raises the outofplace projector screen and bam old penis in the rum drink
i originally posted this story in rpettyrevenge but a few people pointed out that it might belong here as well so here it goes a few years ago i was at my city airport about to board on a very short minute long airplane trip to another city i did the whole procedure registered my tickets sent my luggage to be wrapped and stood still in the corner now this is important i was dressed with a white tshirt and a black pair of pants looking really formal so i looked like someone from the airport staff specially because i was standing close to the airport map staring at nothing waiting for my flight i heard a commotion in the hall next to the checkin area looked there and then i saw him the asshole dude was giving everyone in the airport staff and passengers a very hard time demanding priority in the check in service and making a huge scene apparently he was too wealthy to just wait in line like everyone else he screamed so much one of the staff girls actually cried i heard he was trying to get a flight from curitiba to campinas two cities in brazil which was exactly the flight i was in so i saw an onceinalifetime opportunity to avenge the poor girl and the rest of the staff i went to the departure section and just stood still next to the place where you go to board the planes with those tubes that connect the bulding to the planes this is what i mean i dont know if usa airports have this kind of stuff anyway i stood in the long corridor and when he came close to me i asked him are you sir flying to campinas or to rio de janeiro campinas he said in that disgusting voice that way i pointed to one of the tunnels entrance to my left if he made past this point in the building it meant that somebody already checked his id and ticket so nobody would question him when he got into the plane i pointed which means that he was not going to campinas actually god knows where he might have ended up if he didnt realize he was in the wrong plane tldr dude was being rude and violent in the airport redirected him to the wrong plane to teach him a lesson
i have a colleague who loves listening to his music on his computer unfortunately his choice of music is some or other wailing gospel stuff that sets my teeth on edge were in an openplan office so music and additional noise are not welcome when he first got a desk next to mine he played his music for a bit i asked him to turn it down and he did for a while the next time it was back at the usual volume so i gave him a spare pair of earphones figuring that might be nice and subtle he wore them once and then the music was back fortunately im a network admin at work so i have administrator access to his pc i used a remote processkilling application to kill windows media player the moment he walked away from his pc after this happened a number of times he switched to using itunes so i killed that too then vlc and then winamp it drove him insane hed leave his desk and the music would stop i even killed it remotely from home once or twice just so he wouldnt suspect me eventually it all became a little tiresome and i haved his pcs registry killing the sound card drivers and all sound on his pc ceased he never figured that out he did reinstall windows recently a year later and the sound works but he has not played music since my processkilling scripts are ready
so this story is going to sound fucked up from the title but just to be clear the divorce was for legitimate reasons out of my control i just happened to help the realization leading to it at the private school i grew up in i became friends with dylan now dylan and i became great friends because we both were class clowns and had a lot of fun with it little did i realize dylan actually hated me and talked shit behind my back because he wanted to be the funniest kid in class and didnt like sharing that title little did i know the amount of shit he would talk about me behind my back the crap he would say about my family my personality etc etc i was however frustrated with when he started putting on this tough guy attitude since i dont like fighting and prefer to settle disputes with words hed always try and pick a fight with me knowing id never fight back my parents are disciplinary as fuck and would beat the hell out of me for anything like that so hell no am i fighting he would apparently fuck with me whenever i invited him on birthday sleepovers such as literally kicking my ass fucking with my toys etc i assumed it was other friends but turns out it was him but this is what truly set me off i started getting a passion for art almost any kind because i was forced into math and science but art made me feel like i could be creative and have more control im still in math and science today but i love to sing cook draw and write so one day i spent three hours in school drawing the greatest panda ever the shading the colors and just overall this drawing was perfection i fucking love pandas and this was my greatest accomplishment so dylan takes my drawing and goes like oh this looks cool ill take it i save face and fake it like i dont care and say oh whatever i can make a new one anyways but it was clear from my eyes that i was pissed so this bitch decides to fuck with me and say then i guess you dont care if i do this and tears up the fucking drawing right in front of me i spent so much time on that and it made me love drawing and he killed it petey the panda i will fucking avenge you once i was fuming a few weeks later some friends told me everything hed do they felt guilty for hiding it and didnt want to anymore i forgave them and told them it was all ok but now i was epically mad i was ready to strike and upon peteys grave i will lay a vial of dylans tears a month or so later he invited me to his house for his birthday sleepover to fuck with me but i planned for a year old i was pissed off little did he realize that my dad knew about how dylans mom and dad were starting to fight having overheard this between my parents i knew what my revenge would be at am i decided to sneak into his parents room and brought some lipstick i borrowed from my cousin i went to some of his dads shirts in the back and put the lipstick on my lips and kissed the shirt collar all over the collar i did this to a few shirts in the back part of the closet and then i quietly snuck back to the bathroom washed my lips off and then snuck back into bed the next morning nothing had happened but apparently dylan wanted to prank me later after lunch fortunately my parents planned on picking me up after breakfast and i silently left a month or so later i hear my dad telling my mom how dylans parents are getting divorced because dylans dad cheated i was shocked that my plan actually worked turns out it worked but his dad was actually cheating when his mom saw the lipstick marks on the collar she started looking through his email accounts and found a lot of interesting conversations in some of his secondary emails and lastly she caught him in the act after all of this snooping and that naturally was the final straw dylan became a really quiet kid after that and would rarely talk to anyone he turned into a loner and teachers were having problems with him because of this too apparently he became known as the boy with no emotion because hed rarely ever speak or laugh or cry or anything i gotta say i kinda hoped that his parents would just wind up having a fight or something small but when i wound up giving the step that led to everything unveiling well that surprised the hell out of me but i still avenged petey though
so a couple of years ago i worked as a cdl driver for a small construction company in a dumpy little oil town in utah right when i had my interview with them i knew they were real jerks by their attitudes but hey i needed money and was still going through flight school the owner and his cronies would drive up in their huge trucks every morning and belittle anyone who didnt have a huge truck or be in their circle of douchiness with them i drove a subaru since nobody had a cdl except one other guy i had to drive their crappy dump truck and pull a work trailer this truck wasnt licensed with dot and neither was the trailer they wouldnt pass inspection so the cronies would drive out to the job site ahead of me and scout out any dot vehicles waiting to pull people over if the coast was clear i would drive out to the job site it gets worse they also had a hydrovac truck this was a piece of equipment that would blast a jet of high pressure water into the ground to break it up and then suck up all the mud it was primarily used to expose leaky oil pipe lines to be later fixed and then suck up all the remaining contaminated mud after it was sprayed its a glorified wet vac you could tell where a pipe was leaking because the ground turned grey and black i had to drive this piece of equipment too after the contaminated mud was sucked up i asked where the disposal unit was so i could dump it i worked up in north dakota before this and took extensive classes about not to break the law with illegal dumping the douche management squadron who were all brothers looked at me funny and said to just go dump it in a ditch i was completely surprised and warned them of the consequences of doing that they didnt care and said to just go dump it in the company lot then basically a dirt field by the shop the general manager then followed me out to the lot and watched me dump it i knew it was wrong and took pictures of the dump spot with my phone to make a long story short this oil dumping happened three more times all of which someone was with me in the truck to make sure i did it even after i warned them all times i was able to stealthily take pictures with my phone i started to be treated very poorly after about a month and a half of working there all because i warned them about the dumping and i didnt fit into their crowd the manager would tell me to do a job a certain way and then another assistant manager would tell me to do it differently when the manager got pissed i did it the other way the assistant manager would throw me under the bus and say i wasnt compliant one day i was pulling a flatbed trailer to a job to pick up a huge trencher the white trash crony loaded it completely wrong and noncompliant with dot regs i changed the way it was loaded to be legal and the crony got mad and said its fine ive been around trucks for years even though he wasnt the one with a cdl i told him i wanted to be legal in case i was pulled over and he went and told the higher up manager the next day the manager fired me in front of all the coworkers because he said he didnt have a good feeling about me i was pissed but had been looking for other jobs at this time so not too upset i told him fine and turned in my equipment and left the next day i emailed the epa about what happened and told them i had pictures i also called the dot and told them all about the dodgy behavior and crap equipmenttrucks on the road wouldnt you know it the epa got back to me within a couple of days and i had three separate interviews with the same agents at my place i showed them pictures and gave them gps coordinates they went out to the dump sites and took pics of their own they later had me come to their building and verify employees with pictures and said it was a serious case i told them that i really reported the company out of spite even though i knew the dumping was illegal they understood and were going to take it seriously im not sure what happened or what is going to happen i know the dot wouldve done an audit and ticketed them the government can take its time to handle things so i havent asked for updates with the epa i know they were a little sidetracked with that huge gold mine tailing spill into the animas river around the same time i do have the agents cards and could call but i havent yet the owner and managers of this company were awful even despite my warnings you dont mess with the epa karmas going to catch up with them tldr a trashy construction company wanted me to illegally dump oil so i sicked the feds on them 
this is a two parter with a very statisfying ending posted originally in ridontworkherelady where it was suggested that i post it here as well part i so one day i am shopping at my usual supermarket as i so often do i have my headphones in so i dont hear whats going on round me i primarily rely on my eyes to notice what is happening anyway there i was all paid and putting my groceries into my bag when suddenly a dripping cup of potato salad appears in front of my eyes dripping oily marinade into my bag and all over my groceries i look up and see a red round angry face rraf saying something to me so i pop out a headphone rraf fucking now at this point i didnt realize one thing he was speaking english as you can tell by this single sentence where i live we speak a different language but as i speak and hear english almost all the time i dont realize that at the moment me huh rraf this potato salad is leaking get me a new one right fucking now you lazy fuck me um why his beheaviour hasnt really sunk in yet rraf thats what you bag boys are supposed to do you lazy fuck okay now i have caught on me hey asshole im not a bag boy rraf whatever you are get me a new potato salad me hey moron im just shopping here which was when he saw the potato salad in my bag rraf then just give me yours reaches forinto my bag and forces his cup of potato salad into my hands its covered in marinade he made a disgusted face and tossed it back into my carefully packed bag get me a new potato salad i have had enough by then i took my bag and walked into the store to dump his potato salad in a trash can he turned even redder before i left the store i cant even begin to rationalize how he could have reasonably thought that i was a bag boy around here there are no bag boys i was a militarylooking black jacket the supermarket employees all wear red polos there were two other people packing their shopping bags part ii later that night as i arrived at my work i was introduced to my new manager red round angry face well fuck or not his predecessor introduced him as the new temporary manager who would get the office into shape until a permanent manager would take over turns out i dont work there but i do work for rraf neither of them realize those are code words for me i know the company ceo and almost everyone directly underneath him but there are a few layers of hierarchy between them and me i am officially an independent contractor with a fixed hourly rate that is independent of my work time daynight and the office manager is supposed to call me in as necessary my secret is i am the company hitman due to the nature of the company people in manager level positions have very generous severance packages unless they are fired for cause i can see why they want to get rid of rraf long story short we both act as nothing happened but he schedules me to work full night shifts for a month which suits me perfectly fine given my hourly rate the problem is he was supposed to work these shifts instead of me strike one his computer doesnt properly log his weekly reports because of a crappy security system usually i help people with that but though luck company headquarters flags him as noncompliant strike two finally a month in he calls me into his office and tells me that i am fired that my services were no longer needed never mind that i cannot be fired without authorization of the division manager strike three he was fired the day after i was asked to supervise him clearing out his office and was probably grinning like a moron the whole time tldr asshole tries to bully me into getting him a new potato salad starts his new job as my manager and is fired a month later losing a lot of money edit to rraf wasnt a new hire he was a transfer from another office that headquarters wanted to gone as cheaply as possible
been on reddit for a while but i kid you not i just discovered this amazing subreddit yesterday have i been living under a rock anyway this is a pretty old story but it still makes me laugh when i think about it a few years ago i was dating some guy for a few months lets refer to him as dbag dbag had a quiet demeanor but enjoyed making me laugh and spending time with me there was something sweet about him however there were times when i felt like sweet dee from its always sunny when she was dating lil kevin and couldnt quite figure out if he had mental handicap dbag wasnt the brightest he once texted me that he has a lot of patients for me i asked if he was a doctor he said no i have so much patients for you that i will wait for you le sigh not to mention dbag also had a slight stutter and some serious shifty eyes now dbag was sweet but at the same time there was something sketch about him there were a few times when one of us would spend the night hed creep into the bathroom some time in the wee hours of the morning to make a hush phone call to somebody now i am not an insecure little bitch who will quickly start throwing accusations i need concrete proof first so these werent exactly red flags for me but there was this one instance i heard him yelling over the phone at somebody from my bathroom the yelling was a little muffled but it sounded like he was trying to reassure someone that he wasnt doing anything bad or so thats what the premise of the conversation seemed to be i let that instance go and forgot about it a few days later fast forward to a few days before dbags birthday i am out with one of my bffs for her birthday we go to a local bar with a few friends and happen to see all of dbags friends there but no dbag in sight im a little distracted while out at the bar wondering why dbags friends are all there but no dbag i obviously drink these feelings away and get super pissed drunk that i randomly end up making friends with one of my bffs friends lets refer to this friend as accomplice accomplice and i drunkenly hit it off it also happens that accomplice lived closed by to me at the time so my bff suggests accomplice hitches a ride with us back during the car ride accomplice and i are both spewing a bunch of sorrowful drunken statements on why is it that all the friends of the guy we are seeing was at the bar but the actual guy was not there as we both come to the realization that the guy we are seeing could potential be the same guy we discover this is not the case saved although the air is clear of potentially dating the same guy accomplice asks which friend is it im dating i drunkenly yell dbag dbag its dbag repeatedly followed by is that bad she seems shocked by this but is reluctant to say what she knows about him i end up dropping her home without finding any information regarding dbag however accomplice and me exchange numbers the next day i have plans to take dbag for an early birthday celebration some time in the afternoon i receive a text from accomplice asking if i have time to talk over the phone because she has something important to discuss im not busy so she quickly phones in the conversation goes a little something like this a so remember last night how you said you were seeing dbag me yeah a how long have you guys been seeing each other me a little over months or so a oh me is that bad a well okay im just going to come out and say this up front but dbag has a girlfriend theyve been together for over a year me son of a bitch turns out accomplices bff is dbags girlfriend this son of a bitch had me as the other woman being someones option has never been my style so i am quite furious accomplice and i devise a grand master scheme to expose dbags cheating ways to his girlfriend that very night during the birthday celebration dinner i planned out i make the arrangements that i will drive dbag and me to dinner so in the end of the grand master scheme he will be stranded but the grand master scheme itself accomplice and i plan for dbags gf to show up at the end of dinner at i pick up dbag from his house my insides are crying with delight at the very thought of exposing this motherfucker but i must remain cool calm and collected while being in his presence we get to the restaurant and have a great time i am being extra nice and sweet to him asking him what does he want for his birthday and promising to take him out to a fancier restaurant on his actual birthday then we go on to talking about other things and we make this silly bet on how hes never going to kiss me ever again and i say lets bet on it because i know im never going to kiss him again hes so clueless and is laughing about it like why wouldnt i ever kiss him and that he bets i will by the end of the night i let out a laugh and say to him after dinner i have a surprise for you and its the reason why i cant kiss you we go on conversing about punishment and karma he talks about how he believes hell get punished for bad things hes done and will get his karma eventually so i say you believe in karma do you think youll get karma for cheating on your previous girlfriend because he once told me he made the mistake long time ago of cheating on one but he wasnt referring to current gf and he says yeah with no sadness to his face all innocence as if hes been a real good guy since then so i laugh and laugh and laugh some more we get the bill and since i told him ill take him out on his actual birthday he covers our dinner i text accomplice and let her know dinner is over as a matter of fact ive been texting accomplice throughout the entire night telling her my status and the silly things dbag has been saying to me at one point dbag steps out for a phone call and when he gets back he tells me his sister called because she was wanted to know where her macbook charger is accomplice texts me back saying he just called his gf to tell her that hes out with his cousin buying shoes sneaky right or better yet ultimate douche bag liar right so after he pays the bill i text accomplice saying be outside now as we step outside i stop dbag for a second and say remember how i said i have a surprise for you after dinner he says yes and as we hit the corner boom his girlfriend is there cursing the shit out of him on what a sneaky cheating bastard he is accomplice and i sit down and watch the entire fight while dbag has no way of denying me since i am there in the flesh and as the fight comes to an end accomplice and gf go their separate way i go my separate way and sad little dbag is left at the restaurant with no ride home mind you this is way before uberlyft days and sure dbag couldve easily taken public transportation or called one of his boys to pick him up but dbag is a prideful person who wouldnt want to be seen taking the bus and with the grand master scheme we also planned it on a day that all his boys went out to a city that was an hour away to hit up some club
short term redditer extremely fast admirer this is not my own story but my dads during his travel from florida to new york my father prefers to arrive on at time in anything in life hes a stickler for that kind of thing so to my amazement when he told me this awesome story of how he sought revenge although indirectly i was grinning ear to ear while listening of course my father arrives on time to his flight at boarding time the plane was a bit empty something like or rows was empty in the very back and my father loves to sit in the back because its less stressful and proven to be safer in the event a plane crashes so there is freedom to choose the seat you want and my father does so bags put in the overhead compartment empty seats on either side of him and life is bliss that is until the plane is delayed a minor inconvenience but nothing too detrimental minutes pass delayed then minutes then then everyone on the plane is wondering why this damn plan wont take off and then it happens a family of which well call the anuses father mother sons and an infant board the plane if youve ever rode on a plane before youll understand that this is almost unthinkable planes love to take off on time and if youre even minutes late you will not be able to board said plane so here goes the anuses boarding a plane minutes after its suppose to have taken off no problem there are plenty of empty seats and we can finally get rolling nope the anuses walk directly to my father and the row hes sitting in and says these are our seats well of course my father proclaims that there are a multitude of empty seats and they can just take one of those nope they want their seats on their tickets and wasnt having it any other way another thing about planes it is federal law that all passengers must sit in their assigned seats in the case of a plane crash all the bodies can be accounted for and identified although its not enforced that much the anuses must have their seats so they call over a flight attendant now fa and explain their situation the fa sides with them quoting the law and how my father must relocate having lost my father then gets up collects his belongings and proceeds to move to another seat the seat he chose his seat on his ticket which is about rows up and a middle seat only problem is there is already someone sitting there he tells the guy that its his seat and hed like to sit there now the guy looks baffled when fa chimes in and says sir there are open seats in the back why dont you just take one of those the fuck obviously outraged at this point my father then says but you just told me to move out of my seat because it was theirs when there was also many seats available now when i do the same theres a problem fa just says the same spiel again but my father doesnt relent he wants his seat now he recites the very law she used against him fa defeated then asks the guy to relocate as well this causes a domino effect and the guy goes to his assigned seat and asks to sit there so on so forth until the entire plane has been rearranged and this plane is now an hour and a half behind departure schedule the delay in the flight now sets off some red alerts for airport security and the higher ups at this terminal jet blue i believe airport police upper management and god knows who else are now at the terminal gate to inquire as to why this plane is still here they board to plane to talk to the pilot about the delay and he says that he held the plane to let some late passengers on board now thats against policy because as stated before they like planes to be on time they inquire a bit more as to the situation and its all explained by fa how they arrived late wanted their seats and then the whole plane had to be rearranged pissed off that the pilot held the plane to accommodate the anuses the anuses then asked for their seats which caused a domino effect and it comes out that the anuses are in fact the pilots family brother or something which caused him to hold the plane in the first place they ask that the anuses leave the plane immediately because you should have never been on this plane from the beginning reprimand the pilot for abusing his position and indirectly causing this entire fiasco and refund my fathers ticket because of the absurd requests by the anuses the plane finally takes off and a half hours later my father has a full refund about and the anuses has to wait for the next flight this was all at pm good flight i think so edit people are commenting that it was their seats and they have every right to ask for them yes youre absolute correct in that aspect but then you also comment that it was a full family and maybe they wanted to sit together in this aspect no youre wrong because as stated in the story there was empty rows on both sides of the plane if anyone has ever rode a plan there is usually seats per row on either side of the plane making it a total of seats per aisle aa so there was a potential seats available my father taking up of those seats its extremely unreasonable to arrive late then ask for my father to move when there was other seats available more than enough space for them to sit as a family also i do not know when or how he bought his tickets but if he bought them late anyone who has ever bought a plane ticket before knows that you dont have a choice in which seat you buy anymore its first come first served and the reason the plane was that empty anyways was because it was a very late night flight my father likes to board the plane last so when walking through the isle he saw his seat was taken to which he decided fuck it ill just go sit in the back because i was the last one on the plane and i know no one is going to come claim these seats some also commented that the plane being delayed is up to the airline unless you work for an airline its pretty safe to assume the reason the plane was held for minutes was because the pilot held it for his late family to board to plane edit grammar plus no one is denying the fact that my father might also be an asshole in this situation in my personal opinion taking revenge isnt taking the high road and anyone who elects to take revenge is inherently an asshole in that given situation very few stories on this prorevenge subreddit are they actually not assholes as well assholes dont make a saint but assholes make a right 
i had actually forgotten about this story until i read something similar on rpettyrevenge kind of a long one i am not sure if it belongs here but i have to say the effects were devastating for the victim of my wrathanyways here it goes so there i was in th grade last year at last top of my class very lanky and nonconfrontational little me had all the traits of a wild nerdus geekus enters humongous shithead hs not just your common asshole at school nobody liked him in my class for very notable reasons compulsive liar made fun of people in every way possible massive hypocrite would preach how snitching is for cowards but would be the first one to rat out other people he was specially assholey to me i was the first to talk to him on his first day and we became friends or so i thought because after a few days i realized that he was just using me to get to know other people and escalate the social chain and what do you know he started making fun of me every chance he had this went on for the rest of the school year and it was so frustrating to see him come to school every day i would celebrate passionately in my head whenever he missed class which was rarely but well that time of the year came again it was finals week but not any finals the finals i should mention at this point that hs was a below average student and not bright at all in any of the subjects and he always tried to cheat on the tests i was fairly prepared for the exams and even though the class was big somehow he ended up sitting close to me for the math exam the exam starts and as the first minutes pass hss little brain cant handle it anymore and he starts asking me questions silently and it suddenly came down on me like a bucket of cold water this assholes chance to graduate is in my hands you were not allowed to graduate unless you passed all courses at first i was reluctant to go through with it but then i remembered what a douchebag he was to me so i thought fuck it dialogue hs hey man whats the answer to number lets imagine number was a question the idiot still had to show work but whatever he wanted the answers me its pretty out of the line eh i knew he wouldnt notice the change though because the questions were too complicated for him this continued and i gave him all the other answers to all of the questions all being bogus numbers i came up with at the end of the test he didnt even thank me i mean come on i just ruined your school year the least you could do is show gratitude fast forward a couple of weeks later this guy failed the math class because of that final and he had to take math summer classes naturally he failed them too and had to repeat the year oh but not only that i caught a glimpse of him crying while his dad took him by the ear out of school to their car it was already enough satisfaction for me but after graduating and starting university overseas i went back to my country just to discover that he failed th grade again and dropped out of school he works in a local subway now and i plan to pay him a visit the next time i go back just so he can make me a sandwich the moral of the story kids is never fuck with the person that you need help from tldr highschool bully needed help with his graduating final i gave him all the wrong answers and ruined his school graduation edit wow didnt expect to get this much attention to the people wondering if he would spit on my sub he wouldnt because i would be able to see when he would be prepping it good thing he didnt work in another restaurant 
a few decades ago i was serving in the navy stationed at naval training center to do some schooling we were all young there and everyone had been in the navy about a year at most a few of us did drugs not a lot just dropped acid once a month or so usually offbase being in a strange place lsd was tough to get sometimes we were all cool and kept it quiet we were all decent students good friends and everyone there looked out for one another then there was redneck randy randy was from a small southern town where his unusual surname family were moderately welloff and very well known coming from a being a big fish in a small pond randy was entitled i mean entitled to the point of being a sociopath constantly borrowing money without repaying it copying everyones notes for class getting duty switched around to favor his plans he even doubledparked his giant pickup truck in the base parking lot just gradea douchebaggery cripes he even bragged to me one time that his grandfather was exklan i aint ashamed to say my grandaddy wore a sheet well after a few months randy stopped going to class he was still in the barracks but he never mustered for school or marched to class with us when asked about it randy said hed been moved to an elevated program elsewhere on base working on a project for the navy we all just assumed hed entitled himself into another gig which he had you see randy had become a narc around this time he also suddenly began talking about drugs not sell me drugs kindof talk more like how many drugs hed done in his life how many piss tests hed cheated how easy it is to get away with drug use that kind of thing we realized later hed been laying the groundwork for insinuating himself into the circles of those who did do drugsa group he never really associated with except to borrow money or notes after a few weeks of this he had himself a fish my roomie roomie told me randy had met a guy in another barracks who sold a bit of acid and would be willing to part with a sheet if wed keep it quiet randy had bought from this guy many times and swore he was legit although we avoided randy he kept pestering roomie into buying until roomie said ok roomie went to go meet the dealer one day after class and wound up in handcuffs if i hadnt had duty that day id have been in handcuffs too we quickly put the pieces together skipping class his talking about drugs him pressuring us to buy randy even swore his roommate to secrecy and admitted he had done this to avoid a bad conduct discharge hed been caught with cocaine and talked the base police into working as a narc to lessen his punishment his roommate told us this and informed us randy was getting discharged in a week himself why did his roommate tell us fucking randy had casually offered to turn him onto some stuff a month earlier and his roommate didnt even use randy just needed a victim and anyone would do on the day randy was supposed to get discharged he parked his truck next to the barracks too lazy to carry his stuff all the way around to the lot hed toss his stuff out the window and walk around the barracks to pick it up and put it in the truck i watched him toss two seabags outside from my window two doors down when i heard the door slam i jumped out the window and threw them into my room by the time randy got around the building his stuff was gone if the story stopped here it would have been posted in rpettyrevenge but it doesnt you see later that night when randy was driving back home we opened his seabags aside from a cd player and a case full of led zeppelin cds the seabags were mostly clothes mixed in with those clothes though were randys discharge papers including his dd underneath those we found randys address book and i shit you not a phone book from his county down south it didnt take long for the of us to formulate the plan our fury at randy was the fuel that ran the engine of our retribution we called everyone in the address book and told them what randy had done his parents his siblings his aunts uncles and cousins all got a call we called former employers and old friends of his about half of the numbers were girls in town randy was quite the ladies man they all got a call we had xeroxed his dd amp arrest report and offered to send a copy to anyone who didnt believe us only four took us up on it his family members amp former employers got a copy anyways the only people we spared were his grandparents that was the address book from there we moved onto the white pages almost everybody with unusual surname in the county got a call we typed up the story at the base library and made about copies they along with copies of the dd amp arrest report got sent out to any business in town with unusual surname as well as any business we thought might be associated with randys family hell we even sent a few copies to some businesses we saw were next to unusual surname business every law firm in town got a copy as did the local paper three people on randys street got a copy for the grand finale we called the local police department pretended to be base police and informed them of the incident reminding them he would be returning to their area in a few days they got a copy of the arrest reportdd too of course when all was said and done we made about calls and sent out about copies to the people amp businesses of randys small southern county we had a dozen or so copies left so i mailed them to randy himself over the course of months one every few weeks i mailed the last one the day i left for my ship naturally all those telephone calls and postage got to be kind of expensive luckily i had plenty of money from selling randys cd player to a guy three barracks over the cds were thrown away i fucking hate led zeppelin tldr take advantage of the enemys unpreparedness travel by unexpected routes and strike him where he has taken no precautions sun tzu
one night i was on my way home from work and needed to stop at a gas station this gas station was right off a very busy tolled interstate highway and had an attached convenience store as most do it was dark out when i pulled up i started pumping my gas and was headed to the store when another customer stopped me his truck was at the pump across from me he went on a sob story about how he just got a ticket for not having money to pay the tolls being completely out of gas and needing to get home since he accidentally took all of his infant sons formula with him when he left there was a woman with him looking through a diaper bag while he related his tale of woe and right when he mentions the formula she yells yeah all the formula is in here what were we thinking we really need to get back she said her wallet should be in the bag somewhere but after dumping the contents inside the truck cabin she lamented that it wasnt there so yeah obviously they were looking for me to give them money for some stupid reason i decide to give them the benefit of the doubt i go into the store take out from the atm and give it to them in retrospect this was such a textbook example of the stranded driver scam but i guess i was really naive but then instead of just thanking me for the money this brazen son of a bitch responds thanks but we really need another to make it home any way you could get more he also promised hed mail the money back to me if i gave him my name address and phone number at that point i begin to regret giving him anything as all the red flags are registering in my mind at once both of these people were very unhygienic greasy hair very poor teeth consistent with meth use dirty clothes the mans pupils were dilated a lot more than would be expected under the bright lights of the gas station and he was especially twitchy likewise the woman was pacing around muttering to herself in feigned concern so yeah they were both probably high also looking at the contents of the diaper bag sprawled across their trucks interior there was plenty of trash but no baby formula i thought to myself if im going to ruin these peoples night i needed to be sure so i agree to get more money but first ask him can i see the citation you got my cousin is a state trooper and could probably take care of it for you i just need some of the information on it as i jot down his licence plate number on my phone he checks his pockets before saying oh hmmm i have no idea what i did with it its ok ill just pay it no big deal so you dont have money for gas but paying more than on a traffic ticket is no big deal bull shit i now also noticed the state of his license plate didnt match up with his story pissed at myself im making my way back into the store and the wheels in my head are spinning how can i get back at this asshole have them kicked out nah then theyll just go to another gas station and victimize someone else call the police eh they might not get here in time im a few feet from the door when genius strikes i turn and call over to him if you want you can take my ez pass for the tolls i dont really need it anymore its right on the dashboard the door should be unlocked oh thatd be great thanks i go into the store and pretend to use the atm while im actually using an app on my phone to cancel my ez pass i report their fraudulent activity to the attendant and hurry back outside i told the man i couldnt take any more money out of my account sorry hes disappointed but didnt press me im grinning like a smug idiot on the inside get into my car notice the transponder is gone and drive off i pull over a few minutes down the road and call the ez pass office by some stroke of luck theyre open late that day and im able to speak with an actual person i explain to her that when i got into my car just now i noticed the transponder was gone i already cancelled it but wanted to make sure it was all set she confirms that its deactivated and i can come pick up a replacement for a small fee eh not today she asks and i tell her where and by whom i suspect the transponder was taken giving her their license plate number and address of the gas station she promises to pass the information along to the state police perfect a day or so later the state police call me to say theyve recovered my transponder and needed me to come in to give a statement of course i obliged while there i tried to pry more information on the fate of the con artists but they werent very forthcoming at all luckily i told my cousin the story and she said shed look into the case for me according to the report they got cctv footage from the gas station showing me giving the man money and then him taking my transponder when i went back into the store afterwards the meth heads got back onto the interstate and stopped at the nearest rest stop where they presumably tried their scheme again before moving on to the next one to repeat the process eventually they got off the toll road and onto a different highway when they drove through the ez pass toll lane they got flagged for not paying and were pulled over a few miles away at this point i was satisfied having caused them to get a gt citation but that wasnt the end of it the cop notices somethings up with the driver and calls for backup when they arrive the police officer gave the guy a field sobriety test which he failed and was arrested while this is going on the woman flipped out and started running she doesnt make it far before they catch up to her whereupon she resists arrest all in all the guy was charged with dui not his first time either possession they had some meth in the truck theft by deception for the i gave them and theft for the transponder the truck was impounded and the guy got a large fine for operating without insurance along with the fine for not paying the toll the woman was charged with possession and resisting arrest she also had a record all in all pretty sweet revenge they ended up only being tried for the drugrelated charges but im still very satisfied with that along with the fines it gave my cousin the cop a good laugh too
a few decades ago i worked it for an upandcoming tech firm it was a good place and i enjoyed working there however the company finances were chronically lean which occasionally resulted in some cutbacks as a result i wasnt surprised when an announcement was made that there would be a wage freeze and that all dept budgets were being cut what made this financial episode memorable was how a senior vp dealt with it it happened that the vps amp ceo had been deferring taking some bonuses contractually due them im not sure of the specifics but apparently the deferrals had gone on too long and the company finally had to pay them out to forestall unrest among the rankandfile the vps were told in no uncertain terms that they were to keep the news of the payments quiet one vp however went out and bought an expensive highend european sports car and started driving it to work this in turn raised some eyebrows among those whose previouslyokayed pay increases had been put on hold and whose department budgets has been slashed this vp was also more trouble for the it dept than the rest of the company put together about this time there was one particularly unpleasant interaction where hed gone off on us due to a problem hed been experiencing for a few weeks due to his own ineptitude and unwillingness to cooperate with us to try amp fix it this last episode was one which justified payback our parts cabinet soon contained a ml syringe and a bottle of castor oil about once or twice a week one of us would happen to squirt a syringefull of castor oil up the tailpipe of his new car the result of this was when the exhaust pipe of the car heated up enough to burn off the castor oil the car would emit a massive plume of opaque smoke since he lived close to work the pipe wouldnt heat up enough to start smoking during his commute making it seem to happen randomly needless to say this took the enjoyment out of the pricy new toy he was showing off given his personality it was a given that hed go back to the dealer and read them the riot act when they couldnt find anything wrong with the car eventually they did find something to fix which wasnt covered by warranty and apparently cost him a sizeable chunk of change the injections then ceased for a few weeks only to start up again by this time he was disgusted enough with the car that he sold it at a bargain price just to be rid of it the new owner got a great deal the castor oil didnt damage the car at all since it was at the end of the exhaust pipe and downstream of all sensors etc edit spelling clarity
asshole neighbors have a habit of turning music right up loud every weekend with a shared ceiling thin walls and their tendency to go off and threaten us when we ask them to turn it down i found a tiny simple solution yesterday switched g off got my phone on edge and browsed some heavy sites while moving it around the wall bingo found a place that makes that delicious zzzzt zzit zizt zit zzzt of an edge connection through their speakers and let it do its thing radio went off within minutes and every time it goes up again back comes the edge bliss havent heard it above a murmur since
let me start off by saying that i love my dog this story starts a couple years ago in a small but very nice and quiet neighborhood most people own their homes and everyone takes pride in ownership besides the house next to minethe house next to mine is section meaning government assistancewelfare pays all the bills and usually some form of trash lives there this certain piece of trash this story is about well lets call her fraggle rock because she looks like one this bitch moves in and immediately starts partying i mean like an every day all day booze and drug fest she is selling pills smoking crack and doing heroin on her back porch throwing trash drug bags everywhere all over my property brings her druggie crew around my house and keeps my family up really late with there loudness i really dislike her at this point but i ignore her her boyfriend is extremely violent and they beat each other constantly the year old child she has is dirty looking neglected with behavior problems and has to witness this shit it was awful but none of my business i spoke to the fraggle one time when she first moved in i explained i had a really big dog and to just ignore her as she barks a lot but will eventually get used to her like she had with the other neighbors we were actually removing a swing set off of the property line when i spoke to her our foot privacy fence was put up about foot away from where our property actually ended and i seen she had a small child and i did not want to get sued because her child got hurt on it my property the landlord lives in a different state and is very absentee he is also an asshole fast forward a couple months most of my family went on vacation to another state for an entire month and as soon as i returned not even hours later i am hauling suite cases from the trunk of my car mr out of state landlord comes by and says his tenant is complaining about me looking in her windows and we need to stay on our side of the fence that brings about an argument first of all i can be on my property all i want nd of all we have been out of state for a month and havent been on that side of our property since the fraggle moved in and we removed the swing set i told the landlord i will be moving my fence closer to the property line i am unsure where all the accusations came from her crack smoking probably had everything to do with her bogus claims i was now agitated with this bitch and she even went as far to call city officials the day i started moving my fence after we called her over and showed her our survey spikes around this time i noticed our mastiff who was treated badly by previous owners and behaves like a guard dog has taken a particular disliking for them so i start watching out my window when i hear her growling i wish i hadnt seen what i saw one of her daily regular buyers was jamming a stick through my fence and into my dogs face he actually broke my fucking fence doing it i ran outside and screamed you fucking asshole you will fucking pay for this i was upset and my dog had a mark on her face he ran inside and i seen the fraggle peeking out from behind her curtin fucking laughing the very next day the little boy is beating on my fence with a hammer and my dog is on the other side flipping out i yelled at him to get his mother now but she would not come out to talk to me a few more days later the kid is throwing dirt into my dogs eyes over my fence the next day he is back with the hammer i go to city hall and ask the lady there to contact the landlord asap and give him my phone number i never got a call back another incident happens with the same original drug buyer friend of hers he is smoking a blunt with the little child only feet away and my dog is barking i am right there in my back yard and see and smell it all he kicked a big ass hole in my fence and actually kicked my fucking dog that was it i had it i went to the police not something i would normally do but i did not want to lose my dog when one of these asshole gets bit i talked to the cop we discussed the entire situation the parties drug deals the domestic violence and he told me the only way to get her out since she was section and the landlord was uncooperative was to call in her drug deals and she would be kicked off government assistance as soon as she was convicted it only took one day of calls and i shit you not fucking calls the first day all with license plate numbers the next day i heard her yell talking to one of her drug fein girlfriends her voice was always loud and shrieky so i can hear and understand most of her outside conversations from my living room about a bunch of her friends getting locked up the day before and she didnt understand why or how this was happening at this point i believe the cops called cps they started coming around but she was not answering the door one day she left the child unattended and he was playing on the main street a family around here noticed and walked the little boy home but no one was home to watch him cps was waiting out front this time she somehow still had her kid after that but not for long there was one more incident with my dog a different druggie friend decided it was a good idea to pelt my dog with rocks i couldnt believe this was happening still and was beside myself the hell i was going through i was in my yard all the time because i had to be it was a serious inconvenience to be in the yard every time my dog wanted to be outside but i felt it was the only way to make sure these people didnt harm her i lost my mind that last time and started pelting this guy back with rocks the fraggle was on her back porch knocked out and she awoke briefly to let out a snorty the pig laugh like it was a fucking game the fraggle likes to drink and drive since the drug deals only got her buddies busted and not her i decided i would wait and watch and call in her next drunk driving adventure she had to go it didnt take very long a few days later her violent scum bag boyfriend stole her purse and jumped into a car that was waiting and took off i heard her scream my pills give me my fucking pills i see her stumble to her car completely shit faced hop in and peel wheels in hot pursuit i call it in the poor child was outside in the snow barefoot that is a perfect example of her priorities the cops arrested her and i knew that because cps came the next day after the child never went to school they found the little boy there all alone just how he had been the whole night the bitch was too worried about getting in trouble to disclose to the cops she left the child a year old home alone really sad but hopefully he has a new family now or at least will one day the fraggle returns a day later no car and she stops going to whatever job welfare forced her to have the violent boyfriend must have been in jail still from her purse snatching incident because theres a new scumbag boyfriend hanging around with track marks visible a mile away well violent boyfriend gets out of jail and runs up in the house i seen the whole thing as my doggy is freaking out dope head boyfriend and violent boyfriend start fighting there is a bat and blood i decide this is my chance to get the cops in the house and finally get these fucking pieces of trash out it was a sight cops come guns drawn dope head runs inside and violent bf runs through the other neighbors yard in the end they all went to jail unfortunately it wasnt the complete end when she got out of jail she smashed the back window and squatted there for about a week i didnt bother calling the cops because i knew the house was getting damaged and it felt good knowing the landlord would have to fix it and section will not pay for damages fraggle is gone ive seen her once around town shes living on the streets lost everything and she really had it all and her life was so easy living off the government i told that fucking bitch not to fuck with my dog she should have listened 
before i got clean i bought most of the oxycontin i was hooked on from my friends husband she had a good heart but he was a giant turd eventually he ripped me off i paid he said hed have pills soon i never heard from him when i called to check he got hostile said some nasty things refused to give me anything i wasnt surprised but i was furious and i never saw him again i was the librarian at our local newspaper at the time one morning on my way to work i passed his house and saw a bunch of cop cars in his driveway lights flashing i was super curious and admittedly hoping he was in trouble for something and when i got to the newspaper i went straight to our police reporter and asked him about the cops he had no idea so he checked a source it turned out to be something mostly trivial ive forgotten the specifics and then asked me what the big deal was this reporter happened to be a good friend so i happily explained that the house belonged to my former drug dealer who had ripped me off and was a giant turd i said something along the lines of you should print something about how awful he is after i finished ranting about it i said adios and went upon my day if anything i expected a oneline brief under police news instead the next mornings paper included a fairsized article covering the previous days events at my dealers house and then delightfully recounting all his previous criminal activity in detail his full name and address was mentioned over and over and it was the best thing ever
several years ago i had a coworker who was absolutely worthless she called in sick at least every other week with some malady was always out running around chatting and socializing instead of working and just generally leaving the rest of us to fill in for her another coworker who i will refer to as fed up were really sick of dealing with her because we were the ones expected to take her calls and take care of her customers when she was out or away from her desk i had complained loudly and often to my manager to no avail for some reason she took it as if i were challenging her authority rather than believing i had a legitimate complaint one day she basically told me she was sick of hearing about it i obviously had a personality conflict and to drop it or else well i dropped it but i was pissed finally one week everything came to a head worthless handled one of our large clients and we were getting a lot of calls from their customers so many in fact that my supervisor told me and fed up that we needed to help worthless because she couldnt possibly handle all the calls i was livid maybe if she spent her time at her desk instead of running all over the office she could handle the calls anyway i did what i was told but i fumed the whole time worthless was also in the habit of leaving early every day at about min to closing shed shut down her computer and go sit in another coworkers office and blab for minutes and then they would leave together while i was still working one afternoon after she left i still had about of her unanswered calls so i sent them back to her desk i figured if she had time to leave early she had time to return her own calls well apparently the next day worthless tattled to the boss because she came to see me about the phone calls id had it i told my boss exactly what happened and why i sent the calls back i guess this time she agreed with me because we didnt have to help her with calls anymore the whole time this was going on worthless was bitching nonstop about this client she was so pissed about having to take all these calls and griped all the time well she decided to vent on facebook and idiot that she is made disparaging comments about one of our biggest clients online as if thats not bad enough she was friends with at least coworkers all of whom saw her rant most of them were friends in facebook name only because in reality very few people could stand her so one of her friends screenshotted the page printed it out and gave it to fed up we then mailed the screen shot of her rant to the hr manager from outside the office and sat back and waited two days later worthless was escorted from the office rumor has it that hr had her termination paperwork ready before they even called her in edited to fix some typos and make the story read a little more clearly
i apologize if this if overly long i am trying to condense it as much as possible without losing too much of the feeling of the story my story started the day before orientation into my college program you see i applied for a very competitive program and never received an acceptance letter till the day before class started i was also working the day it arrived so i never really got the letter till that evening after some begging and pleading i managed to convince the dean of the department a heartless compassionless bitch of a woman to not count that absence against me this program had a strict attendance policy where you were given three absent days a semester and would be kicked out on the fourth they made this very clear and i didnt want to take any chances so i fought for that first day a little over a month into the program i was asked to go see the dean i had been sick for two days prior and i assumed she was going to give me a warning about the attendance policy others i knew had the talk with her already when i got into her office she asked for my security badge i handed it over slightly confused she then says im sorry to tell you but youve broken the attendance policy and can no longer attend class in this department i was irate my eyes were watering from a combination of fear rage and confusion i explained that i only missed two days she tells me i missed the two sick days which i did she mentioned that i also missed orientation which i did but she said she wouldnt count against me and then she said i missed a fourth day which i actually could prove i didnt with a signed and dated test i took that day i explained this to her and told her to look at the test which i still had with me she ignored my proof i kept trying to talk some sense and reason into this emotionless wench i made sure to point out that i just spent on tuition and on bookssupplies she didnt care she didnt interrupt me but she wasnt listening when i stopped talking she says you can leave now the confusion and fear subsided and the rage intensified i blacked out for a moment and literally wiped my arm across her desk ensuring nothing was left on it when i was done i broke her picture frames and ornaments she had and even managed to crack her laptop i stormed out knowing security would be there very shortly i went directly to the administration office to get a refund that is when i realized she did this the day after refunds would be given that smug cunt scammed me even more pissed i decided to go to our off campus pub where i had planned on meeting some friends later i was in there a couple of hours when one of my professors walked in she was a younger professor and attractive i had been flirting with her since i started the program so i could be on her good side when it comes time for marking she tells me she just heard i was kicked and my friends in class said i would probably be at the pub she tells me she has seen the dean pull this stunt a few times and never really thought about what was happening until now the dean was scamming students by kicking one out after refund deadline and bringing another in ultimately getting double the tuition for a single seat i was slightly drunk and my now former professor said that i needed to meet her the next day so i assumed she had a plan i hoped she had a plan the next morning my former professor arrived and i hopped in her car i drove to another college in the same city my second choice but equally good i figured she was going to use a connection to get me into a program and i was right but thats not where it ended her former professormentor was also a lawyer and happened to work at this college we sat down and explained the situation to him and he agreed that we have a case at least to get my money back he wrote up a letter to the dean of the department on my behalf we sent it through registered mail within hours of sending that out i received a phone call from the lawyer telling me that the dean has agreed to refund my money in full for tuitionbookssupplies i was happy with that outcome but still felt like she was getting away with doing this to other people i explained my concerns to the lawyer and we devised a plan my former professor was sent an email every time someone was kicked so that she didnt allow them into her classes all professors got this she sent me all of them and i tracked down the most recent ones and found that of the were in the same situation the lawyer and i compiled a list of those names drafted a letter on their behalf and sent it to the dean of the department and the president of the college this time it took a few weeks but we were both asked to go in for a meeting we got in and the dean was there along with several board members and school lawyers we told our story and the dean had her chance for a rebuttal in it she explained that she was being nice by returning my money since i missed four days expecting this i had the proof that i did not miss one of those days and presented it to everyone in the room the meeting ended on that note a few days later the lawyer was called by the president of the school the school had terminated the dean for breaking the schools ethical policies they also agreed to contact each of the students she had personally kicked out for false reasons and refund them their tuition in full i was so excited that i called my former professor to tell her the good news i took her out for dinner to thank her for all of her help in this situation we dated for a few months after that dinner while we were dating we heard the former dean took a much lower paying job in a much less desirable city tldr school expels me for false reasons to get double tuition for each seat in the program i get her fired i get myself and several other students full refunds and i date one of my hot former professors 
someone told me to share this here my little brother is probably one of the most kind and purehearted kid i know one of those people who would rather let a spider outside rather than end its life i on the other hand am a cruel and unforgiving person when it is needed im years older than my brother and was in high school at the time so i would get home about minutes before he would we lived within walking distance of our schools so everyday we walked rather than take my car good exercise one day my brother gets home with some unusual bruises on his forehead and arms after some poking and prodding he finally told me that some older shit heads follow him home on their bikes and punch him on occasion this did not sit well with me in fact my blood boils just recollecting this event instead of letting my fury get the better of me and simply beating the spit out of them i decided to formulate a plan the next day i waited for them a couple of blocks away from my house envelope in my hand until i finally saw them riding behind my little bro i could already hear their little mouths spewing so much shit their assholes mustve been jealous i approached them my brother sees me and stops a look of worry and confusion on his face i give him a quirky smile i walk up to the ring leader and extend my hand with the envelope drawing his attention away from his front tire in my best douchestyle voice i say yo man im having a killer party this weekend here is the address and shit the look of awe and happiness that came over his face was priceless being invited to a high school party was a big deal back then i guess i should mention that as he was accepting my party invite all while telling me how pumped and excited he was he failed to notice me nonchalantly jamming a small but solid piece of wood into his bike spokes he began to pedal but is quickly upended with a squeal of terror his face met the ground with a sound i will remember until the day i die he cried lost a tooth and did something nasty to his nose his posse ran to his aid i patted my brother on the head and asked him how his day at school was as we walked home never had any problems after that also the envelope contained a piece of paper that said fuck you tldr bullies harass and abuse my brother on his walks home from school i sabotage one of their bikes and the asphalt sexually assaults his face
this is a crosspost from rpettyrevenge i made over a year ago before this subreddit existed this is definitely a more pro than petty revenge story i apologize for walloftext and if this one is a little too technical this involves a somewhat popular cardbased trading game mtg i tried to strip out as many unnecessary details as possible to make it easy to read plus i dont remember them all i usually am not the one to take revenge since im riskaverse however in this case i found it was the most logical thing to do since i knew ahead of time that the other guy was going to try and screw me there was this fellow in my high school his name was david he was one grade above me and he was a complete asshole a compulsive liar and a compulsive cheater often times during lunch hour students would get together at the tables to play card games and such i usually got involved in these games as well david did too but not as often when he did i watched him honestly this kid fascinated me since he was completely blatant about his lying and cheating i remember distinctly watching him play a game of magic the gathering with another student and i would watch him take even cards at a time when he should have only been drawing his opponent was completely oblivious to this and was so concerned about her own cards to really pay attention to what david was doing i just kept my mouth shut pretty soon he had something like cards in his hand while his opponent had it was very ridiculous i usually avoided playing with him but i must have played with him at least once he would continue to cheat in the open until you called him on it of course he would try to lawyer himself out of it or tell me i got it wrong he would try to change the rules of the game to benefit him in the moment for his specific situation he would throw a fit if you tried to argue and would only back down if you got the whole audience to agree unanimously that he was wrong playing him was an exhausting experience since you spend more time arguing and watching him than playing the game it was at the time and i had played some magic the gathering mtg i was nearly finished with this game since all the great expansions came out before i even got involved and people with money held all the power cards i had dropped my own money in the new expansion fallen empires which turned out to be one of the worst expansions ever made in the games history therefore i was pretty sour and was basically giving up the game since i didnt see how i could ever catch up a guy i knew alex decided to organize a starter pack tournament where the players had to compete with only the cards they got with the starter pack this sounded like an interesting variation on the game and i thought i might join to try and squeeze some fun out of this game i was quickly losing interest in incidentally david joined this tournament now his reputation was well known by alex but he let david join anyway the logic being that he needed people even if those people were assholes there was only something like people in the tournament so it was hard to argue with that can you guess whom my first match was against thats right it was fuckface himself david now i didnt want to lawyer and argue with david the whole game since that was no fun at all if i was going to play him i wanted to completely royally screw him over and embarrass him in front of the whole player tournament a sort of preemptive revenge for the shit i know he was going to pull on me knowing that he was going to cheat ahead of time gave me some unique opportunities i felt it relieved me of any ethical obligation to play a fair game i needed to stack the deck in my favor so to speak let me explain what i did so each player was given a starter pack and one booster pack mtg revised edition for those who care this gave you an assortment of cards that made overall fairly weak decks most games resulted in waiting for the person to get enough land to play a monster and start doing damage against their opponent any sizeable monster in play usually results in that player winning since our decks were so weak in order to give yourself a chance of getting the right cards you need to strip out all the fluff that was going to do you no good so your cards were divided into your active playing deck and your reject pile you only played with your active deck at the end of the game the winner gets to draw at random a card to keep from the losers active deck or your reject pile its the winners choice this is important later my deck had an unusually useful card for this sort of tournament called a demonic tutor it essentially lets you go through your own deck and pick out the exact card you want if i ever got this card it would be my key to winning since i could pick out the only monster i have that actually does damage so now i have two chances of winning if i draw my monster or draw the demonic tutor david also had an unusually useful card in his deck as well i think it was some kind of rare card and he cherished it so much i dont remember what card it was but i remember it did him no good against me my goal was to completely win the match and then pilfer his precious rare at random to prepare i took my uberpowerful demonic tutor card and oh so gently put a tiny fold in the top right corner of the card this way if you put it in a deck you can see it stand out from all the other cards you only see this if you know what to look for when we met for our match we get to browse each others cards so we know what to expect i browsed through his deck and took out his precious rare to admire while david was too busy looking through my cards i put the same tiny fold in his rare card and put it back in his deck i didnt have time to check if it stood out so i crossed my fingers next we shuffled our cards since i could see where my demonic tutor was i shuffled it carefully so that it was below the mark in my deck so when he cut my deck theres a good chance that the demonic tutor would end up near the top if i didnt end up getting this card i have a second chance of getting the monster instead luckily when he cut my deck he cut it above my demonic tutors location so i was good to go in that department next i cut his deck but since i could see where his precious rare was located i made sure to cut the deck so that his card was as close to the bottom as possible and wouldnt show up during the match david was too selfabsorbed to suspect that anyone other than himself might have evil intentions things are going well so far and im starting to feel bad for david im starting to question whether what im doing is the right thing these doubts are quickly erased by subsequent events we start to play my job here at this point was to watch him like a hawk and call him out every time he tries to cheat and try he did he tried to do the whole multiple carddraw on me i called him out on it david tried to act like it was an accident this got the tournament organizers attention and david a verbal tongue lashing from alex alex basically told david to stop acting like an asshole and play the game this had the effect of crucially destroying davids credibility and getting everyone in the room on my side i shined a spotlight on his douchey ways so to speak next thing he did was try to lawyer his way to do something that was clearly against the rules of course i made a calm but loud enough scene for everyone to notice and eventually called alex over again to adjudicate alex told him hes full of shit and ruled in my favor soon enough i had the demonic tutor in my hand after several turns since it was near the top by this time i had all that i needed but the monster i pretended to act joyful and surprised when i threw down my demonic tutor and went rifling through my deck to get that monster davids face started to go red and his body was very agitated the next round i threw that monster on the table with gusto i celebrated with yes and i cant believe it the other people in the room were starting to admire my skill and good luck they were really watching my game now and clearly wanting to see me win the best david can do at this point is pull out a monster to block me or somehow get rid of my monster knowing that the only card that has a hope of achieving that is his precious rare safely at the bottom of his deck i was inwardly confident but acted nervous to lead him on that he actually had a chance of pulling one out every subsequent round i would attack him with the monster pinging his life down of course during this time nothing good came out of his deck slowly his chances for winning dwindled and his fury grew then it was over i celebrated and other people in the room marveled at my amazing play style david was so mad he was shaking whenever he spoke he was petulant and angry while i was making a big show of celebrating my good fortune david had already planned and executed his next cheat he took both his active pile and his reject pile and mixed them together as soon as the game ended if you recall these piles are supposed to be separate so that i could choose which pile to pilfer from by mixing them up he reduces the chance that ill randomly take any of his good cards including his precious rare i immediately called him out on it as hes mixing them together he starts arguing about the tournament rules and his interpretation of them i make a big show of arguing and acting like i was cheated honestly it didnt matter that he did this since i could still see where his precious rare was this final act of cheating showed his petulance and completely ruined any reputation he had in the room i called over alex the organizer to adjudicate and demand restitution clearly there was no way to unmix the decks unless you have an entropy reversal device so the damage was done alex called david an asshole for what he did and alex tried to placate my hurt feelings acting hurt and angry i told him fine lets get this over with david had a smirk under his face thinking hed finally pulled one over on me oh how wrong he was while making a show of concentration and trepidation i spread his deck out and made a show of going after a card but changing my mind a couple times finally at random i pulled out the card with the tiny folded corner and with drama turned it around to show everyone at the same time that it was the precious rare immediately david let out a scream of anger that made the whole room silent he quickly packed up all his crap and stomped out of the room but i had his precious rare everyone was overjoyed that i had completely and totally demolished david and dealt a slice of righteous karmic justice at the same time we all agreed how much of an asshole he was and that he got what he deserved honestly it was the highlight of the tournament david dropped out of the tournament after that and no one was sad to see him go i never told anyone about my deception i think people are happier thinking the universe conspired against david to deliver justice tldr i outcheated the cheater by knowing the future
this revenge story was posted in altrevenge years ago once upon a time there was a man who owned a piece of land next to a thriving restaurant now this man had owned the land for a long time years and it was undeveloped he had bought it cheaply but it had great highway frontage and he had always dreamed of building a little used cars lot or gun shop on the tract as his retirement pastime now the man had had the tract zoned as a commercial lot when he bought it but when news leaked about the upcoming development the restaurant owners petitioned the zoning board to overturn the commercial zoning and reinstitute the original agricultural zoning by the way all land in the mythical state of kentucky is zoned as agricultural by default this was unfair illegal and generally rude but the restaurateurs brother was the county zoning commissioner so things naturally turned against our wouldbe entrepreneur after fighting the good clean playbytherules sort of battle and losing our wouldbe entrepreneur gave up he decided to accept the county zoning not to see the tract go idly unused the enterprising retiree decided to pursue another business venture he raised hogs lots of them two hundred and four to be exact on his little acre tract for those of you unfamiliar with the climate in timelost kentucky the summers are downright southernly in their humidity and heat as you can imagine a rather malignant odor grew up around the thriving hog farm patrons of the restaurant ate elsewhere anywhere else to be exact in a matter of weeks the zoning commissioner reversed his earlier ruling returning the commercial status of the lot it is another caveat of kentucky zoning law that land can always be used for a purpose lesser on the scale of hierarchy than its current zoning everyone especially the restaurateur was surprised when the hog farm remained in operation nothing not even substantial financial offers could convince the new farmer to quit his now beloved occupation exactly months and four days after the opening of the hog farm the restaurant closed its doors for good the farmer in a fit of depression ceased hog farming and decided to open a small sporting goods store instead it remains there to this day alongside his newlyacquired restaurant

this happened during my final year of school which in comparison would be the final year of high school i was in a boarding school due to a problematic family situation my roommate this year was the fattest meanest person i have ever met in my life and she continually made my life a living hell my problems with her was that she continually stole my stuff especially my food and snacks when i locked my stuff in my locker she threw fits like an angry toddler another thing i really hated about her was that she would always eat junkfood at night often noisy stuff like chips or crackers and the following morning the package wrappers would be all over the floor i would always step on crumbs it was fucking nasty the staff did nothing about it as they had no proof of her actions finally i had enough of her and when the staff didnt want to do anything about the situation i decided to do so myself one morning as i was leaving for school i opened the window just the tiniest bit when the students left for school a teacher was supposed to make sure none of the rooms had any windows open but when opening the window just right it would appear to be close while actually being open during lunch i ran back to my room and went in through the window this way the staff in the house wouldnt see me the lockers in the room had number locks with only three numbers i tried out the different combinations until i eventually found the right one i hid every food and snack item in my roommates locker underneath her bed when i locked up the closet again i put some metal in the locker slot a trick i had been taught by one of the other students basically you just have to pull a bit harder to get your lock up but to an idiot it appears as if your lock is stuck i then went back to school and no one even suspected i had been gone in the evening the day continued as normal at pm all students had to be in their room and do homework i entered my room to the sight of my roommate fighting her locker and wildly complain about how it wasnt working she couldnt get the lock to open at all finally she blew a fuse and started kicking and trashing at the door which made all of the staff turn up in our doorway she complained about her locker specifically her lock but one of the staff members manged to get it open pretty quickly when her locker didnt hold any of her precious food she blew yet another fuse and started crying about people stealing her stuff one of the staff members asked her whatever she was sure she didnt just misplace it and she spit all over his face as she explained to him in great detail that she would never misplace her stuff the staff started searching the room and pretty much immediately found the stuff hidden underneath her bed they are of course mad as hell about the fact she misplaced her stuff and then thrashed her locker in a fit of rage the episode made way fro me to complain about how i felt unsafe having to be in a room with my roommate obviously she had anger issues i was assigned a new roommate mission complete

i was on a business trip to a client in philly located just far enough away from the city to be a very expensive cab ride but not so far as to warrant a rental car i flew down got an airport cab there was there for a week being picked up and delivered from my hotel by taxi and on friday the client called a cab for me to return to the airport the driver of my cab was distracted and not driving with safe attention to the road so after a couple miles he hit another car fortunately it was a lowspeed collision just barely not fast enough to deploy air bags and everyone walked away unharmed however i had to wait for the cops to show up to give a statement and i insisted the cab company send another car with another driver to take me to the airport a couple minutes into waiting i realized the driver had left the meter running which i insisted he stop all told i was there maybe an hour between waiting for the cop talking to the cop convincing the cop not to force me to go to the hospital i had a black eye before the accident and the cop was really worried that i was terribly injured and too delusional to realize i had been hurt and waiting for a new cab to show up so while id left early for my flight by the time i got to the airport i was going to have to rush to make it youd think if you had a cab company and your driver had a car accident with a passenger in the car youd see to it that they got to their destination safely and hope they dont sue you but not only did the second cabbie run the meter and ask me to pay but he told me the owner of the cab company had insisted he get the fare from the first cabs meter and insist i pay it too he had the decency to look ashamed about all this so i wasnt too nasty to him personally i told him calmly that i recognized that the law allowed that i could be charged for the trip although good business practice would dictate otherwise but that if i hadnt been charged i would have given him a good tip while now hed get no tip as i was offended and then i told him what to tell his boss i was going to do you see my client there was a major bank it wasnt bank of america but a few years later it got bought by bank of america so you can think of it as being that size and they had people in to consult with them and work with them often and they always used this cab company for all the local travel i would be going back there in two weeks so i simply phoned up my client on monday morning to let them know about the accident and asked them very nicely to please find another cab company for me to use when i would be there my contact at the client was of course horrified and made sure that they their employees and their consultants and contractors would never be using that cab company again

this happened last spring it was for a final project in my sophomore year of high school i joined a group for a total of four including two good friends however we all just assumed someone knew the last guy none of us knew quite how this indian kid named dan got into our group whatever dan was a smart guy from what we knew we planned a study session at panera bread the following saturday group text everyone confirms they will attend even dan of course dan doesnt show up no biggie right we bust our asses on the script and decide to let him get away with just writing the analysis of our script dan once again agrees the next week we were going to film the project at my house now it is important to note here that due to poor planning on our part we had only two more days until the final was due and we hadnt even filmed yet we instruct dan to bring the analysis of the script with him to my house when we film but guess what he hasnt done the analysis like we told him to he tells us he can write it while we film but that wasnt the deal we need everyone in our group to film for full credit so dan says he will come film with us than write the analysis but doesnt show up what the fuck dan we missed off season practice to accommodate you and you dont show up at this point we realize he is just dead weight but we were mad we wanted revenge we realized we had been instructed to pick our own groups technically the teacher had no idea who was paired with who so we compiled all of our group texts including some where this guy referred to us white guys using the nword and printed them off then we shot the film sans dan and i gleefully wrote the analysis solo the next day the day before its due dan is texting us like mad trying to get us to film with him but oops sorry dan we only took one day off practice to meet with you and that was yesterday we finish practice i tell dan who had already been waiting hours at this point that we had already shot the day before he sends a flurry of angry texts demanding that we shoot the entire project over again to which we all reply no come the day of the project we had already emailed the analysis video and script to the teacher we show her screenshots where dan has clearly neglected his responsibilities and refereed to us with the nword dan is called to speak with her privately right before we present and is not in the class for the rest of the period we later found out he had received a warning for his use of language with us but even better dan received an f on his project and his grade dropped two letters it was glorious and nobody ever worked with him on a project for the rest of the year in any class he did learn his lesson but not before getting the lowest passing grade in the class that year edit unnecessary bolding
hello all this is gonna be a long one just warning you now this happened about a year ago now in october of i had just split with my exwife and was moving into my own place with a friend of mine well call himdickbag or db for short db had just split up with his girlfriend of almost years we decided to move in together as we were good friends and had known each other a couple years upon moving day i moved all my things into my room aside from my desktop which i put downstairs and setup attached to my desk with locks my laptop which was worth quite a bit was stored in a storage compartment in my closet that he didnt know about as i chose that room specifically for this purpose things were going well for the first weekthen my wii disappears ended up finding it at his exs place as he had taken it over for his kids without asking me i unhooked it and took it back told him if they wanted to play it they can come over to our place same with my ps a few days after that i find him snorting coke and pills and lock up my stuff even harder not wanting him to sell it off but low and behold he somehow finds my laptop and pawns it for cash i called the cops they said there was no proof so i went pawn shop hunting and found it but they wouldnt let me see it as it had already been sold even though i argued tooth and nail it was stolen property and i would sue unless they let me try to access it as the hard drive was busted and i knew that within that short time span they couldnt have replaced it ended up not getting the laptop back as they had a signed paper with a false name on it and gave him cash for it man i was fucking livid at that point onto the next part i confronted him about it told him to get my laptop back or get the fuck out of my apartment cause i was the only one paying for bills and food he called my bluff and didnt leave so i packed up my stuff called the cops on him snorting drugs and gave them full access to enter the home and left last i heard hes living under a bridge after posting bail somehow for all the drugs they found and his kids dont even want to see him nice knowing you dickbag hope you have fun living on scraps the rest of your life tldr guy stole my expensive gaming laptop he got caught i called the cops and moved out he got evicted cause he couldnt pay and the landlord took his stuff after days as is the agreement when he didnt move out edit forgot to mention he took my brand new car out for joyrides when i was working and its not hard to spot driving around town as im the only one with one 
this may not quite be a revenge story as there was no sole perpetrator whom was targeted rather that i simply got tired of being awoken at am either way i couldnt find an appropriate sub to put this in so here we are during my college years i lived in a small town that had two main landmarks the university i attended and a latter day saints training campchurch the towns residents consisted entirely of college frat boys retirees and lds for the most part its a very nice town to live in i wouldnt hesitate one moment to move back but there were a few small things that bugged me the most notable of these was that my condo was only a block away from the lds church which meant that roughly twice a week my doorbell would go off at about am now i am not a racist or religionist however i am a sleepist anybody who wakes me up unnecessarily is bound to find that out very quickly sadly this chain continued through my first semester of college being that i was working a fulltime job while attending fulltime college i had very little time to spare getting more than hours of sleep in a night was my version of sleeping in so you can understand that the doorbells at am quickly became an unacceptable nuscience it was time to put a stop to this nonsense at first i posted signs nobody read them i disabled the doorbell they knocked i put up two signs they still ignored them i photoshopped satanist paraphanalia and pasted it up on the windows at the front of the house that only fueld them more to show us the light i parked my car to block the pathway to the house they climbed over the bushes i called and filed complaints with the church my words were ignored finally id had enough i pulled my roommate into a meeting and we plotted we plotted real hard tuesday morning we were prepared and like clockwork only a few minutes after am there was a knock on the door i opened the door shirtless i had blood all over me and was carrying a knife and the leg of a boar that my roomate had recently shot on a hunting trip the lds boys were shocked but were determined to talk to us so i invited them in they walked into our living room we had our satanist paraphernalia plastered to the walls and even had a fake human skull hanging from the ceiling fan on the television we were playing a hardcore porno with the speakers turned up quite loudly the boys sat and i offered them some glasses of vodka they declined i took two shots gtviper so what i can i do for you two gtlds we are here to talk to you about jesus gtviper who gtlds our savior jesus gtviper im not good at spanish but i think you are pronouncing it wrong gtlds jesus the son of god gtviper oh i see hold on let me get my husband hes fascinated about this kind of thing important note i am a straight male i stand up and walk down the hall to the bathroom where my roomate is currently hiding gtviper dear the boys want to talk to you gtroomate right now gtviper yeah they want to talk about jeezes gtroomate cant i finish gtviper i dont want them to be waiting gtroomate fine the bathroom door opens and my roomate steps out he is completely nude except for shaving cream covering onehalf of his netherregions the effect was that he was halfway through he steps out into the living room and with a voice that would make richard simmons seem straight says gtroomate oh haiiiiiiiii the look of shock on the boys faces was priceless gtlds um we can come back if you guys are gtroomate nonsense tell me about this cheesus gtlds uh okay roughly an hour went by my nude roomate interrogating the boys as i continued to slaughterclean a boar on the kitchen table while intently watching the boys make nevous glances at the skull porno and the door finally we let them go and cleaned ourselves up we had to steamclean the floor later to get the bloodstains out but it was totally worth it we had whole years of uninterrupted sleep update the mods contacted me asking me to show some proof and the information that i have provided them seems to have been satisfactory if you think this was made up then you are a minority there has been some argument over the timing of the lds boys not all doorbell rings were at am on the dot however since our apartment was so close to the church we were always some of the first in line generally speaking the knocks were tuesdaysthursdays between am 
so let me start this story by saying that i am a cyclist i transit to work via bicycle because generally it seems to be the fastest and cheapest way for me to get to work i have also just moved and have just realized that busses to my new area stop running after pm so you know now more than ever it is the most efficient means of travel given that i havent moved far my route to work hasnt changed very much i take a slightly different route but ultimately it all connects to the same road i have taken countless times before without issue today i am riding along said road and i come up to a bus stop full of bogan teenagers couldnt be older than blocking the shared bikepedestrian path im not an ass so i slow down and gradually make my way through them while im doing this one of the teens who was spraying deoderant on himself decides hes going to be funny and spray deoderant in my face i stop i get off my bike and walk towards him asking him what the fuck he thinks hes doing he thinks im going to hit him and i dont blame him for thinking that and takes off sprints around the corner since i have left for work early i figure i have enough time to confront this kid a little bit more and get on my bicycle and chase after him i couldnt see him anywhere this old couple was walking along and i ask them did you see a little turd run by here they respond that he went in the alley way so i pursue him he sees me and begins running again at this point while im cycling after him i want him to realize that im not just your run of the mill responder that he has messed with a crazy woman so i start yelling at him the craziest stuff i can think of at the time keep running turkey im gonna get you im going to make you my bitch over and over with a couple of fucking variations here and there i chase him around the block a few times past the old couple past a man in a suit who saw the whole thing his friends are laughing at him the guy in the suit is laughing at him the old couple just seems confused eventually he is puffed out even though he can dodge me easily since he is on foot i have more energy than him again i cycle to work every day hes puffed out and says him maam him maam im sorry him all i did was spray deoderant on you me you know that is called assault mate me you sprayed it in my fooken face for some reason i said fucking this way me if it was anyone else you might be lucky to be standing him well im sorry can we hug can we shake hands me i dont really want to mate at this point i deliberate as to what exactly i am going to do should i accept and let him go or should i humiliate him more in front of his friends who are now watching our exchange i was a teen once i know what teens respond to better so i took his hat i cycled around the corner out of sight to where this originally happened and put it in the bin next to the bus stop i ride past the man who has taken his suit jacket off since it is damn hot and he asks me did you get him i respond i got his hat i ride off into the sunrise get to work and have a shower moral of the story is dont fuck with cyclists on a shared pathway we arent cars we arent in heavy traffic that will keep us moving away from you we can stop and we can turn around 
backstory my baseball team in high school was a coop with another local high school so every day the baseball guys from our school would get on a bus after school and ride to the coop school for practice to combat my thirst at practice every day before school i would fill my gatorade squirt with powdered gatorade mix then shortly before getting on the bus for practice after school i would fill my bottle from the water fountain to have cold gatorade for practice for a few days on the bus during my senior year we would get to the coop school and all of my gatorade would be gone from the bottle you see some of my friends and i would be sitting in the seats facing the aisles so we could talk so my back was to my bag and my other stuff and i wouldnt be paying attention to it one of the guys would sneak under the seats to where i was sitting take my bottle sneak back to his seat drink it all with one of his friends sneak back to my seat and put the bottle back without me noticing i acknowledge this was partially my fault for not paying attention to my stuff but at the same time i was from a small school and knew all the guys on the team and therefore didnt think i should have to worry about my teammates stealing my drink every day after the third day of it happening or so i decided that was the final straw we boarded the bus the next day and all was normal or so they thought i placed my stuff in the seat and intentionally faced the aisle of the bus waiting in giggly and gleeful anticipation for the bait to be taken about minutes into the drive i took a chance and sneaked a peek behind into my seat and my bottle was gone shortly after i heard from the front of the bus what whats wrong man i looked up to see one of my teammates john look over his seat and angrily look at me with my bottle in his hand what did you put in here unable to resist any longer i busted out laughing and revealed to the entire bus full of my teammates as loudly as i could you just drank my piss bahahahahaha prior to the bus ride that day i didnt put gatorade mix in the bottle and instead took a pee into the bottle before boarding the bus after i peed into my own water bottle i filled the rest of it with water from the fountain to mask the warmth of my pee and fill the remainder of the bottle as to not make the perpetrator suspicious shortly after discovering that he had just drank my kidney koolaid john momentarily freaked out ran back to my seat and started punching my shoulder while i rolled with uncontrollable laughter to this day i have never had any sweeter revenge on anyone in my entire life tldr john stole my gatorade so i made him some of my special urinade
so my street is kind of a main thoroughfare for students from the local high school it more or less takes them directly from campus to most of the fast food restaurants because of this there is always tons of litter and kids doing stupid shit more times than i can count ive looked out the window to find mcdicks bags or drinks or sometimes entire pizza boxes thrown into someones driveway so shortly after school starts for the season im already sick of this shit next time someone litters im gonna rub their god damn nose in it not helping my mood is the fact that not even half a block away there is a garbage can the shaming part its laundry day im in shorts and bare feet nothing else im a yearold dude tho this wild herd of students all bearing items of litter walks in front of the house and im watching them discretely out the window im thinking okay maybe one of them will drop a cup and ill tell him to pick it up even better i get the holy grail some fat kid whips a full drink right at the garage door and runs quite sadly a few feet down the block ive got him in my sights i rip the door open and tear after him i call out hey fatass are you kidding me and all of his friends turn around but he pretends not to hear his friends just stand there white as sheets as i grab the fatty by his collar and toss him to the ground i yell you wanna throw shit at my house and he starts blurting out im sorry im sorry someone paid me to do it with this terrified look on his face this kid is a minor and i could probably already get in shit i let it slide tell him to smarten the fuck up and go back in they all continued on without a word the shaming part fast forward about a week so today our pumpkins are still on the steps from halloween not even near the sidewalk mind you but all the way up in front of the door the usual lunch rush comes and im reading a book on the couch in my shorts laundry day again my girlfriend hears this scream from outside and i slowly walk over and watch these two teenage girls kicking our smashed pumpkins down the street about a house over now i dont know if they did it or if theyre just kicking the pieces but my girlfriend says i thought i saw someones head in front of the window and she goes out there and watches them as she steps out this construction guy in his dump truck pulls up and says it was the girl in the pink sweater i think her name is ashley fuck yeah construction guy so we jump in the car and pull out of the driveway it should be noted that at this point this rude douche canoe student with an ugly mustache just guns it around me in a sunfire remember this guy so we catch up to the girls pull into a driveway and my girlfriend who is pregnant btw fucking chews them right out asks them why the fuck they felt like doing that told them how hard we worked on them etc they apologize look like theyre on the brink of tears and shaking couldnt be older than gf asks what we should do i say they seem sorry i think we should just let them go but thats not good enough for my girl she tells them if you dont clean it up im coming with you to the school and were gonna tell your parents they definitely dont want that and she marches them all the way back to our place ten minutes later theyre covered in pumpkin and the mess is clean construction guy is still there and he gives me the nod then guess who shows up mustache douche in his dirty ass car asks them if they want a ride and they start getting in they mention how dirty they are and my girlfriend being the considerate person she is asks if they want some napkins to clean up at this point we are being way nicer than we should but whatever they decline and tear off down the street now im standing there with my girl and im like this is when he rolls down the window and screams something well he rolled down the window but he flipped the bird instead you just had to fucking do it didnt you we were gonna let this go not anymore so i start sprinting my ass down the street not shirtless this time i have a jacket and shoes on i lose him after a couple blocks but by the time i get to the corner hes actually dropped the girls off and hes coming back yes my girl is in the car she caught up to me i see mustache across the street slowing to a stop sign and i run over there yelling heeeeey buddyyyyy his face goes pale and he just guns it through the stop sign girlfriend turns i jump in and we fly after him he stops further ahead and motions us forward so i get out and walk towards him he fucking starts driving off again what is with this coward wont talk to me unless im in a car is this what our culture has come to cant face me unless youre in your bubble some time around here he makes like hes going to swerve right into my girl and smash the car fuck that pissed me off i run at him and hes just saying youre a goof fuck you etc and i just told him to be a man and step out of the car which he didnt do obviously so he tears off again circles around comes back and sees us and then turns down a side street so we follow him and end up back at the school immediately he runs out and calls over a teacher crying about how im harassing him so i politely tell the teacher how him and his friends vandalized my property made obscene gestures and threatened my pregnant girlfriend with vehicular assault best part is we caught a lot of this on camera thanks to my dear girl so she goes in and shows it to the principal who requests we email him all of the evidence we have so we did went home laughed it off and finished the laundry and we have an embarrassing video of them cleaning up pumpkin and being cowards update as i was writing this mustache douche actually came back to the house with some people in the car and scoped the house out pointing and talking he circled the block and came back again we have informed the authorities but ill keep you guys updated edit for clarification im gonna address some complaints people have i did not drag my girlfriend along for the ride i actually ran after the mustache kid on foot leaving her at home it was entirely her own prerogative to catch up in the car she is not my slave i am not her master she has her own free will and can think for herself thank you as for the car chase it really wasnt he ran a stop sign before i got into the car we drove about kmh very casually down the street after him to the next stop sign i got out again he did that swervy shit at our stopped car and took off i turned around and sat in a driveway we saw him come back and very slowly drove after him around the block and to the school the whole trip was probably about three blocks going half the speed limit so aside from his actions with the stop sign and the swerving there was no danger also these kids as i say are at least years old possibly older i am there is not that much of a difference between us when you are and commit a crime you can be charged as an adult therefore i do not consider them minors furthermore i did not actually injure or hurt anyone yes i tossed the fat kid he made a violent action towards my home so i did something about it i wouldnt go further than a shove i could have punched him choked him out stomped him but i didnt because i didnt want to i dunno about you guys but in my town when someone flips the bird its a sort of challenge i called him out i chased him down i was willing to engage in some good ol fisticuffs if thats what he wanted but he very clearly didnt want that and i wouldnt have done anything to him unless he threw the first punch i was honestly just thinking about kicking the mirror off his car eye for an eye so to speak until he made like he was gonna hit my girl that deserves at least a bit of justice dont you think update nothing yet guys hes been around the block a couple of times but i think he got the hint ill post a followup if anything happens still waiting to hear back from the principal of the highschool too tldr fat kid throws litter gets thrown in return like the trash he is girls smash our pumpkins and have to clean it up on camera then their friends flip the bird try to smash our vehicle pull bitch and cry to the school and get reported to the police
hi everyone this is my first post on this sub i wasnt sure whether to put it in pettyrevenge or here since the effort was pretty petty but the results were pro this story takes place on my families farm its a small hobby farm we bought about years ago and has two lots cut off the front corners which were sold to two older couples before we bought it they were both very nice and there was lots of space and privacy so life was good on the farm we have four dogs but the two who will be the stars of this story are two whose job it is to protect the farm and the animals from a very large pack of coyotes who roam the area they do this by going to the edges of the property and making a lot of noise to discourage the pack from even coming towards the farm about a year ago the proverbial shit hit the fan one of the couples moved into a retirement home and left the house to their son and his wife unfortunately these two were the classic definition of city slickers they jumped at every cricket chirp and frog ribbit and were especially upset when they learnt it was a minute drive to the grocery store they also brought a very small chihuahua and a very fat cat with them a couple of nights after the couple had moved in we got a phone call complaining about the dogs that they were barking at the couple and threatening their cat this was strange behavior for the dogs so we apologized and brought them to meet the couple so the dogs would recognize them as friends while we were there we found out that they had been letting their cat roam outside at night we told them that was a bad idea and probably bringing the coyotes in closer and forcing our dogs to come deal with the threat a few hours later we went home thinking everything had been taken care of we were wrong we continued to get phone calls complaining about the dogs on a daily basis and since you can only repeat yourself so many times we eventually gave up on trying to reason with them and started locking the dogs inside through the day as well as ignoring their phone calls since we werent responding anymore they called animal control who having met our dogs on numerous occasions told them they were being ridiculous after about a month of daily calls to us and animal control we got a call saying that they had bought a gun and if our dogs came near their property again they would shoot them this was not something we wanted to risk so we immediately went out and installed an invisible fence around the property closest to the house and barns that absolutely had to be protected this left almost a kilometer of land between the dogs and the couple and made sure they would not be protected harassed by the dogs any more about a week later we found out that their cat had been killed and eaten by coyotes almost immediately after the fence had gone up and a month after that they sold the house and moved i was more than happy to see them go but i do feel sorry for the cat edit tldr dogs protect farm from coyotes city slickers move in with fat cat threaten dogs dogs get fenced in cat gets eaten by coyotes neighbors move away

editi realize this post is getting a bit dated but many of you asked for an update of the aftermathso aftermath is at the bottom i repaired an ipod touch for a girl i met at work i initially offered to repair it for plus the part which was she offered to make it a flat later instead of coming by my house she arranges to have some guy meet me at a local grocery store a couple blocks away when they pull up my friend and i notice she is in the truck but sitting very close to the douchebag drivingxt cab pickup f i think this was a bit confusing because i know she is married to a deployed marine from our convos at work he hands me the ipod through the driver window and i see that this thing is in bad shape i cant tell if it was a long drop or a throw but one corner of it is smashed and the casing was slightly bent the digitizer was still functional but the shattering made it practically unusable the next day i spend an hour or so carefully peeling off the screen and broken bits and complete the repair after trying to straighten out the corner as best i can i message her to let her know that its done they arrange a meet again not at my house but at the end of the street i meet them there show them the ipod and explain that since the corner was bent the screen doesnt fit as well as it would and it would be a good idea to let it sit under some weight to make sure its pressed flat she said it looked great and handed me some money i assumed the two bills she handed me were a and a it was relatively dark so i waited until i was on my steps to check it sure enough its only two s gtlt needless to say i was annoyed and i messaged her instantly a day goes by without a reply so i send another message she asks if was ok even after seeing that the part shipping was of what she gave me so just to make sure it is her intent to stiff me i ask if she means for me to accept for the repair and she says i guess so of course i proceed to tell her to find someone else to fix the other devices we discussed she decides to call me an ass at that time her boyfriend takes over the conversation he threatens to stomp my ass and slips up by stating that i am not to talk to his lady that way amused i decide to press it and toss a couple jimmyrustlers his way he responds predictably with more threats and i cant help but laugh at how tough he is trying to act likely in a hormoneinduced rage meant to both put at ease and impress his married girlfriend i continue to mess with him for ten or so messages the last of which are in the rd image the messages not included show a convo about how shitty of a job i did and it wasnt perfect and he could do better interesting being that he wasnt her first choice he lobs some more bs to which i reply with more bs mainly just to piss him off and the block which i had been anticipating came shortly thereafter as soon as i was blocked i knew they couldnt see my posts so i posted all images to fb which of course caused some gasps and laughs the final image being a screenshot of a message sent to her husband containing a screenshot of his wifes boyfriends initial threat and slip up i didnt include his reply out of respect and since it isnt exactly relevant i can say that he was shocked by the message and thanked me for the info apparently he knows the guy too although he trusts her and has no reason to trust me a stranger he was grateful for the info and he would deal with it in his own way i thanked him for his service and said take care tldr married woman stiffs repair guy for then has bf assume the conversation when repair guy calls her on it repair guy gets his jollies off causing general drama and proceeds to inform her deployed marine husband of her cheating with screenshot this may be slightly petty but it wasnt ideal material for pettyrevenge being that it wasnt something lame like flipping the cd in someones optical drive or changing a label on something etc etc update i have not been in contact with any of the parties involved since the incident occurred but i do have news regarding the aftermath i was browsing one of the local classifieds groups on fb and to my surprisehere is the chick that screwed me outta trying to sell some shit haha i knew immediately that she had created a new account because i was blocked by her dbag bf i clicked her name leading to her new profile which has a creation date of nov th it doesnt say shes married but her last name is still the same and whats this her town of residence is the very town she was moving away from just a short while ago dbag is apparently her new and she liked his fb page dbags woodworking lolol so much for k a year inhome appliance repair bummer i was almost sure that was all working out for him another thing that surprised me was her photo her head was shaved she previously had shoulderlength hair now she kinda resembles the dorky kid from undeclared so to bring this all to a close the apparent aftermath she moved away to be with her husband who is in the marine corp florida they probably separated as a result of the fiasco i helped unfold and is now back in town with dbag no less who apparently couldnt tolerate a year lul and instead opts for small time carpentry shes trying to sell anything and everything on a fb classifieds page including popular board games as if everyone doesnt already have three of these stashed somewhere and shes not lookin so hot infact the picture gives me the impression that shes not really pleased at all i imagine shes upset that she no longer has the big truck the motorcyle the steady income the husband abroad providing all these things for her but in reality i feel shitty for potentially being the catalyst for her separationdivorce and ensuing unhappiness but at the same time i dont feel bad the marine is free and gets to use his paychecks on himself and surely got his big truck and motorcycle back im not perfect and ive made mistakes and to this day im still reaping what id sewn years ago mistakes of this magnitude will teach you one thing and it is a fact of life karma is a frigid bitch fin
my freshman college year myself and a couple other friends had cars but many of our peers did not whenever we went out as a group youd chip in towards gas to whichever car you were riding in one guy though mike would always change cars at the gas station it took me awhile to realize the scam as soon as wed pull in hed get out to use the restroom then get in another car for the remainder of the ride hed say he already paid the car he just vacated if asked i never questioned that but it dawned on me that id never actually seen mike hand over any cash i asked my other friends about it later and everyone went through a round of sonofabitch when we realized what he was doing the next time we went out we picked a destination much farther than usual miles away from school when we stopped for gas one car did not pull in but parked up the street the other cars one he was in each went to the pumps as far apart from each other as possible sure enough he gets out and heads over to the other one but we both pulled out and left him there i have no idea how he got back to school but we saw him the next day i am pretty sure he never went anywhere with us after that either edit re being in rpettyrevenge or rregularrevenge i did not know those even existed i did read the sidebar before posting and thought this fit here your story should be about getting back at someone who wronged you in generally an interesting andor funny way the response was coordinated between myself and two other drivers and was in reply to someones douche behavior we discovered was chronic ill add this was well before everyone had a mobile phone bag phones were still rare then if he used a phone it was from a pactel booth dropping in coins he got back by either being extraordinarily lucky and catching someone in the dorm who he could talk into driving miles to retrieve him or by hitchhiking back there was no uber or lyft option and even cabs would have been few out there my guess is that he hitched back this happened in northern ca where when miles out of town you are in a long stretch of wilderness until you hit the next town whatever method he used the getting back part would have completely sucked i dont remember much of the aftermath but i was quite likely relieved when i heard or saw that he made it back but only about this much gt lt 
disclaimer i honestly think this is more rpettyrevenge than rprorevenge but this fits the rules here more than it fits the rules there i also think its petty because we didnt have one final coup de grace against him still with me heres the story gtthe year is theres me who ill name kevin omalley i dont hide who i am on the internet but im not gonna make this an rtifu by doxxing myself and getting banned theres my wife who well call alice omalley and my boss who well call mark green who she never met gtalice and i worked in seattle for computerstore i was and we had kids i was teaching for them you name it word wordperfect excel quattro access quark photoshop basically every single thing that existed at the time alice was doing inside government sales we got job offers in dallas at the corporate hq i would be training at the flagship store down the street and she would be doing major govt accounts gtbecause i was young and hadnt finished a university degree i had trouble getting certification to teach in texas my manager told mark all about me but he didnt really pay attention when i got there he quickly realised that it wasnt legal for me to teach the public since i didnt have tea certification he also decided hed rather have someone else however i was wellconnected within the company and was friends with people far above him he tried to drag his feet on my tea certification as my sponsor i could get it i had enough college and work experience but he was trying to force me to quit gtmark goes to a big convention in la for government sales as we sold training to the govt as well alice being in govt also has to go the company has gotten rooms for everyone at the same hotel the first evening i get a call from my wife gtthis guy was trying to touch me on the elevator he was propositioning me touching me and cornering me gteww gross i say well youre a big girl tell him to fuck off knee him in the balls or something gti will if i see him again she replied gti thought nothing of it that was that gta few hours later i get a call from my wife she seemed pleased with herself you could hear her smile beaming through the phone kevin she excitedly blurted out youll never guess what i did gtim somewhat perplexed as im thinking shes won the lottery or something uh what did you do gtyou know your manager mark gtyes yes alice of course i know mark hes the bane of our fucking existence hes threatening our ability to be able to live fuck that guy what gtin the most serious tone i had ever heard out of her she says mark is the guy who was hitting on me gti pause and say ok so what happened gtalice says well i was at the bar and he comes up to me and im sitting there with my nametag having a drink and talking to karen my coworker he comes up and starts touching me fondling me touching my ass i tell him to stop were all wearing nametags from the convention but he wasnt he looks at mine and says omalley and starts to pause gtshe goes on i ask him what his name is he says mark mark green i instantly figure it out i say to him dont you know my husband and he looks kind of dejected kevin kevin omalley and his face turns white as a ghost and he leaves gti say to her go tell virginia the training director right now go tell her right now virginia is a friend of mine because i created and developed the first internet instruction course for us in and we marketed it to the entire company it was really successful and part of the reason i had a name for myself in the company gtalice goes and finds virginia she tells him how he kept touching her and hitting on her and didnt take no for an answer how he was dragging his feet on my tea certification how he didnt know who he was hiring and failed to tell us this was even a problem and virginia calls me and i explain all of this gtvirginia is an oldschool feminist and the only female executive older lady she was not impressed mark returned early from the conference my tea certification happened quickly as in people from up high in the company pulled strings to get it done gtmark wasnt long for our location our store was the flagship we had the biggest accounts and it was by far the most prestigious before he was moved laterally to a different store with no future my wife used to call me at work and call his direct line to ask for me she would pick me up at work and come in with our kids he would close his door every time she was there every time i asked him for something i got it and i made it a point to ask him for stupid shit all the time and then he left for the crappy store and eventually left the company for good the rjusticeporn element to it was that it really helped my standing in the company as well as my wifes to bust this guy we both interfaced with the executives regularly in the end before he left i ended up in a regional position above him but laterally i suppose the irony was that he was trying to make me quit but they put him in a position with poor bonus structure and he ended up quitting and they didnt have to pay out the severance package of his contract
dont know if it belongs here but grievous bodily harm is involved so maybe growing up i had a friend well call dave as far as we ever knew dave was likely the result of a mother who had been doing a number of drugs for most of her pregnancy as well as heavy drinking when he was around his mother dumped him and his little brother with his grandmother and promptly ended up in jail for attempting to rob a bank his grandmother decided that his younger brother was an angel and he was somehow evil dave had issues doctors said he had all of the signs of antisocial personality disorder at around and ended up being sent to a special school where he basically retracted farther and farther from human interaction that is aside from with me dave was inhumanly smart liked sports could play any musical instrument that you handed him within a week and we had basically everything in common in spite of what doctors and his family seemed to think dave was a totally great person he was such a good friend that one time when he came to me and admitted that he had feelings for a girl i was dating and she admitted to liking him i immediately gave them both my blessing and remained friends with him not her though she for some reason was angry that i was not upset that they were happy thats another story though dave and i ended up taking martial arts together for years as well it was an awesome outlet for me since i was home schooled and didnt get to meet many people and him since he turned out to be amazingly talented at martial arts i was not shocked by this the thing was as cool a guy as dave was with me and our tightly packed group of friends he was in fact a smartmouthed sarcastic bastard he did not like fighting but more often than not i could assume that if dave was speaking to someone we were going to end up in a fight we were year old boys not too bright all around so daves grandmother has decided one day that she would punish him since his little brother had broken down the door to daves room it was obviously daves fault for wanting to have privacy by her logic and so he was sent to reshingle the roof of his house this is apparently a fitting punishment for wanting privacy i found out and as you do when your buddy needs help i suddenly found my ass up on a roof with a hammer pulling off old shingles and completely terrified of the i just went and looked a few minutes ago its not story drop on the other side while i am up on the roof i hear voices i slowly and fearfully walked my way to the edge of the roof almost straight below me i see a local dealer well call him fats everyone else did is threatening dave he is threatening him with a bulge in his coat pocket which no one can see now we live in baltimore city there is about a chance that there is actually a gun in that pocket im trying to decide what to do when he pulled his hand out and to my surprise he is holding a cheap fleamarket style butterfly knife of the kind you get when youre like and think youre a badass now well i can only partly remember what happened at that point he cut dave and it was fairly bad there was instantly blood visible i then took one giant step off of the roof with the idea in my head that i would land on this fucker and kill him i had completely lost it at the thought that my friend might be dying and i was totally fine with the idea of going to jail for killing this asshole goodbad news for me i did not land on him and instead hit the ground directly in front of him doing damage to my knees that ive never really recovered from goodbad news for him i did not kill his ass but when i fell my forearms came directly down on his collar bone shattering it in a completely horrifying and magnificent way how i didnt break my forearm i dont know but this kid looked like someone had hit him with a wrecking ball he screamed and took off right away i can only assume shock is what kept him awake because we heard days later that his collar bone had been broken in like places as had several of the ribs below it from the impact dave as it turns out had gotten a cut across the forehead and was otherwise fine it also turns out that dave was getting ready to hit fats in the face with a claw hammer when i came falling out of the sky like some tubby ragepowered meteor according to him the sun blacked out for a brief moment a flash of pale white boy descending from the heavens and then two fat guys on the ground screaming he had no fucking clue what happened he helped me inside and after a bit we with all of the expert medical knowledge two year olds can muster reasoned my legs were not broken i then limped home and went to bed while he went back to working on the roof we never saw fats again after that turns out a lot of people did not like him and when he was suddenly completely unable to defend himself he thought it was a good idea to leave maryland for good edit sorry if this is a bit rambling a bit drunk and remembering old friends i havent seen in years wanted to share the story with someone edit added line into story from comments about my pale ass falling from the sky like it was the dawn of the final day edit doctors said he displayed all of the signs of antisocial personality disorder not that he had it sober now sorry for the misunderstanding edit finally got off my ass and walked up the street to look stories from where i jumped not makes sense in retrospect since we would have had to place the ladder at the lowest part of the roof fear and bad memory was definitely making me remember it as being way taller
i met my buddy pat in the early s when i was a sophomore in high school he was a nam vet living in a dilapidated old apartment in a crummy smalltown on floridas west coast the units were pretty run down with cars young barefooted illwatched children running about and the various kind of yard detritus one might suspect i guess hed taken a shine to me because i was intrigued by him working on various cars boats and the fact that hed sneak my year old self beers just to have someone to chat with also pat was in the midst of a nasty divorce sometimes these things happen when you decide to cohabitate with a cocktail waitress years your younger but such is life shed taken him for nearly everything which wasnt much to begin with leaving pat almost completely broken hearted almostbecause she left him moose a white poodleish dog of questionable lineage moose was great pat would take him to bars dye him green for st patricks day and they were always inseparable if pat was working on a derelict boat while sucking down a parliament and mainlining busch light in the degree heat moose was right there with him all day long about months after the divorce pats ex called demanding the return of a beloved childhood stuffed animal a small unicorn evidently her father had given it to her hed recently passed and she realized it was the only remaining item shed forgotten to abscond with im sitting there witnessing the phone conversation wondering what the hell shes bitching about when pat closes the call with fine you worthless whore im going out of town but will be back in a month you can collect your fucking unicorn then slam pat looked at me and a devilish smile crossed his crocked teeth after explaining the call he leaves the kitchen to fish through some dusty closet boxes and retrieves the plushy unicorn moose he calls and moose comes running per command eyes wide and tailwagging moose sits and awaits masters command moose heres your unicorn and pat tosses it down to the runt dog who eyes it for a moment it may be fair to mention at this point that moose is not neutered he then proceeds to doggy fuck the ever living hell out of that unicorn like the antidote was lodged somewhere in its fluffy soul word travels fast in shitty communities and soon moose go get your unicorn was the favored saying damn near everyone would pass by and mutter those words only to have the poodle run inside get the stuffed love toy and proceed to befoul that thing like nobodys business a month passes and poor unicorn was looking haggard missing an eye and all dignity bitch cocktail waitress finally pulls up one muggy florida day in her chevy celebrity to collect her prized possession after some unpleasant words exchanged she demands her unicorn a small crowd had gathered and pats moment had arrived finally after losing everything it was time to mutter the sweetest words of redemption id ever previously or ever will hear again moose go get your unicorn 
roughly years ago i was a nave kid and went to a car dealership to buy my first used honda i had enough money saved for a down payment but the stereotypical used car salesmen upgraded me to another more expensive car it had just been traded in earlier that day so it was still in the service shop i got the service checkoff sheet claiming all the work that was done and the main one being brakes replaced i take it home and after a few days of adjusting to the new car i notice that my brakes are squeaking i call the dealership and they tell me over the phone that hondas do that made a record of timedatename of rep i ask around and sure enough they confirmed what the dealership had told me over the course of the next months the brake noise upgraded from a squeak to a squeal and by the end of the th month a grinding was heard i bring it into the dealership and they tell me your brakes are completely worn to the nub you have maybe left at best that will be to repair the issue i speak to the service manager sm who was no help i find the salesman and anyone else involved with my sale and none of them can help me as the checklist states brakes were replaced ive never heard of brakes going out in less than miles i finally get a hold of the general manager gm who flat out tells me son youre a kid guys like you race fast and brake hard ive replaced brakes at miles before he wont do a thing for me they replace the brakes but one of them isnt tightened on well and on my way home the brake pad falls off its housing its still attached by tangling and i call a tow truck on the dealerships expensive i have the guy take the ultra long way back as they bill by the mile i pick it up the next day and nothing is said about it i sulk for months telling my story to all that care to hear me finally a friend of a friend hears me out and is familiar with what to do he helps me to write a letter to the better business bureau and notify news agencies im to write help me articles to newspapers even call up talk radio stations for advice i takes several weeks and nearly envelopes later i had stacks upon stacks of letters going out to various agencies and companies two months go by and i had gotten a few news agencies that were interested but the big one was the bbb my case worker chad says they will do an investigation and informs me that this isnt the first time said dealership has done this before mine was the first where detailed records were kept i had additional maintenance records going into the same dealership as well as secondary opinions over a year had gone by since i bought my car and i take it back to this dealership for the last of my scheduled warranty maintenance before i do so i go to a bbb trusted mechanic and have him confirm my brakes are good miles and nearly brand new still at the dealership i avoid everyone that might recognize me and i speak directly to the mechanic he does the last of the warranty maintenance and i ask him to check my brakes knowing full well that the service manager and gm had written notes about me for future reference chad warned me of this he confirms what chad had told me would happen your brakes are almost worn out you must ride them hard as they were replace about months ago you should probably get them replaced again i ask the guy to write all this down and he refuses to make it on the official paperwork but caves on dealership letterhead instead namedatetimethe works i fax this information to chad and some time later i get a phone call from the gm of the dealership i dont remember all of the half hour long conversation but he was attempting to bribe me with free service vehicle upgrade with a pay the difference catch blah blah blah if i would retract the unfair accusation i made against him and his store i was milking him for all it was worth and i finally said you know being that i drive my car like a typical kid i would be thrilled if the dealership replaced my nearly new tires brakes and oil and transmission fluid i am hard on cars after all he was verbally pissed at my attempt to rub what he said in his face he hung up claiming i was being unreasonable i never did get my refund for the brake job i never should have paid for it took years and several more complaints from other customers but the dealership was forced to close down and sell chad tells me it was mostly because of my detailed recordkeeping and persistence that led to that dealership going under tddr dealership sells me a car with bad breaks and lies to cover up their mistake i call the bbb and the dealership is eventually forced out of business edit if the mods want proof this happen i will gladly give it to them upon request done sorry to have upset a few of the redditors edit wow thanks to ufunkyskunk and uflclimber i found out a lot more what actually happened bbb probably took my evidence information to the da or attorney general and the manufacturer probably got involved with enough evidence they were able to bring down the corrupt dealer or force them to sell
not me but my brother a couple years ago he is a mechanic and tow truck operator in a small town a while back he gets a call for a job a guy wants to buy his son a used pickup truck but its in another town and needs some work the client says its a lot of work apparently but it should be a fun dadson project he hires my brother to pick it up my brother gets our there and its in surprisingly good condition the big thing is the tires are shot he tows it to his shop calls the dad and explains he actually got a pretty good deal brother offers to install some new tires and do a little minor work and the truck should be ready to drive dad happily agrees and gives the work the go ahead two days later and the truck is running my brother takes it over to the house and leaves the bill on the seat five or six days go by with no word from dad so my brother calls in to ask how the trucks running great says dad so my brother asks about expecting payment dad says hell be in first thing in the morning the next morning rolls around no dad same thing for a few more days my brother reaches him again and now gets a little run around with dad trying to say the trucks not running so well dad doesnt really know vehicles though so his bluff isnt really working my brother says hes willing to work on other problems or recommend other mechanics but he still needs payment for work already delivered at this point dad starts mumbling something about how he wont be scammed and hangs up dad ducks my brothers calls for a week so my brother calls the local police to explain what hes going to do then calls me to ask if i want to see something funny i say sure and he picks me up and takes me to this guys house in the afternoon on a friday the truck is parked on the street and has been driven recently a police car pulls up at which point my brother says hi to them then starts loading the truck onto his tow truck after a few minutes of beeping teenage son comes out of the house freaking out hes a brand new driver and thinks he parked wrong or something but my brother explains that his dad didnt pay son goes inside to call his dad my brother loops around the block for a better angle then backs the truck completely into the driveway he pulls out lifts the truck on jacks removes the tires them lowers the whole thing onto a couple xs then puts another bill on the windshield for the time he spent at the house we all then leave and my brother closes up his shop before hearing anything he doesnt hear anything until wednesday next week and its a call from mom apparently dad spent a few days lying to his family saying my brother was trying to scam them but eventually fessed up mom was fuming because her car was blocked in the garage the whole time by the truck she came down in person and paid my brother cash for everything plus more to come back and reinstall the tires the best part unfortunately i didnt get to see but mom made dad apologize to my brother in front of their son when he reinstalled the tires
just discovered this sub and love it thought it would be a great place to share my story two years ago i lived in a touristy area of ontario and worked as a server and bartender at a fairly well known canadian restaurant chain it is no exaggeration to state the front of house manager foh assistant manager assman and general manager gm are among three of the dumbest people i have ever known in my life my four months working at this place were fucking awful and soul crushing but the tip money was unreal so i could tolerate it this was essentially the management dynamic foh was a lazy fuck who projected his own laziness onto the front of house staff he was prone to giving lectures about how lazy we all were and constantly threatening us with a stack of resumes he had in the office he would also make insanely creepy remarks about female employees one of whom was my sister so super awesome and racist comments about customers assman was essentially the kind of person who never had any power in her life she then used her new power to make our lives miserable her first order of business was removing any information about workers rights from the premises finally gm was just a manipulative sadistic misogynist who was just straight up abusive to female staff also these three people hated each other and made no attempt to hide it basically by the end of the tourist season i gave no fucks about my job and wanted out i started a work to rule strike which supremely slowed down operations in hopes of getting fired fortunately foh decided to stop scheduling me which led to an intense confrontation where he was very sure that i a fairly physically imposing guy was going to beat the shit out of him instead i told him to fuck himself went home and read the employment standards act in its entirety i wrote a lengthy report to the ministry of labour citing at least violations of the employment standards act for the better part of the next year they were under investigation which resulted in me getting a pay out for termination constructive dismissal and them getting a number of fines the sweetest part being every time i heard from my case worker she spent a good amount of our conversation bitching about how awful the management was to deal with the last i heard from her the ministry was still doing regular inspections of this restaurant since theyve now been red flagged for shitty labour practices so satisfying
this post mightve turned out a bit too close to something from roffmychest but i hope its alright not sure how pro it is either but i think its a bit too much for pettyrevenge so a little background story im currently in my last year in school not quite sure what grade itd be in america but im eighteen right now so late highschool early college the year before this wasnt very productive however and i had very poor attendance and not the best grades however in the last months of the year i pulled myself up from the ground talked to my teachers to see what i needed for a pass and then spend day and night studying and writing to achieve that now my history teacher was rather lax about the whole thing only asking me to hand in one task before summer came and hed give me a pass summer came and went school began anew and we switched systems so that i couldnt see my grades a month into the semester however i was called into a meeting with the viceprincipal where she explained to me that she had arranged for me to take extra history lessons to make up for my failing grade this stunned me and i went straight to my history teacher to ask for an answer he dismissed me at once saying that he never got anything and that i hadnt handed it in despite both emailing it and leaving a printed copy on his desk i offered to give it to him once more but he just said this is just how were going to do it youll have to attend class thatd be the biggest problem the extra classes i got put in scheduled at the same time as four other subjects now i had to run to those teachers ask to do stuff at home beg for them to mark me as present despite me not being so as here in sweden you will lose financial support if you go above absence eventually things have settled down with an extra hours of studying every day to make up for it when sitting in class and hearing about the antiquity for the fifth time however i was not only intensely bored frustrated by the huge waste of time but also angry at my history teacher so when he droned on about how ceasar was stopped just short of achieving dictatorial power i took my first stab actually didnt the senate vote him dictator perpetuo which quite frankly wasnt very far from absolute power mayhaps ill have to check that later anyhow he was assasinated by a group of senators led by brutus who we think was his son isnt that considered highly unlikely by historians today given that ceasar at the time of brutus birth was merely fifteen and on and on id give him four or five sentences interrupt him whenever i could add something which he missed or point out something that was wrong or considered unlikely i knew he was very apprehensive about dealing out any sort of disciplinary action against me and i think i went as close to the line as i could even making him say no i think youre wrong let me look that up real quick and googling something before having to admit that i was right i read ahead in the coursebook but when that proved to be insufficient i started frequenting askhistorians listening to the podcast history of rome and look things up especially common misconceptions before i knew wed cover them in class i think im driving him mad he has apparently consulted my mentor bringing up the subject himself that maybe he shouldnt miss all those classes to be in mine but she knows my situation and assured him that its fine and weve got something worked out he has started to avoid lecturing and started to just hand out an assingment tell us to check the textbook and google for the answers and then disappear all i know is that i will continue this and since im learning ill get a good grade too edit yes i tried to show him the sent email however as i mentioned earlier the school switched providers for their online stuff from a provider called its learning to vklass thus i can not access my previous school email
i originally posted this to rpettyrevenge but soon realized that this revenge wasnt really petty and was assured of that by some redditors so i figured i might xpost it here for those who might be interested andor dont browse rpettyrevenge context so my yearold little brother was born months prematurely and despite the doctors giving him marginal chances of surviving let alone developing normally in the event that he should survive he did and is fully functioning except he lacks in certain areas such as drawing and crafting he draws worse than a yearold in kindergarten but he cant help it so one day the teacher in his art class collects all assignments looks at my brothers work starts laughing and commenting at it and parading it around the class saying this is the kind of crap youre not allowed to bring in and did you use your toes to draw this or something among various other things in front of the whole class my brother naturally didnt want to attend art class anymore and told my mother about this afterwards and mentioned shes been saying mean shit to him for the entire months he had taken her class but not as bad until now revenge after having told my mother about this she was naturally infuriated and went to his school the very next day only to hear the same teacher making rude remarks about other students of hers behind the halfopen class door my mother just stood there for a bit and eventually smiled at the teacher and asked if she could have a word the teacher was mortified blushed harder than maybelline but finally managed to stop stuttering and shaking and came out of the class to meet my mother just a note at this point she had no idea who my mother was or what she wanted she was just shitting bricks because she knew my mother had heard the how she talked to her students so they started talking about my little brother and her remarks and once my mother was done explaining his situation regarding shitty artwork she handed the teacher her business card with a date and time on the back and told her to be sure to show up oh yeah i probably forgot to mention that her title on said business card says head inspector of the censored county department of education the teacher was suspended without pay for days and was made to take some sort of classes on ethics and communication tldr my little brother who was born prematurely was made fun of by his art teacher since he cant draw well due to being born early my mother who happens to be the head inspector of the countys department of education confronted her teacher gets suspended without pay for days and has to take mandatory classes on ethics and communication

i had a relationship with a girl some time ago im and she was we had sex over the summer and her parents freaked out when they found out they threatened to charge me with statutory rape even though my states age of consent is our relationship ended and that was that a few weeks later she and i began talking again i found out they took all of her electronics and had started punishing her severely her school social worker contacted the police when the signs of physical abuse started to surface but the police did nothing to stop it she attempted to move in with her grandparents but it didnt work she eventually burned down their garage to try to get herself removed from the home because she felt that anything was better than living with her parents her parents kicked her out the next day she got home from school and her belongings were on the front lawn and her keys no longer worked i caught wind of this and was furious it was wrong of her to burn their garage to the ground but their beating her and such was too far the day after i find out about all of this im at starbucks with my best friend and my exs parents show up her dad sees me and asks me to talk to him outside im a pretty scrawny dude and hes not so i cautiously agree we go outside and he gets so close i can feel his breathe on my face he starts throwing out words threatening to kill me telling me to watch my back et cetera i told him to calm down several times and not to cause a scene eventually he backed off after this encounter i was fuming this guy was threatening my life was essentially blaming me for his family falling apart because hes a dickhead and acting just like a total neanderthal so i decided to get back at him i called the police and found out what i could do as far as the law and found that i could attempt to charge him with assault among other things but i decided a psychological strike would be much more effective so i contacted dcfs i told them everything about what had just happened with their year old daughter explained the abuse keeping my own incident out of the matter and dcfs went in to investigate they removed the year old daughter from the home as it was deemed unsafe due to the parents violent tendencies they are allowed no contact with her for the time being last i heard their marriage was on the rocks as a result of the stress brought on by loss of their daughter their middle daughter who i had relations with is glad i made the call as it got her little sister out of a dangerous environment i felt that making them lose a child and almost destroying their marriage was sufficient revenge for threatening my life might still get the police involved 
well this is a long story using throwaway account as friends know my reddit name beginning i was born in india when i was i moved to a small country town in australia when my dad got a job here it sucked i was small fat brown had an accent and didnt understand the culture a bunch of racist nutjobs at school bullied me and life sucked thankfully i kept my grades up and got a scholarship to study science at a major univesity in a major city during my first day of tutorials at university i notice there is a shy awkward looking chubby indian girl sitting by herself her name was rani and she too was from a rural town she had just moved up here with her second cousins we quickly bonded over how bad high school was and how nice it was to be in a multicultural city we ended up having a lot of mutual interests and joined the same societiesclubs at our university video games board games indian cultural clubs ballroom dancing etc within a month or so i asked her out first girl i ever asked and she said yes we dated in secret and became each others first everythings kiss love relationship sexual partner etc after a year of secret dating she moved into my apartment life was fantastic we never fought had problems had similar hobbies friends constantly attracted to each other had sex every day etc it was perfect just two love birds building a life together problem well after dating in secret for years we decided to meet each others families my parents are conservative muslims but knew i was going to date around they were just happy i had chosen an indian girl they could relate to her parents initially were very harsh and aggresive however when they met me they immediately fell in love with me the only problem was they wanted us to get married rani and i had already talked about this we both wanted to get into medical school after our bachelors we both wanted a family and the white picket fence but we had both decided to wait on that until after medical school however after meeting her parents and some introspection i decided to speed up the plan my plan was to ask her for marriage in years time when wed finished our bachelors we would get married in the month break after univeristy do a bit of travel have a honey moon and then commence medical school as husband and wife in the meantime i decided i was going to lose all my excess weight and become the attractive groom she deserved both her and i were fat and we never had any issues with our weight and attractiveness to each other and i didnt care if she remained fat for the rest of our lives i just wanted to improve myself and make myself the attractive man she deserves to be with heartbreak rani was innitially supportive of my weight loss she liked the new me and how much energy and confidence i know had after year i had lost kgs and hit my ideal bodyweight i started lifting and was building muscle mass rani started getting more insecure in herself i would reassure her that i had no issues with her weight but we started getting into more fights she was annoyed with how id always cook my meals and i wouldnt eat out with her as much i spent all this time at the gym etc i was too attractive for her etc i would reassure her all the time that this wasnt the case but things kept getting worse with year to go i let ranis father in on the plan i asked him for his consent to marry rani on the proviso that wed get married after graduation so that we wouldnt have to worry about a wedding whilst trying for med school he said yes and was absolutely excited with months to go rani started acting really cold and weird i knew something was up at first i thought it was the stress of med school entrance exams and coursework etc weeks into the coldness i opened up her laptop to look up this tenancy agreement thing regarding our appartment i see a messanger message from this guy that was highly suspicious rani had this friend that looked and acted like that dumb fat brother from my name is earl he was absolutely ridiculously socially inept annoying and very unculturedignorant he was very fat and had bad bo all the time he was in the board gamesvideo gamesanime clubs with us looking over her skype messages rani had been bitching to earlbro about our relationship for the last year or so earlbro had confessed his love for her a couple times which rani had knocked back weeks ago rani and earlbro must have cheated earlbro wanted rani to break up with me but rani was saying this whole thing was a mistake and to shut up well i saw red and immediately packed up my shit i printed the messages out i tell my landlord that i wont be renewing my lease i text rani that i know and that we are through i quickly move most of stuff i dont have much most of our stuff was ranis into my friends house and tell my friends to sheild me from rani well rani found out and went ballistic she apparently ran home and saw my stuff gone she went to our mutual friends house and started balling her eyes out she tried contacting me but my friends deleted all her messages etc apparently earlbro was a drunken mistake she never wanted to hurt me etc the reason she cheated was because she thought i was getting fit so that i could find a better girlfriend and upgrade from her wtf could i please meet her for another chanceclosure blah blah i decided i was never going to talk to her ever again something which i have successfully achieved revenge ranis dad started blowing up my phone a day after dumping rani he aggresively demanded an explanation on why i broke her heart her older brothers also called and made threats etc i didnt reply to their voicemails instead i sent a huge email out to both rani and my parents in the email i wrote out a heartfelt message explaining how id envisioned rani and i getting married but she had cheated i copied in the screenshots of her message and that i apologise for causing a scene and diminishing our families status indians care a lot about family status but that id really like my space so i can concentrate on getting into med school within hour of sending the email out ranis dad phoned up he was very apologetic he said his girl was very sorry and it was a mistake he said he would drive up and beg at my feet to take rani back and offered me money wtf i accepted his apology but said i dont want any further contact with her or her family and wished them all the best a week later ranis family drove down to our city they took rani back to their country town and pulled her out of her courses she didnt graduate on time and couldnt apply for medical school she returned year later to complete her course but she failed she ended up living at home unemployed for a year before going into a retail job she put on massive weight and now looks like a bloody globe word got out to the indian community about her cheating and her family was ostrecised rani is now massively depressed and her family has resented her for bringing down their status in the indian community revenge i went off to med school in another state a bunch of indian parents got in contact with me to tutor their kids one girl i tutored amina blew me away she was studying science and wanted to get into medicine she was gorgeous both inside and out she had a beatiful smile and lit up the room most importantly she had a beautiful sole she was active in her community and volunteered a lot not because it would help her get into med school but because she actually cared after tutoring her for a year i knew i was in love with her i asked her out but she declined she said she liked me too but she is religious and only wants an arranged marriage as per islamic law despite not dating her i knew she was my dream girl so i contacted my parents my parents and her parents arranged our marriage on the proviso that we would be engaged for years until both she and i graduate our respective programs during this time we started dating as fiancees weird i know years back rani and i had made a bucket list of romantic activities we would do together as a couple amina found the list i explained the situation to amina and she said she liked the list and wanted us to complete the activities with some modifications we aimed to complete the list before our marriage amina took photos and scrap booked all our memories as we completed them things like hiking a mountain salsa dancing great barrier reef romeparis etc a couple months before our scheduled wedding amina published our scrap book on facebook somehow rani found access to the scrap book she sent a scathing message to amina saying she stole her idea amina messaged back a viscious message saying how terrible rani is how bad it must be to lose someone like me and that the scrapbook was our idea together before wed get married hearing that i was getting married must have pushed rani over the edge and she threatened to take her life she had to spend weeks at a mental health ward it was a massive scandal in our indian community this was years ago revenge ive been married to amina for years now and things have been perfect she is now in med school and im a junior doctor were trying for a baby now last sunday my father called one of my dads friends from another city was trying to arrange a marriage for his son ranis parents had contacted him with a proposal my dads friend called up my dad to get an idea about rani before they introduced her to his son my dad forwarded my initiialy email to this guy and then called up and told him ranis story of cheating dropping out of university depression etc needless to say that guy ran for the hills and cancelled the arranged marriage he was very thankful for my dads advice and said he would warn the other indian people in his state about her history endnote so thats that in the end i didnt even have to talk to rani these past years to get my revenge all of it was delivered on a silver platter by karma i have a beautful wife a job i enjoy whilst all rani got was misery and selfdestruction all this because i wanted to lose weight before i proposed to her its probably not prorevenge but i still get a kick out of it and maybe some of you guys who are unlucky with love will find some peacejoy reading this just passing the karma on 
gather around its going to be a long post its also getting things off my chest finally okay so this story sets in india my gf at that time was in university and living in a house with around other housemates she was fine with all of them except well call her fb fb was the type of housemate that made sure that my gfs life there was miserable shed do something almost every day to upset my gf sometimes itd be little things like stealing her food borrowing her shit without permission and not returning it etc other times she purposely chipped off parts from her coffee mug that i got her as a gift slashed her bike tyres wouldnt let her and other housemates in at am when they was returning from a party and left them stranded outsideetc you get the picture the house they were living in was for girls only guys were allowed but then asked to leave after am where sometimes random security checks happen i say random because they hadnt had a security check in the years she had lived there fbs boyfriend lived with her for a week with no consequences either so its no surprise that when i came for a week stay over to the house from another country because we were long distance the landlady got a tipoff on the first day and a security check happened where i got kicked out with nowhere to go at am and a kind of remote region my gf decided to sneak me back in to stay the night and leave in the morning for a hotel when i climbed up the staircase to go upstairs to her room she saw me we locked ourselves in the room but then there were cops after mins that showed up because fb claimed that i raped her and touched her wtf i didnt even acknowledge her so the cops interviewed us for an hour and her parents were called they live in a different state explaining what she had done and a big deal was made she had also been told she would be denied a stay for the next semester current semester ending in a month i was let go due to the false accusation everyone at home said it didnt happen but still out in the streets at am sitting on the bench with the nothing to do but plot my revenge so it begins step petty revenges after living with my gf in a hotel room for weeks indian hotels are really cheap on the last day i go back over to her house in the morning boys are allowed at this time and the house is empty since all the girls are in classes fb has her room locked but my gf has the house keys with all the locks so she opens the door to her room the first thing i do is mix sugar and water it really attracts ants and spill a fuck load making a trial from her window to the ground then i move her matress up and strategically place sugar water over all the corners of her matress before i could even move to phase i could already see the ants piling up phase i go over to her private bathroom and there are toothbrushes there my girlfriend isnt sure which one is hers so she calls fbs roommate to confirm roommate hates her too i take the toothbrush outside and douse it with mild pepperspray and leave it out for a while i also take her deodorant spray and put more pepper spray on the nozzle and entrance and let it out for a while phase it had been one of the housemates birthday the previous day so there was leftover cake in the fridge gf just knew that fb will want at least a slice if not the entire thing to herself so i went out to the garden opposite the house and picked up a small chunk of dog poop and put tiny pieces of feces not visible on the cake gf warned the other housemates not to eat it since its a prank and later on she bought another cake for the girl phase i pissed on her soap bar gf took picture phase i put a lot of powder on the rims of the overhead ceiling fan such that when she comes home around and turns the fan on her room would be covered in powder phase i leave the gas on in the kitchen and since shes a smoker the moment she lights a cigarette the house would burn down okay im kidding about this one chill guys but i did almost briefly consider on the night that i was accused for rape step petty revenge in action so the best part of the revenge starts when i take the flight back home and wait for my seeds of destruction i reached my country back at around pm india time my gf tells me that the powder thing just happened so she was pissed and crying about it to the landlady who basically didnt give a shit and asked her to suck it up i send her an international text message i have a data plan to send cheap messages saying you should put powder more often it makes your face look prettier the same night gf sees that she took a slice of the cake i text her saying what you did to me was quite shitty she responded whatever i responded speaking of shitty behavior how was the cake no response gf says she couldnt hear anything in the room all night she caught on to the toothbrush prank so that didnt work out she just texted me nice try asshole im going to use this as proof she took it to the landlady who again didnt give a shit however she used the deodorant and it was so effective that they all had to leave the house for hours enjoying the weather outside lastly after my gf had switched houses the next semester i sent her the picture of me pissing on her soap bar at this point the landlady couldnt do shit so fb took it to the police who also didnt do shit after all that happened why are you so pissed insults ensue step pro revenge okay so if anyone in the world is still reading this all this counts as just petty revenge the real pro revenge comes in here i found out who her boyfriend was since he studied in the same university i made a fake instagram account of a girl and every week id upload a new picture i made it looks completely genuine i had about followers following and around posts spread over months i started messaging the boyfriend talking to him telling him that i found him attractive etc it got to a point where he was like ive actually broken up with her now i call my gf and and confirms with her roommate that theyre very well still together screenshot conversation send to fb send text pity your boyfriend is cheating on you maybe if you werent such a bitch for the coup de grace idk if i said it right when i went over back to india after months her roommate had just about had it with her and was going to move out too she was in charge of the house keys that day and she was in the university so i picked up the keys from her went over to her room again and planted weed under her bed new matress btw then later on at night my girlfriend tipped off the landlady about a guy intruder so there was a security check but instead of a guy the security found the weed they have a drugs policy she blamed it on her roommate who said she was in university all day so theres no way she could do it the roommate also testified to fb using the drugs and bullying her into not telling anyone my gf also testified the same she was kicked the next week lessons in life dont do drugs and dont fuck with the devil the uni she went to was in bangalore idk if i can post the name or if its breaking privacy rules of the subreddit people always smoke pot there it isnt that hard to find weed cops dont care uni doesnt care anyway that is the story of my greatest pro revenge ive had many of revenges but nothing this intense hope you bastards enjoyed it 
i am both proud and ashamed of this one it was a warm summer night and i was leaving my favorite bar with a friend of mine we decided to take a short walk to the top of the parking deck a block away wanting to top off the wonderful night by doing some sightseeing while enjoying our beer buzz on the way there while passing under a window a gravely clumpy damp substance falls all over us getting in our hair and clothes upon smelling the defenestrated sandy stuff that fell on us we quickly realized it was used kitty litter that someone had thrown out of their window and it was putrid you know if the cat lady was crazy enough to throw her kitty butt clumps out of a window this bitch most likely had neglected the shitbox for a while so we had what smelled like half a years worth of kitty piss and shit in our clothes and hair now my ex used to live in the apartments that the kitty litter came from so i knew exactly which window the cat shit sand had been thrown from my friend and i ventured up to the apartment door and knocked on it so we could tell the poopoo perp that this wasnt century london and it is inappropriate to empty your chamber pot into the streets especially if you dont look to see if there are any pedestrians below i knocked and could see under the wide crack under the door that they turned off their light and pretended not to be home originally i was just going to reprimand the cat caca culprit assuming they were either drunk or mentally ill but now this disgusting societal menace was going to just pretend like they werent home what a fucking pussy a revenge plan popped into my head and i pulled down my pants so i could take a piss on their door to let them know how it felt to be waylaid by a wiz but i had a problemall those french fries and pitchers of pbr were brewing something foul in my bowels and i told my friend i couldnt pee because i had a turd brewingwhich is when a brown light build went off in my head while my friend was laughing in wideeyed disbelief i further pulled down my pants and dropped a lurid log the on their door mat and this wasnt just any dingelberry delight this was a postpbr and foamy french fry feces squeezed out of my butt like a softserve station from the th layer of hell luckily the catshit culprit had a swiffer sweeper in their foyer but tonight it was not being used for clean up i took that mop and used it to push my recrimination defecation under their door so when they eventually opened it my surprise secretion would smear into their apartment spreading a brown rancid revenge rainbow on their floor tldr catshit nitwit dumps turds and pee all over me so the putrid poopooperp gets a personal pie reply 
when i was overseas in iraq on my first deployment i decided to take advantage of our limited tuition assistance its free while active duty and doesnt effect our gi bill benefits and take a few general ed classes to get a jump start on my degree i chose a computer class i work in it simple stuff and a health class no big deal i chose the community college in my hometown which we will call mcc because well its my hometown and it made sense before starting the class i confirmed that the school would accept military tuition assistance disregard the fact that i got cs in both classes because the instructors didnt allow me to make up the tests that i missed while in transit back to the us even though they said they would let me that should have been my first clue several years after these few classes i was getting out of the military when i received a bill in the mail from mcc for the two classes i called the education office on base to ask them what had happened and they informed me that they didnt know they had sent a letter to mcc to tell them where to send the bill for the classes i asked if they would send another letter so they said sure and they did a few months later i got a call from mcc saying they still hadnt gotten paid and i had been turned over to collections i asked if they ever got a letter informing them where to send the bill to which they replied that they didnt at this time i still lived in southern california near camp pendleton so i went on base to the education office and asked them for a copy of the letter informing the school where to send the bill my hometown was miles away just close enough for a short vacation so i drove home and walked into the school with the letter and handed it to them at this point the woman in the tuition office informed me with a very unpleasant tone that pretty much reeked of i dont want to deal with you gtmcc tuition lady we dont accept military tuition assistance gtme but i called before i ever even enrolled and asked if you did and somebody in your office here said you did gtmcc no thats wrong we accept the gi bill not active duty tuition assistance gtme how could somebody have gotten those two mixed up this is the veteran tuition office youre supposed to know the difference gtmcc well somebody was wrong but your balance is still for your classes and all the fees gtme why dont you guys accept active duty tuition then gtmcc well a few years ago we did but we never got paid so we stopped accepting it they never paid gtme how long ago are we talking semesters or decades gtmcc well before i worked here ive been here for five years so its been a while that weve had this policy in place gtme cant you guys try billing them this once and see if they will pay up doesnt it make sense to at least try rather than leaving your students to get screwed and stuck with the bill i mean if they dont pay now fine ill handle it but why not just try to send them the bill ive already spoken with the tuition office on pendleton and in pensacola florida where the main office is located and theyve said they will pay they just need to be sent a bill ill even pay for the stamp if youll just mail them a freaking bill gtmcc well if they want us to accept their tuition assistance they need to approach us to work out a deal on payments gtme lady theyre the united states military theyve got hundreds of thousands of veterans around the country whom they are paying for and taking care of they have bigger things to worry about than one community college in a podunk town theyre not going to come to you youre the school who wants the money you go to them at this point i left fuming because now i have a collection agency calling me all the time over two cs that i didnt even want i was already going to school somewhere else and had started over wtf was this mess all about after some thinking i decided to write a letter email whatever to my congressman explaining everything that has happened and how im stuck with the bill i mean the point isnt the money i could pay it but what about all the other vets from my area who want to go to school there what about the people after me who got stuck in the same situation after writing a letter to my congressman i decided to get the people involved i contacted all the local news agencies to see who would do a human interest bit publicly shame these jackasses i found a friend of a friend who has a weekly column in the local newspaper i gave him the full details along with a picture in my dress blues per his request and he said hed help me out yeah you can see where this is going now a few days later i got a call from a representative at our congressmans office i didnt know that stuff actually worked i explained to him in detail all the trips i had to make back and forth going between the school and the education office on camp pendleton delivering papers by hand because the school didnt want to cooperate he said hed make some calls and try to get this resolved a few days later the article ran in the paper it wasnt front page stuff of course our town has enough crime that human interest stuff falls aside but right there was a picture of me in uniform and a few paragraphs about how the school is screwing me over a few hours later the woman from the tuition office calls me back with a very different tone of voice gtmcc lady hi usmcevan i really want to help you out with this lets see what we can do to get this resolved i found out that the representative from the congressmans office had called her the same day the article ran and she was getting leaned on heavily from all her superiors she sent the bill to the proper location and my bill was paid in full very quickly the very next day the school president called a meeting to rewrite their policies on how they handle military students tldr school declined my tuition assistance was crappy to me about it and sent me to collections i got the local media and my congressmans office involved suddenly the school was willing to take the money
growing up in a typical suburban neighborhood i frequently had to interact with the typical neighborhood bullies my bad luck however was that the local bully lived right across the street from me even worse the whole family kid my age his older brother and parents all exhibited the same lack of social niceties and were all equally despised by not only those around us but by seemingly everyone they interacted with they seemed to revel in their bad reputations and it was clear by the lack of parental correction even when an adult called out one of the hellions that there would be no change in their demeanor the father would routinely get into physical altercations with passersby whose dogs stepped foot on his meticulously manicured lawn the mother would threaten law suits for slander against the elementary school teacher when summoned to discuss her childrens behavior the community pastime was discussing the latest atrocity some member of the family had committed now i mentioned the fathers lawn his pride and joy even more so than his children judging by the amount of time he spent in maintaining it my home had a prime view of his treasure as we sat up on top of a small hill looking down and across the street on it summer mornings were frequently started by him firing up some apparatus to coax a little more green out his grass or blow some errant leaves that dared trespass within the confines of his fifty by thirty foot plot of fescue it was annoying but we knew better than to complain someone however decided action was needed to this day i have no idea who the culprit was i often joke it was my mother but she adamantly denies the allegation but whoever our justicespewing vigilante was my hat is off to them it was a slow burn and started innocently enough the father asked my mom if she had noticed any dogs urinating in his yard while they were on vacation of course we hadnt but even if we had she had better sense than to instigate another fight in the neighborhood she assured him shed keep an eye out and keep an eye out we did it soon became clear the pristine grass was taking a turn for the yellow in a couple spots right in the middle of the jerkfamilys lawn within days the plan came into stark clarity a perfectly executed fuck spelled in six foot bright yellow chemicalburnt grass letters the father was irate and his bully sons began interrogating us kids in an effort to calm his ire my honest ignorance served me well and saved me a beating but it piqued my interest in the caper even more i watched with rapt attention through our front bay window as the bullydad dug up the offending vegetation many chuckles were shared in our home while we watched him realize he had replaced a yellow fuck for a dark brown fuck trench he quickly fixed the problem by spreading new seed and laying hay over the whole mess oh but it was a slow burn as i previously mentioned a week or so later we watched as he raked up the hay plastered to the young grass by regular watering and pampering once it was all up and bagged he stepped back to admire his work the once yellow then brown fuck was now a bright green young and healthy fuck he exclaimed so loud enough to hear over our air conditioning bully dad had the whole crew outside in no time all armed with shovels and hoes and eventually dug up and reseeded the whole yard a few weeks passed and all had returned to normalcy that is however until i noticed another small patch of yellow pop up in the middle of the new grass 
i would like to start off by saying that i am not a spiteful person but after reading a post regarding someones revenge on a former boss i was reminded of a former asshat manger that i had a hand in getting fired i am a chemist by trade i work in a lab mixing chemicals together to make viable products for consumers i once worked for a company that made all types of plastic they were in serious need of a chemist and a friend whom is the vp recommended i interview the job was to be the lab manager i would be responsible for other chemists and two qc employees i went through the very long interview process and was offered a job however it was not the job that i interviewed for the management team decided that i was too young i was so they gave to the job to someone else who was older that person would be the asshat manger i was given a chemist job it was a good job and it paid well so whatever so my first day on the job i am introduced to asshat upon meeting him he seemed to relish in the fact that he got the management job over me and immediately started to show it the lab was going through somewhat of a transformation the previous manager was a pack rat as in he kept every single piece of paper that was ever handed to him so my first assigned task was to go through every single piece of paper to see if it was relevant i had to physically remove each piece of paper from the box and scan it over for said relevant info even though the box clearly said on it and all it was was pamphlets from shows or old ass chemical brochures i still had to go through it this took me weeks i was the only person assigned this task everyone else did there normal job in the mean time he was busy showing up for work late leaving early for his two hour lunch disappearing for and hour and a half after lunch and leaving work early he maybe was seen visible working for hour a day fast forward to me finishing my assigned task asshat finally allows me to do some actual chemistry work this is when i found out that he has no real experience working in a chemistry lab or being a chemist how do i know because ass hat decided to mix a couple of chemicals that dont play nicely with each other and then proceeds to throw it in the microwave seconds later we were short one microwave and had a new respect for the fire extinguisher he followed this up with leaving industrial sized mixers on high speed while unattended big no no they could kill someone starting another small fire in the plant and completely ruined an industrial sized mill after a couple months of his unsafe lab practices they continued i started noticing some changes in his personality specifically towards people that he deemed a threat to his authority he got into a very loud verbal argument with our first production manger who then quit then proceeded to get into an almost physical argument with one of our salesmen whom also quit once those two were off his list he turned his attention towards me now for a little back story i mentioned earlier that i was friends with the vp i still am i have worked for him before and i enjoyed it a lot hence the reason i applied for the job i am the type of person that shows up early and leaves late always have always will i take great pride in doing good work well ass hat took our friendship and my work ethic as a threat to his authority and made it his lifes goal to fuck with every single part of my day he would assign me jobs to do i would do them and then he would berate me in front of everyone about how i did it wrong then he would tell me how to do it right and i would fix my mistake and do it exactly how he told me to and he would come back and berate me again in front of everyone about how it was still fucked up he did this for everything the best part about all of this was the end of day meetings these meetings consisted of me going into his office closing the door and him yelling and swearing at me for at least mins topics you ask think of one it was probably my fault in some way this went on months until i cracked i cracked because he got physical as in shoved me when my back was turned now i am not a small person i am athletically built i played football i ran track and i lifted weights i dont know what got into him but it got into him in a big way i was shocked i had never had a boss do that before i dont know why but i just let it happen so when he was done screaming in my face i just left and went straight to the bar and had a drink and another and another that was the day i decided that i had had enough i wasnt putting up with anymore bullshit i am admittedly not a very creative person when it comes to revenge so the only type of revenge on a boss that i had ever seen way before reddit was from the movie office space i literally did what that guy did i just showed up and did absolutely nothing i came and went when i wanted i took minute smoke breaks hour lunches came late and left early this drove ass hat insane and every time he tried to talk to me about it i did exactly what the guy on the movie did i just never stopped and walked right past him every time he wanted another meeting i just never showed up i just went home instead so after a week or two of this i happen to be wandering around the office and i stumble into my vp friend he seemed stressed out and i inquired as to why the safety inspector is here and he will be doing a walk through of the plant he said he told me to let everyone in the lab know that he was here and not to fuck up his words not mine well because i had literally quit doing what i suppose to do and ass hat had to do what i was suppose to do and seeing that he is a walking fucking disaster i took off for my hour lunch i wander back into the plant after my hour lunch my food was excellent and shit has hit the fan every big wig in the company is in there and they are all freaking out i walk up and the first thing the vp asked me was what did you see being friends with him i replied i didnt see shit what happened so word on the street is this ass hat decided that he owned the place that day and went out and used one of the industrial stand up mixers think kitchen aid mixer that makes cookies but feet tall to mix something in a gallon container i was suppose to be working on this project but obviously wasnt now these things are made for containers that hold gallon containers so he puts this container under this gigantic mixer and realizes that the container cant be strapped down with heavy duty chains side note you need to strap down the containers these things spin at rpm i have seen gallon containers spin that weight lbs thats some scary shit so what does ass hat do he grabs a roll of duct tape and tapes that shit on of course once he plasters that bitch with duct tape he cranks that mfer up to full blast and walks away also a big no no for those of you that dont know all machines in any industrial shop have to manned at all times no exceptions about minutes into this act of stupidity in walks the safety inspector one of the production guys sees this gigantic fine running and promptly runs over and shuts the machine down right as the safety inspector sees it over walks the inspector to inquire into what the hell is going on right as ass hat walks out of the lab freaking out asking who shut off his mixer and of course cussing and swearing he then proceeds to turn the mixer back on cuss out the production worker and asks the safety inspector what the fuck are you looking at and walks away so once i am got done laughing my ass off i calmly inform my vp and all the other big wigs that i am not surprised i inform them of their lost microwave the fires the destroyed mill they knew about the mill they just didnt know how it happened i told them about the confrontation that occurred in his office and i told them the truth about some other things they didnt know about bottle of scotch in his desk drunk on the job etc etc the fire in my vp friends eyes was burning hot enough to destroy worlds at this point and he turns around and tells everyone that there will be a meeting regarding todays events in the morning and orders everyone people to go home we show up the next day and ass hat was no where to be found the point of the meeting was to inform everyone that ass hat was not allowed within ft of the building and that if we saw him near the building we needed to call the police what i found out later was that the police already had him when my vp friend went to fire him ass hat got physical and the security guards with my vp friend got physical back he was charged with a whole slew of shit to much to remember later that day i was promoted to lab manager and given a raise we celebrated with a glass of scotch that found in ass hats desk 
im a college student and like all other college student im poor i dont get to do a lot of nice things however sometimes i will treat myself im a huge fan of bubble tea one day my friend and i went to a bubble tea cafe near our campus to celebrate the end of midterms this particular cafe is a favorite of mine because i know the manager were on a firstname basis and shell occasionally give me a free drink just because i was hoping to see her again but a different woman was there sherry i went up to the register and placed my order asking for less ice sherrys eyes bugged out and said we dont do that here i was surprised because all bubble tea cafes do that i repeated my request asking her if she could do if for me anyway even if it wasnt an option on the machine she cut me off and said no i was speechless this cafe generally had great customer service i paid and them my friend ordered sherry worked at a snails pace instead of making multiple drinks at a time she made each drink individually i watched her make my drink and to my surprise she added extra ice to my drink after minutes our orders were finally finished and my friend and i left we headed back to campus it wasnt until we were in the dorms that i tasted my drink to my surprise my drink was incredibly diluted and the bubbles were overcooked this bubble tea was a waste of my money i was so angry that i made a yelp account and posted a long detailed review about why my bubble tea was terrible by chance my friend took me back to that cafe i saw my favorite manager and she told me that sherry had been fired because of my yelp review along with other customers complaints i asked the manager if they had a job opening and they did i started the week after working what used to be sherrys shift one my first shift i noticed that you can input the customers ice preference tldr woman makes terrible bubble tea i write a bad yelp review she gets fired i get her job 
now for this revenge youre gonna need some backstory senior year of high school i moved to a new school didnt know anyone except i met this one girl who were gonna call r now r was at first seemingly a nice but strange girl she admitted she liked me and as i was rebounding from my previous relationship we hit it off after about month of us being together i caught her cheating on me i decided that she wasnt worth it and broke things off and decided to completely shut her out my life started getting better i started making new friends and things were looking up thats when the rumors started they were small things but either way i knew she was behind it i ignored them and went on with my life a week later i hear from some people that her and her new boyfriend were caught having sex off the side of the road in the back of his car i laughed and made jokes but i again refused to make any comments and left it alone she confronted me in the halls in front of the principal and accused me of starting and spreading rumors about her i told her she wasnt worth the effort and i walked away apparently the principal didnt like the excessive profanity she used against me and forced her to formally apologize to him now for the story i came back to school after spring break to be whisked into the principals office shortly after sitting down a police officer comes in with papers i was being served a restraining order against me for allegations of rape her affidavit was along the lines of my ex boyfriend throwawayforjustice raped me last november he has been spreading rumors about me and i highly suspect that he is the one behind the notes in my locker telling me to kill myself mortified i was sent home and unable to return to school for about a week during that week i compile all the evidence i could against her the fact that we stayed together for months after the allegations and the fact that she spoke of me in such a loving tone not the tone of a rape victim after the week was up i walked into court prepared for the worst the judge a stoic man in his early s presided over the case and after all was said and done i had brought boxes full of evidence both copies for her and for the judge while she simply read her affidavit the judge dropped the order and i was a free man once again now for the revenge i left the courthouse and when the court recording was released and i was given a copy i immediately approached the detective leading the case against me for rape he dropped the case and instead took up a case of perjury and falsifying a police report shes going to be spending a few years behind bars for what she did her new boyfriend left her strangely enough it was when she was being arrested he left her not when she admitted to him she made it up and shes being disowned by her family she fucked up and revenge couldnt be sweeter tldr girl cheats on me i ignore her she lies and says i raped her in court i get her thrown in jail

my former wife loves to take expensive vacations we live in ohio which doesnt exactly have extravagant places to see unless you like to watch grass growing or interstate construction while we make ok money im convinced she felt the need to single handedly improve the us economy by taking elaborate vacations broadway shows in new york city gambling in las vegas spas in arizona sightseeing in san francisco the airlines know me so well they ask about my dog when i call to make reservations his name is fred in my attempt to try and save whatever i could so the princess could have her nice things i bought this honeywell wifi enabled device so i could adjust the hvac while we were away piling up massive amounts of debt on mickey mouse watches i thought we could save a few bucks by keeping the temp cool in the winter and warm in the summer the device was easy to install i did not have the blue connector so i had to repurpose the green one this required an adjustment to the actual hvac unit in our home there are plenty of videos on youtube to demonstrate how to do this within an hour i was up and running the device works flawlessly you can adjust the temp from anywhere you have a wifi or cellular signal little did i know that my ex had found someone that had a bit more money than i did and decided to make other travel plans those plans included her no longer being my wife and finding a new travel partner carl a banker she took the house the dog and a good chunk of my k but didnt mess with the wireless access point or the wifi enabled honeywell thermostat since this past ohio winter has been so cold ive been messing with the temp while the new love birds are sleeping doesnt everyone want to wake up at am to a degree house when they are away on their weekend getaways i crank the heat up to degrees and back down to before they arrive home i can only imagine what their electricity bills might be it makes me smile i know this wont last forever but i cant help but smile every time i log in and see that it still works i also cant wait for warmer weather when i can crank the heat up to degrees while the love birds are sleeping after all who doesnt want to wake up to an degree home in the middle of june here is the original link 
i joined the navy when i was ended up as a corpsman in iraq and afghanistan and when i returned found out that i was going to have to take classes to even become an emt fuck that right so i did the next best thing i got a degree in economics now i see you there grinning ear to ear what an idiot right well it turned out pretty well for me i picked up a job for kyr as a business consultant for a smallish company in the area now ill use a pseudonym for my bosss name here hed be jeff so im fresh with a ba in econstudying with sandy pants aint fun with a pretty decent job jeff and i seem to get along the only problem is that hesa product on the s everything was about cutting corners and cutting costs as much as possible to stay stable in bad times but this was around and my take on it was that itd lead to businesses continuing to drop out they cut costs which cuts demand in the area which further kills businesses so we have to expand our areas further and further just to break even and you know im okay with this because where hed offer his expertise in business id offer mine from an economics standpoint and much of the time my ideas ended up with better results well jeff doesnt like this too much he cut his teeth in business when i was still in diapers right so he keeps moving me off projects and onto smaller ones where the commission isnt as great and the businesses are already knee deep in cost cutting so its almost impossible to turn it around as people keep leaving the area because theyve been foreclosed on but that isnt what got me oh no were talking about a six figure contract now and he taps me to work on it because we recently lost a senior analyst this is my chance right so i work with this business for months straight and slowly what started as a quarterly loss turned to then breaking even before finally turning a profit itd be a nice tidy bonus for me bzzt wrong after the latest quarterly report pegged their growth at around they started slipping back again why you ask because my boss went over my head and started offering his own consultation theyd make much more money he reasoned if they just cut back on workers brought on some temps at half the pay of their staff or eased off of maintenance of their machinery so they started doing that and they started falling behind my boss then blamed this on me and my delusions of grandeur and my naivete i figured out that he had been reviewing my work then replacing my suggestions and analysis with his own they fired under his consultation half of their work force who knew what they were doing by then and replaced them with temps whodidnt know what they were doing the resultant waste numbers blossomed higher than theyve ever been and they were mad they wanted blood and my phone was ringing off the hook as they blamed me for their companys negative turnaround so i quit but i was so damned mad madder than i was when a marine would shake me up at because he had guard duty at and the fucking french shared their wine with him i wasnt doing anything with my money between extra from gi bill post money bonuses and my wonderful paycheck i already had a stable home and enough money saved up that i didnt have to work for about years but thats not revenge is it it started small i worked out of my apartment calling up the small businesses that i had successfully consulted for over the couple years freed them from the oppressive grasp of my former boss who had started filling their heads with fear mongering about wasted profit business turned into then jeffs company was starting to flounder because while the larger businesses paid much more because of their size and complexity the bulk of his profit came from the smaller quicker jobs with tinier independent companies with this new profit i put a down on a small property down the road from jeffs office one of the many businesses that shut down during the recession partly due to his corrupting influence i needed more people so i hired a recent econ grad to help me out i bide my time snatching up small contracts and working on pulling the larger ones lots of driving coldcalls and actively showing up i finally returned to the company that had trouble before the one jeff threw me under the bus for and lo and behold who do i find but jeff himself the owner of this company was having a rather heated argument with jeff about the state of his business and jeff being who he was was talking his way out of it so i roll up portfolio in hand filled with the successful reports from the small businesses i already took from jeff and as soon as he sees me his eyes go wide as dinner plates in front of god and everyone i start my pitch i push this portfolio onto the owner and explain in cold calculating detail how i managed to keep these businesses running the gears are turning in the owners head and jeff looks apoplectic before i add before jeff decided he knew better than i did i was doing this for your business too all hell breaks loose jeff just wails on me you ungrateful little shit and after all i did for you nobody else would hire a college puke with no business experience the owner had him escorted off the property and i offered my services to his company for free until he realized that i knew what i was doing a few months later i had a neat little six figure contract of my own my very first one and i brought two more people on payroll jeff wasnt too happy though oh no he started sending me harassing emails thinly veiledor not at all threats so i responded the best way i could i sent him a bouquet of flowers with my card and on the back of it sorry to hear about your business troubles if you need a business consultation youre welcome to give me a call it is now and his business has shuttered im currently working from home due to a accident that broke my armbroke it in three places it is not fun but my second in command a woman who also served in iraq and now with an econ degree of her own called me on monday we picked up another six figure contract and well need new people she had someone in mind for the position best resume in the pile a guy by the name of jeff with years of business consultation experience i told her to toss the resume and go for someone a little fresher feels good man so fucking good 
my family has had a run of bad luck this year we had a saying last year itll be better in well early in the winter we were greeted with a call of did you know the marina is on fire no we did not know that my mother was in denial wed gotten this call a few times because the fire trucks fill up by the marina sometimes and she figured it was just that i didnt want to counter that the ice was over ten inches thick at least i just hoped it was a small fire it was not all that was left of the building was a tiny metal frame on one end for a bit it seemed like we could twist this fire into a good thing that building was crap and wed never have been able to afford to bulldoze it it happened in winter when we never make any money anyway if there was a time for a fire to happen winter was a good time the insurance called it a total loss so anything we salvaged didnt count against us for payout but we were able to salvage things a brief rumour started that it was arson started by usi might do a post on who started that rumor and why it died so quicklybut it was going good then the lawsuit came in wed had problems with these people before but a lawsuit felt a bit over the level of the nastiness they were capable of they were suing us for harassment over the other issues destruction of family heirlooms it was a tree a baby tree trespassing on property legally declared as ours and other propertyrelated stuff we countersued on the notridiculous stuff so an important thing to know about this area is that the property lines are fucked when my family got the marina we were sorting out the property lines with four different entities the parcels were in bizarre places one was in the middle of the building surrounded by another parcel the reason for this is because were on the edge of two counties who both tried to determine the property lines and they did so by markers that dont exist anymore or are now underwater as the lake levels rise every year markers literally in the original property lines are the old oak tree we did find that one its a stump they were the only people who refused to settle we had to call in surveyors our surveyor gave us ft of land they didnt like that so they called in a surveyor their surveyor gave us another ft oh yes we enjoyed that but on their lawsuit they tried to go back to the original agreement before any of the surveyors they had less than a stable case we took photos of the property line from the water and lined it up with old photos we got a new survey done after we heard theyd tried to trick the system by giving a surveyor the property line and getting him to sign off of it we used the same company they did the surveyor gave us even more property they arent pleasant people to deal with we had kept this really quiet taken the high road however they shot themselves in the foot as expected they put up orange plastic fence around their supposed property line which their lawyer told them to take down and my uncle did rip down in front of them but it was too late one of the gossips of the lake asked us what was going on and we were kinda dont spread this around but knowing hed spread it around he did the whole lake knew that these people were suing us the people who just had a catastrophic fire take our livelihoods oh did it get nasty we had people pouring in sneaking gossip to help our case they had a history of doing this we were told to get a look at this legal document and that people with motorcycles offered to drive by multiple times at inconvenient hours which we explicitly condemned while looking pleased with the idea because these people were just being so stupid i was expecting them to be stubborn through arbitration and shoot themselves in the foot during the court case and thus according to state law pay all our legal fees they did actually give in at arbitration we got the property they brought in three lawyers from a nearby large city we had one local lawyer they then fenced in their tiny hardlost property with their lawyer watching the whole time someone dropped by to let us know their fence wasnt up to county codes if we report it they would have to rebuild it weve been a little busy but i think summer in the middle of their busy season is the best time to do that anyway edit some things we arent entirely sure what prompted the neighbors to sue us but the biggest reason we think is that they knew we were struggling financially and that we just got a whole bunch of money plopped into our lap after the fire after all they werent asking for just land but money from us too the fire was probably caused by mice nesting in some electrical wires we know what wall it started on and there were some freezers on that wall that kicked on and off all the time only thing flammable on that wall i have pictures of the remains of the building and those freezers are just gone everything in that entire area was obliterated we are pretty wellliked around the lake and the fact that they decided to sue us after the fire was not gone unnoticed so it getting out as i pointed out several times would send the neighborhood friendly mob out if we could get spread the word in a way that did not trace back so clearly to us like explicitly asking the source not to spread it around they would not have sued us without the fire and the fire made the neighborhoods reaction more extreme 
i posted this to pettyrevenge some time ago and just happen to stumble across this sub and thought i would just share my story for your enjoyment so here goes i live in a pretty large gated community and my house is currently going under some renovations as with any renovations you get junk that needs to be thrown out so my parents decided to get one of those big containers that can be taken off and put onto the back of a truck its lifted onto the truck with a big mechanical type hook thing thats attached to the truck to throw the trash out edit its called a skip we got the container pretty late into the evening after the construction people had left and therefore it was empty for the night the next morning however we woke up to the container being full of random crap and a big ass queen sized bed that looked about yours old so of course my parents were pissed beyond belief that someone would just dump their trash into our container after we paid for it and now we dont even get to use the whole thing now on to the revenge part of the story as i was looking into the container staring in disbelief when i saw something sticking out of one of the trash bags lo and behold it was a letter with the perpetrators address what do we do well that night me my brother and my father decided to return to these people all the trash that they so graciously left in our container but since they were inconsiderate enough to dump it in our container we decided to dump it all over their driveway and in front of their cars so they could not be able to leave without cleaning up revenge is sweet and the neighbors did not even come and thank us for returning their stuff how rude tldr neighbors dumped their trash in our skip gave it back to them all over their driveway 
im back guys another one from the car world in my many years of being in this business ive met very few natural sales people i am not one of them i got to where i am by discipline thick skin and drive to succeed im not a mind reader and i stumble over myself from time to time however every once in awhile i run across a gifted sales person and surprisingly they are some of the most difficult and often times unprofitable sales people they know they are good and therefore they think they have free reign well as many of you know i work a group of dealers and over the years weve acquired various dealers well i remember we acquired a new dealership it was a chevy dealership and i remember in my first meeting with the store manager we went over our staff we where reviewing our sales staff and one guy stood out to mejohn who always seemed to be selling cars a monthimpressed with his numbers i mentioned this to the store manager who sighned i asked whats wrong he went on to explain john is good and john knows he is good and therefore he runs lose with the rules and causes the mgt a headache however the old owner put up with it cause he represented such a large portion of the dealers business i however do not believe your performance gives you a free pass sure if your a rockstar and make a mistake im not going fire you over it but that doesnt mean you can do whatever the fuck you want i said thats fine ill watch john and his habits but first ill have a sit down with john and explain what is expected of him so later that day i sat down with john a pleasant enough guy of course he would be and i asked him about his behavior he of course denied that he was a reckless individual just a top performer thats fine so i personally went over with our employee conduct code now for those of you dont know i have an employee conduct code it basically is a set of guidelinesrulesand what we expect out of you it includes things such as no relationships with customers no using dealership property for direct personal benefit treat all customers and employees with respect no duis no drugs on the premise leave home at home be honest both to your dealership and especially to your customers etc i then explain to him that him that i expect my employees to first follow the code of conduct then worry about business john of course agrees and signs all is good maybe he wont be a problem not even days later i was taking a breather outside the office in the doorway and john was to the left of me but couldnt see me as there was a large pillar blocking his view when i heard a customer approach john the customer explained that he was here for another sales person he had an appt and was ready to buyi then witnessed john blatantly lie to the customers and explain that particular sales person wasnt available and that he was instructed to take care of the customer completely not true i walked away and found the sales person and i told him that john was currently selling his customer but not to worry cause id transfer the deal to that sales person and hed get all the commission and do none of the work john of course sold the customer proud of his accomplishment i approached john and advised that i witnessed him skate another sales person and reminded him that was against dealership policy he brushed it off and said dont matter i made bank to which i then advised him that he was getting for his work and the sales person who had the appt will be receiving of the deal and this is to serve as a punishment for him john was furious it was a nice check about i reminded john im the new king of the hill and i play differently and he needs to adjust we go home for the day with no further incident a few days later im driving over to the dealership when i see one of our cars without dealer plates sitting in a red lobster parking lot this is completely against company policy one a show car is to not be driven off our lot without dealer plates and show cars are not to be used for personal gain i of course turn into the red lobster walk into the restaurant to see which one of my sales people are using dealership property for personal gainsure enough its john sitting there enjoying his meal i approach him sit down and the look on his face was priceless i advise him he is using company property for personal gain and that is against our code of conduct i then advise him he is suspended from work without pay for the up coming day weekend i also advise him i will have the car towed back to the dealership and he can figure out how hes going get homehe protests says i cant reasonably expect him to walk home in this heat it was the summer and that he is very sorrynope not having it i leave him be have the car towed back to the dealership his suspension was enforced and he didnt work that holiday weekend it cost him a bundle too he also got to enjoy the long walk back to the dealership in the summer heat come that tuesday i sat down with him and explained to him that he is on his nd strike and another incident and hes out of here he didnt seem to take my threat seriously i advised him that even though he sells cars a month i can easily hire people to do his work and the dealership will still live on a week goes by without incident and then on a monday morning i get a call from the store manager saying we need to have a talk about john so i drive over to the dealership and sit down with the store manager he says i need to go visit johnso i do john looks like complete crap he has a black eye a bruised face and walks with a limp concerned i asked what happened he says he made got into a shuffle with a family member over a personal argument feel bad for the guy but he wont get into any detail i advise him to do his best to look his best and let me know if he needs to go home early i leave and im by the front desk when i see a very angry man who just a few weeks ago bought a car from us enter our dealership lets call him jason he asks to speak to a manager i quickly get involved this isnt normal this guy is steaming and something is seriously wrong im deeply concerned that maybe a safety issue caused an accident or something like that all i know is something is seriously wrong i pull the guy into the back office he is fuming he is angry and he is pissed i clam him down advise him im here to help him through his issue and that i would love to help him he then finally explains what happened a few weeks prior his wife and his worked with john name keeps popping up again and bought a car i wonder did john lie or whats up he continues on and explains that last night he came home from a hr shift to find john in his bed with his wife lets call her cindyhe is fumming angry is upset that we would hire such a person and then i inquire is this the reason why john looks like he got the crap beat out of him he admits that he did beat up john and he feels that we should know what john is up to i thank him for his time advise him i will handle this swiftly i explain to him not only will i deal with the sales person in question i gave him some extras on his car for free actually quite a bit i also advised him that this behavior is unacceptable i pull johns phone log all of our sales people are provided with cell phones for work those phones automatically upload their call log to our system sure enough their is quite a bit of textingcalling going on between john and cindy starting after the sale of the car and into the eveningthis is not normal your car sales professional shouldnt

i had been hoping this story would make one more turn in my favor which would have ended in a higher level of rprorevenge but last night my revenge embers cooled im going to try to make this as short as possible but i really suck at making things short winded and there is a lot that happened and now that ive typed it all out short it is not the background in august of i left my job as a dispatcher to pursue a new position as a buyer for a major food packaging company in their production department dispatching was second to my job of purchasing however the dispatching aspect left me working hour days and being on call of the time the new company promised itd be an easy hour work week with occasional ot here and there unfortunately for me i did not get this in writing and took the position as a salaried employee i tried to negotiate a month review with potential for a raise but was declined oh well the hours would be less and i was cutting my commute in half the first month everything went well i worked with some really cool people and i was proving i could handle the workload with ease the turn toward nopesville well right around the month mark the woman that did purchasing for their maintenance department put in her week notice this was no surprise because everybody knew she was going to school to become an rn what was a surprise is that i was now expected to learn and perform her job as well i already had a pretty good grasp on the first position and figured taking on the second position would be a good challenge and further prove myself as a valuable employee with maybe an extra hours work per day i asked again for a month review which they agreed to again i didnt get in writing but it wouldnt matter in the end through this companys massive financial success they never bothered to upgrade their purchasing system for maintenance purposes there was no inventory system nor any way to generate a proper purchase order po in the system so i had to manually type out everything onto an excel spreadsheet then generate a generic po in the system then i had to track all purchases on a separate document it was a very cumbersome system that led to me working hour days again there was no way to track a specific item to any vendor without searching through hundreds of filespos and hope someone wrote a decent description at this point i was relying solely on the memory of the mechanics most of which had only been there for lt months needing to do constant stock checks and asking the mechanics to teach me about some of the processing equipment so i could have some idea of what i was buying i was not always at my desk despite having a radio on my side at all times the plant manager complained that i was never in my office and i needed to notify him via email or radio every time i walked away with a reason this included going to the bathroom this isnt elementary school and me not being at my desk does not put someones life at risk i begrudgingly comply but this is the first major strike in my mind the rest i chocked up to a loss due to my incompetence not getting things in writing still i wanted to turn this around and see if i could make this work i learned the system we used was actually quite versatile and with a few hours of initial setup i could build an inventory for the maintenance side in the system and generate clear and trackable pos since i was salary i could come in on a weekend and knock it out halfway through my proposal to the plant manager he cut me off and told me he didnt want to do it i tried to explain how this would help the company monetarily and timewise not to mention the sad sack that got the position after me having to deal with the same bs but he flat out said no strike two were now at the end of november and into the early part of december the company is rebranding their pasta sauce line and introducing some new recipes i had to source several new ingredients and order huge quantities for their first run which would begin in january of it was tough but i was making progress while also barely keeping my head above water in the maintenance department then i am given the news that the woman in charge of purchasing all packing materials is taking a week vacation for christmas my requested time off for my birthday the week before christmas is being denied because i need to cover her position as well why the purchasing manager has not been trained on how to make a purchase order so now purchasing anything for the entire plant rested on my shoulders this is now strike three and i begin posting my resume and applying for jobs again i was going to continue working until i found something anything else to get me away from this place by this point i had already discussed quitting with my girlfriend and my savings would keep me from putting her in any economic harm for at least months with current spending when i got to work the day before my birthday i opened my email to find emails from the overnight crew throwing me under the bus for not ordering a certain part before i could get through all of them the plant manager was in my office explaining that i was underperforming and this couldnt happen again at risk of being fired i showed him the emails that proved the mechanics lied about when they tried to order the part me following up with the vendor to get a status and the fact that the mechanic only gave me half of the information the vendor needed i again explained my plan that would drastically reduce these issues if i had any sort of way to view past purchases and i would have known exactly what was needed his response was just deal with it strike four numb nuts i neatly stacked everything i was working on depending on their status forwarded a few emails to back up my side to my personal email and sent an email to the plant manager hr and the production manager explaining that i was leaving the company and where everything was that i was working on i included my address to send my final checks to it was always wrong on my paychecks which i had several emails asking them to correct but they handed them out on payday so it wasnt a huge issue i collected my things and walked out the door passed all of their offices which were all empty had they been there i would have stopped to explain the revenge a few days later in what was the normal payday i received my typical automatic deposit it was only for the last full period i worked and did not include the few days i worked into the next period or my accrued vacation time i had also not received the check stub which arrived nearly a week later with the incorrect address it was delivered to the address on the envelope and then finally made its way to me after being returned to the mail carrier before i sent another email asking them to correct the address i decided to look up state laws on payment upon termination of employment oh was it eye candy in my state if someone quits they must receive all owed payment within hours for every day late after that they are to pay the person as if they were still employed if they pay on day they are to add additional days pay also any previous agreement of automatic deposit is voided upon the termination of employment unless there is a written agreement at that time there was also a list of state fines associated with each infraction i composed my email to hr and explained the laws they were violating as well as requesting they update my address and if they would mail me my final check within two days i would not pursue any legal action hoping they would reply with reason this would all be settled by the middle of the week which was dec and also two days before the next scheduled payday their response the next day stated that i would receive my automatic deposit on friday since i had agreed to that upon my initial employment this time i replied with direct links to the states website and laws they were violating and stating how simple this would be in court all i wanted was what i was due and not asking for anything extra there was no response until the next day the deadline i gave them when fedex knocked at my door with an envelope containing my check stub not an active check there were no deposits into my account until that friday when the normal payday was scheduled at this point im actually impressed with their carelessness and oversight in messing with someone who literally has all day to himself now is time to make a real request for everything i can legally ask for this email again explained all of the laws they have violated and requested the full amount due i even calculated the amount they owed me for the late payment days minus the hours rounded down to the nearest because im a generous person i had kept every email professional because i know that if this does go to court i cannot look like a complete ass i already had walking out on a job going against me again hoping theyd side with reason i detailed how much extra can be awarded to me up to x the late payment amount plus a total of the state fines their reply this time was simply no the court documents were downloaded and filled out the following monday but i was going to give them one last chance another email again detailing the laws and the corresponding sections of their employee handbook citing these laws and how ignorance of the law is no defense but explicit knowledge and failure to follow them would not be in their favor to add a little additional spice i copied the ceo on this email i concluded the email requesting resolution by the end of the week or court documents would be filed an hour later i received a response from hr that their lawyer would contact me by the end of the week by that friday i had a check for the late payment plus a second check for double the amount if i agreed to not take them to court which i did agree to back to what i alluded to in the beginning since this was now reported income for the year i would need a w from the company in order to file my taxes on the day i received those checks i set a reminder to pursue whatever course i could if they failed to do so my dreams were dashed when my girlfriend sent me a picture of the envelope last night i even made sure to verify every cent just in case in the end im happy it didnt resort to that i now have a great jobcareer path and i do not want to waste anymore time on an old employer tldr op gets new job op leaves new job op executes win all the money op wins all the money edit missed words and poor spelling edit tldr as scribed by uxponcex because my tldr would need a tldr of its own
i first posted this in rpettyrevenge but it was taken down for not being petty enough i thought you guys might like this story of cheaters justice ill go ahead and be specific because honestly i dont give a fuck if she sees this post or not i was on vacation last winter and met a girl at the beach we hit it off she was very attractive at least she lived by the coast and i lived in central nc about a three hour drive away we begin meeting up regularly going on trips that i always paid for we even went to nyc and when i brought up her paying her share of the hotel costs she said she would pay me back on the next trip on that particular trip she brought a friend of hers and that friends fianc and they all seemed pretty distant with me like none of them gave a fuck and they were just three friends there having fun while i paid half the bill i know i know i was a dumbass i thought we had a pretty good relationship going after about six months though she starts flaking out when i want to hang out not returning texts for hours one word answers when she does return them after a while i decided she just didnt want to see me any more and we stopped talking she starting posting pics of her and another guy on facebook referring to him as darling oh well i thought just another girl hell bent on wasting my time and money a few months later she contacts me though apologizing for how she treated me and how bad she feels about what happened to our relationship she wanted to meet up again and go on another trip with her friends this time to atlanta she wanted to see a braves game go to the aquarium etc anyway i told her that i forgave her and i would love to go with her and her friends i had other plans in mind she asked about the tickets to the brave game and i told her that if she wanted to go she could just order the tickets online and i could pay her for my ticket later she said that was fine we agreed to meet up in charlotte and they could just park their car there and ride with me to atlanta they never offered to help me with gas money long story short the last snap message i got from her before i blocked her number and blocked her on all social media was a pic of the charlotte skyline that read almost there i read the message from home while drinking a wine cooler and watching a movie the thought of her and her friends driving aimlessly around uptown charlotte looking for me still brings a smile to my face to this day 
 long time lurker first time poster for years my parents used to tell me not to worry about bullies because some day theyd be working for my interests i grew up being bullied all through grade school by a majority of my peers at a small religious school within the lower i never had any beef with anyone not even petey the main school bully petey was smaller than i but walked around like he was tough shit when his boys were around he liked to agitate me into responding and when i did his posse would come from nowhere to beat the living crap out of me teachers rarely intervened in fights and when they did i was in trouble most of the time because youre the bigger person you should know better never figured out how it was my fault that kids decided to kick me black and blue but i was the only one who got a paddling for it at the end of my last year at this school they had this yearend party complete with water balloon fight at the end as everyone was drying off after it was over i heard someone yell petey nooooooo i turned around to see him running at me with his arm cocked back and throwing it forward towards my back the balloon he held was thrown with a force that knocked my face into the dirt i came to with him kicking me as people were dragging him off me soon after that i was taken out and put into another school where i excelled beyond expectation some many years later i was summonsed for jury duty i was one of the lucky cunts out of hundreds picked for such a prestigious honor theyd tell us before hand the names of the people who would be on trial so we could be excused if we knew them guess whos name appears old petey and what for the areas largest narcotics bust in or so years i didnt know this fool anymore i dont want to say i helped put this sad sack of shit away but i will say ill never forget the look on his face when he entered that courtroom in chains and saw me sitting in the front row hell be eligible for parole when my kids have grandkids 
i was told this belongs here 
many years ago around midnight on the eve of my st birthday i sat in stunned silence as my exgirlfriend told me that she had been raped a couple weeks prior at a party as she told the story including the part where her friend was banging on the locked door and screaming trying to get someone to stop it i felt helpless angry and confused all at the same time in a way i never had before it was truly my introduction to adulthood in a way though she had gone to the hospital had the rape kit done and filed a report charges were never pressed the guys fraternity brothers had cornered her afterwards and said that if she tried to go to the police they would all testify that she was lying and use their connections to prevent the case from proceeding one was the son of a state senator the da declined to pursue the case mostly because she was too scared to cooperate but also because his family hired a lawyer to proactively stonewall the process needless to say she was a wreck two days later i visited my colleges counseling center i had found myself so enraged i was actually planning the rapists murder in my head and i had even talked to a friend about helping me who then suggested i see a counselor in the months that followed i gradually came to terms with everything and how my anger resulted from things i had witnessed as a volunteer firefighterparamedic it was considered a form of ptsd but from an emotional standpoint it was this stunning realization that life by design isnt as fair as i had been brought up to believe fast forward six years i really hadnt kept in touch with my exgirlfriend very well one day i got a friend invitation on myspace this was years ago from her and i gladly accepted through the messaging feature we caught up and exchanged phone numbers i learned that she was doing well and she only had a few months more of her residency before she would become a doctor she had also married and was expecting her first of four children a few weeks went by and one night she called me she told me that she had searched for me and reconnected because she had some news seems the rapist had recently been convicted of another rape and she wanted to be there for his sentencing she asked me to go with her as her husband was out of the country her mom couldnt go because of her health and she wanted someone there for support and she felt it may give both of us a sense of closure i went with her but we didnt know there was going to be a hearing first i wont go into the details but all i can say is that it was really hard to stomach after both sides had people read statements they broke for a brief recess the recess was a lot shorter than i pictured it we came back in and the judge said something about ensuring there is sufficient time to take advantage of the opportunity to rebuild his character then gave him years which i thought was really odd being so wide and all here comes the revenge after his lawyer spent what seemed forever arguing that he should be released pending appeal denied they adjourned and the spectators from each side avoided eye contact and did sort of an awkward exit my ex being very pregnant at the time had to stop at the rest room on the way out as im standing there some guy standing near me said bummer huh for some mysterious reason i got this weird feeling i should pretend to be on his side and just nod he asked how i knew the defendant and i said i went to college with him when i was asked if i was in his frat i lied and said i was we had a brief conversation and the guy spilled to me that it was likely they were going to send him to a prison that happened to be in the city i lived not sure how he would have known that but like i said the kids parents were well connected when my ex came out the guy congratulated us on the baby and before she could correct him i said thank you hey we gotta hit the road ready babe she gave me a weird look and said sure lets go babe as we got to the car i explained what had happened and thanked her for playing along she knew i was up to something and asked why i was excited that he may be at the prison near me and i said oh itll just make me smile when i drive by knowing that hes getting at least a taste of what he deserved but i had something way worse planned you see i was friends with the cos and on a first name basis with the superintendentwarden when i got home i rang up one of the cos and asked if hed meet me for a few drinks a couple nights later we sat down and had a few beers and i filled him in i made sure to tell him about the threats his frat brothers had made and insinuated that his family had connections with many prominent democrats i also told him the guy was jewish now i may have been stretching the truth a bit but i knew this co pretty well and there was one thing i always hated about him he was an antisemite and he hated democrats because he thought the party was run by sneaky jews truth be told i have no idea who this rapist and his parents were connected to and i was pretty sure he wasnt jewish even though his name suggested as much the co said that hed look into it and if it was true hed be there hed make sure he was given the royal treatment a little over a year goes by and i totally forget about everything one night im at the bar of our local vfw and i run into the co who is having drinks with some of his other co brethren they were absolutely shitfaced he slaps me on the back and says ah thanks for the yuks i didnt know what he meant and he says your slur for jewish people pal the one that raped your girl oh boy you have no idea how much fun weve had with him basically when he got there they put him in segregation right away single bed but not the solitary confinement kind they told him it was for his protection and he thought his parents pulled some strings the real reason they did it is because thats usually the procedure for informants i dont even want to know how they got the chief officer to approve it when he was brought back to general population they started telling everyone that he was jewish which apparently is a bad thing if you want to integrate yourself with the white guys in addition to being hated by the other inmates and on one occasion roughed up a bit in yard time they started banging him for even the most minor infractions as a result he started getting testy during his constant hearings which resulted in lengthier punishments his life was a living hell the cos also got some of the bigger inmates to intimidate him during shower time and they would pretend to walk away for a few minutes to let him get to know his fellow inmate better they would never actually let him get raped though if he were to report a rape the responsible co would get in deep shit just to see him sweat i guess that in one short year the guy had pretty much been through hell and the night that they were drinking with me he had been sent to the infirmary for a psychological episode of some sorts earlier that day he had learned from another inmate that all of the infractions on his file made it near impossible for him to get paroled in his first hearing regardless of how well he did in the years to follow he didnt take it well i know what i did was objectively wrong but it just feels so right when i drove by the prison i would smile and wave recently though i learned he had been transferred at some point i dont know where but i hope hes getting the royal treatment there too 
so this all happened around a year ago i was a senior in highschool and my friend and i were looking for some spare cash to be made naturally so we went window shopping for jobs at our local mall after browsing for any store that was possibly hiring we walk past a pillow kiosk the kiosk donned a now hiring sign so my friend and i applied luckily for us the owner was there and hired us on the spot red flag he took our names addresses and emails no social security i will get to that later breakdown of the job stand at the pillow stand approach people and ask them to buy overpriced pillows if we sold x amount of product then we would be able to make commission before i press on i need to say my father has always given me this golden advice always have evidence of your hours to which i have taken photos of my punch times for every job i have had right moving on our bosses were two israeli gentlemen who said we would be paid every wednesday they were personal checks again a red flag i worked there for two weeks without a hitch making commission for nearly every day i worked there third week rolls around and the mall wasnt as busy as it was normally possibly attributed to nice weather and i had no chance of making commission for that day oh well i think its no big deal i think i was wrong sort of as it turned out to be a hassle for me financially crippling for them the day after my missed commission day i get a call while on my lunch hour at school fdbs its me bossman i see you did not sell much pillow yesterday and this is being unacceptable i will not be paying you for this week but mr bossman that is illegal you have to pay me for this week i cannot pay you for this week you not sell many pillow yesterday oh man oh man here it comes as an angsty high school senior i couldnt wait for this i knew what was coming as i had documented my hours and everything i show up at the pillow stand after school to confront him and he once again says that he cannot pay but this time he said i cannot prove my hours see he says as he pulls up the now blank punch card oh thats unfortunate but see as i pull up my phone with all the pictures on it he gets really hesitant and visibly distraught as i have said i cannot pay said mr bossman do you want me to call the irs i said ah you do not need to call them why you threaten me i will pay you only because you do threaten me and i feel like untrue things will be said to the irs said mr bossman to sum up the next part of the story my friend and i quit that day we got paid in full days early again personal check and oh thats right i called the irs to report tax evasion as the bosses never took taxes out of our checks never took our social we got audited and had to pay roughly in back taxes however they were no longer at the mall the following week they had mentioned having a yearly contract that was up in december this was may tldr sketchy pillow salesman hires my friend and i tries to not pay me pays me and loses his business and gets in trouble with the irs for tax evasion

all this happened back in the late searly s i was a cocky lil sysadmin contracted out to a large dutch tv production company whose excrement sorry products are sold produced and braodcasted worldwide i was stationed at their main facility a large studio and office complex where the majority of their dutch language tvshows were recorded and to be honest it was actually great fun to run into tv personalities all day every day most of them were really quite nice in particular to the pfy who was trying to fix their macbooks of course every now and then youd run into someone who was a bit arrogant but id usually manage to get them to drop their attitude by just talking to them like a normal human being dealing with celebs is all in a days work under such circumstances and besided youd usually deal with them indirectly through their production teams i seldom had to deal with the production teams anyway as i primarily dealt with macbased workstations and servers which never had gave me any real troubles sometimes the odd macintish performa would pop a psu capacitor or id have to zap the pram on a mail server piece of cake but supporting macs wasnt why i had been contracted out to begin with i was a windows ntguy and the company had decided they were going to switch to windows now to phase out servers and workstations at once was a bit more expensive than the executives were willing to accept so a compromise had been agreed upon until the last of the recently acquired imacs reached endoflife theyd use citrix to load a windows terminal server desktop on each of the nonwindows clients seemed like a good idea i guess i was contracted to manage the transition from macos to windows as it turned out there were some troubles with the chosen combination of applecitrixwindows terminal server troubles which ended up causing serious troubles on the entire network the citrixclient crapping itself the moment someone pressed a wrong button st gen imacs were notorious for this printers not working properly and connections dropping due to ethernet broadcast storms there were days where the entire company ground down to a screaching halt needless to say the employees were less then impressed with all this but i managed to keep their spirits up with my comforting voice when they called the itdept information department this is sebbonl how may i be of service so it was a wednesday morning in september and all hell was breaking loose somebody pressed key a instead of b or maybe citrix had just crapped itself once more maybe the moon had risen in virgo with saggitarius ascending or maybe the gods were just in a particularly foul mood that day whatever the reason mightve been the entire network had crapped itself and my coworkers were in the middle of rebooting the entire network servers routers switches everything in the meanwhile i was manning the phonelines and explaining the situation to our irate userbase people were upset of course but i calmed them down took their names and numbers and promised id be in touch the moment their department could resume working i also spoke to a girl from a particular production team telling her the outage was global and id be in touch the moment we had a resolution her boss cunt from here wasnt having any of it so he decided hed call us himself the conversation went something like this me information department this is sebbonl how may i help you cunt are you a fucking retard me excuse me cunt i asked you a simple question are you a fucking retard are you aware that my entire team is currently unable to work me ehm well we are aware of the problems they seem to be global however all production teams as well as hrm and financials are unable to work right now were dowing the best we can actually but it may take about half an hour for the network te become available again cunt that is unacceptable you son of a whore all of you it assholes are incompetent bastards who should be taken out and shot in the back of the neck now i am familiar with vulgarities and insults but i had never been spoken to in such a manner by a coworker of sorts so i begun losing my cool somewhat me sir please refrain from using insults were all in this together and this isnt helping if you cunt interrupting me what what are you trying to tell me what to do you little fuck ill fuck your whore mother clueless imbecile at this point i really felt like returning the favour and lay into him however being an external contractor i felt this wouldve constituted a clear cla career limiting action so instead i responded by saying sir i am no longer willing to continue this conversation in this manner please give me your telephone number and ill get my manager to call you the cunt proceeded to give me his telephone number an number in the nl this indicates a mobile phone still a relatively new thing at the time but i still had to have a name me thank you so who can i tell her she should

this happened back in but it was such an awesome revenge that i still giggle when i think about it we used to live in a culdesac a street with a dead end with very little traffic despite this one guy decided that he was adamantly against anyone parking their car on the side of the road because he felt that it cheapened the look of the street and was going to lower his property values yeah one of those guys this guy decided that he was going to call a current affair about it they are a really shitty australian tv show put in quote marks because theyre so bad that tends to focus on fad diets dodgy businesses bad neighbours and things like that here is a link that explains exactly what its they stopped my mum as she was leaving to go to work and asked if they could interview her she agreed but said she wanted to ring our next door neighbour harold the bad neighbour lived on the other side of him and harold hated him harold worked locally and quickly drove over so he could be interviewed as well the revenge harold was a news anchor for many many years and knew how to control the media knew what to say to turn them against bad neighbour on camera with bad neighbour smugly standing there watching he started destroying this guy claimed that many of the other residents in the street were afraid to leave the house in case this guy came and berated them i cant remember exactly what else was said but i do remember that part mum said that she could see the aca peoples eyebrows rising as harold went on the next night we watched the show to see what would happen not only did they have footage of the bad neighbour marching down the street set to the imperial march from star wars but theyd put in all these interviews which they must have gotten afterwards from people at the local council saying how this guy had been harassing them for months and then footage of the guy doing stuff like cutting back someone elses plants because they were hanging over the footpath just barely and therefore a violation and an interview with him where he said hed had to ring several other councils because the local one had stopped taking his calls as well as the police in short they revealed him to be exactly the crackpot he was instead of doing what hed hoped portraying him as some kind of crusader of justice fighting against the evil neighbours bad neighbour ended up complaining to media watch about the whole thing which meant that the episode got aired again and finally moved away because everyone was laughing at him so much tldr shitty neighbour tries to use the media to get his way exjournalist neighbour manages to turn them against him name changed
repost from tifu it got removed but i decided to post it here instead since it actually makes me feel better talking about it to people throwaway because i dont want this haunting me like most tifus this didnt happen today it happened back in middle school in the late s it was th grade i was a scrawny little nerd i wasnt exactly a social person i mostly held to myself playing pokmon in te back corner of the cafteria and since this was a small town in texas i was definitely the weird kid in class and because of this i got bullied a lot most of the glass was apart of the bullying but there was one kid in particular that did most of it ill call the kid james because thats his name james used to push me into lockers call me names and make the whole class laugh at me he was a textbook bully most people would probably maybe tell a teacher parents or maybe they would try to fight back i didnt even think of that though all i could think of was sweet sweet revenge now this couldnt just be your everyday put gum in the hair revenge no this had to be reeeaall prorevenge i decided to make his familys already bad financial situation worse by making him get addicted to smoking it would be hard i couldnt just go and shove a cigarette into his mouth and hope not to be beaten no i had to infiltrate his life and ruin it from within over the next few months i was slowly starting to be nice to him i helped him with his homework shared jokes with him i even gave him some of my precious pokmon cards by th grade i had become his best friend had i not had my mind clouded with hate id see that james was mean because of a lot of things he was insecure his home life awful and above all he had been jealous of me i however did not see this i had infiltrated his life and it was now time to destroy it over a few months i started smoking i thought that it was worth it since you had to make some sacrifices for revenge and then i offered james some he was reluctant at first but after some persuasion he caved in and tried it much like a drug dealer i gave james his first couple of packs for free but after he had become addicted i told him that hed have to get his own james did everything as planned at first he smoked packs a month then it became a pack a week until finally he smoked a pack a day james was addicted for real now my plan had worked flawlesly james stole money constantly from his father and he even had to get a job to pay for his addiction james grew anxious and angry every second he didnt light it up i had gotten my revenge but was i happy we were now in grade and i had finally realized what a great person james really was i knew what i had done was horrible so i tried to stop him from his addiction i flushed down his cigarettes i hid them i even took away his money so he couldnt buy his death sticks this was all in vain however since he in grade started smoking packs a day during the next years me and james grew closer and closer i was the best man on his wedding and he was at mine hell i even witnessed his sons get born i still couldnt forgiven myself how cruel i was when we were kids and i constantly tried to get him to quit the cigarettes think of your kids i said do you want to witness them graduate marry and have your grandchildren this worked james went down from atleast packs a day to pack a week again it was very hard for him but he made it james was after years completely cigarette free james me and his wife were ecstatic about this i was so proud of him however this happiness didnt last very long james was diagnosed with stage adenocarcinoma lung cancer the cancer got worse and he died months after the diagnosis its now exactly years after his death and his family is still suffering from the consequences i try to help them as much as possible but since i had to quit my job due to depression its not a lot i can do financial wise i constantly think about my mistakes how james would be alive right now if it wasnt for me how his sons wouldnt have to grow up without their dad how his wife wouldnt cry herself to sleep every night james was so much better than me and just because he was mean to me as a kid i had to fucking kill him i constantly think about killing myself but i cant his family needs me the family that was robbed from their dad because of me if i killed myself it would make things even worse so to close things up tldr i killed my best friend because of a petty revenge
so i work on trees and sometimes i have to do blocks and blocks of trees near the street when this happens i put up all the correct signage which is usually a men in trees sign and a few lane closed ahead sign my crew works pretty fast and safe well everyday when we would take lunch we would be sitting under a tree eating our lunch its much faster and efficient for us to just leave the work zone up while we are eating well one day this asshat decided it would be funny to start running over our cones in the taper thats the row of cones that starts from the curb and goes at an angle to try to force people into one lane this started on a monday and everyday asshat would come by and run over our cones and laugh at us while we are all sitting down taking lunch so one of us would have to walk a few blocks to go retrieve the cones it basically fucked our lunch and work zone up well come wednesday i had enough i went to my local hardware store and bought a few pound bags of quickcrete and some great stuff spray foam i took two of the cones home filled the top two inches of the cones with the foam and went and had a beer while it dried then proceeded to mix up the quickcrete into the cones i let it sit overnight the next morning i realized that i mixed it too wet and it would have to dry another day i was kinda upset thinking that i would miss my revenge sure enough asshat came again so friday i take the cones to work and set up the work zone first two cones are normal then the two concrete filled cones lunch time asshat drives by and the whole crew is watching he notices and gets going extra fast knowing that he has our attention first two cones then first concrete cone dents his bumper pretty goodgoes under the tire then gets stuck in the wheel well but soon falls out about the time he goes over the second cone hits his car smashes up the bumper and he drives over it he speeds off pretty quick most likely thinking wtf just happened he was in such a hurry he didnt notice his oil pan got ripped off enjoy your hopefully locked up engine edit ok first off this was on a low volume street if it wasnt low volume we would have closed the street down completely and detoured people around its much safer for us yeah i could have gotten shit canned for having the cones like that yeah someone could have gotten hurt but i was much younger and was pissed usually we leave a giant chuck of wood in the work zone to discourage that anymore that being said fuck that guy i used to try to leave nice workzones for traffic now we just close it off days before and detour everyone around and tow any car parked on the street for everyone that called bullshit well whatever but i am a very active poster in two tree related subs so you can at least know that
mandatory this happened several years ago so im not a fan of bathrooms here in the states there is like a foot of clearance between the stall and the floor and an inch on the sides of the door i worked at a target at one point in my life i used to work pretty early in the morning so on my first break id usually drink a huge can of monster energy drink i didnt like the urinals at my work they were like right next to eachother with no divider so i usually used the stalls to pee well this little brat decided to crawl under my stall kid was like so there is no excuse he crawled under there and turned up to look at me with his mouth wide open i fucked up and panicked without thinking about it i started peeing on him he sat there for a good minute and a half it seemed then got up and ran out of the bathroom i slipped out behind him while he was talking to his mom outside the bathroom about what happened when she finally did understand what the kid was saying and why he was sogging wet you could tell she was on the war path and went into the mens bathroom on the hunt for the suspected perp needless to say i non challantly as possible walked away and spent most the rest of the day hiding in the meat cooler serves him right for crawling under my stall
my wife recently started a job at the checkin desk at a downtown star hotel one of her shift supervisors is a relatively young lebenese guy lets call him douche nozle dn dn is a typical jersey shore looking wannabe hes got greasy hair immaculately groomed day growth and tanned skin the funny thing is he is also pudgy and overweight so the whole look just comes across as sad ive met him a few times and he is smarmy arrogant and treats his staff like shit anyway from day he started hitting on my wife he initially sent her a text explaining that he lifted her number from the hr file as he was a dedicated leader and wanted to look after his team he texted her pretty much before and after every shift asking her to lunch before hand or drinks afterwards in order to explain the sytem to her these texts later devolved to telling her to sleep well and lots so you can be fully refreshed at work explaining that he wanted her looking angelic like you always do anyway there is tons of this random crap and he is always calling her pet names like babe angel or sexy my wife tried to keep it professional in her replies but it was quite clear this dn wasnt going to stop she also always wears both her engagement ring and wedding band so there is no excuse to put this story into context i am a current serving army officer as a platoon commander who has led soldiers in afghanistan i would say that i know a thing or two about leadership so hes claim that he was just being a dedeciated leader just seemed pathetic i wanted to straight out punch this dude in the face schoolyard style but my wife calmed me down as she didnt want to start trouble at her new job and as a supervisor dn could technically assign her the crappy shifts two weeks ago my wife asked me to go pick her up from work that way she could introduce me to dn and rest of the desk clerks as her husband i went straight after my work so i was in full uniform and arrived about mins before her shift ended i walked straight up to him and introduced myself to dn i towered a foot above him and gave him my hardest bone cruncher handshake my voice was friendly but my eyes were like a hawk gday dn my wife told me all about you she is saying how you are a great leader and always looks after her team he reddened mumbled something about being busy and walked way i stared at him all the way as he exited the room my wife and the rest of her team all burst out laughing pathetic a few days after this incident my wife gets an email from dn with upper management ccd dn works with her everyday so the only reason why he would send her an email in lieu of just telling her would be because he wanted her to get into trouble from the bosses the email explained that employees are forbidden from having personal visits during work hours as it might reflect badly on the hotel if she was to have someone pick her up that i should wait in the loading area at the back of the hotel what the fuck i was super pissed now again the wife calmed me down and told me to forget it i love her but she can be annoyingly professional sometimes so i sat down and plotted revenge with my of my army mates during our weekly drinking session we decided that the revenge should be subtle and not traceable to me this rules out physically harming him we then came up with a series of events that would screw with him a period of days mind you i did this all while keeping my wife out of it she would not approve my mates and i went to a internet cafe and spent three hours signing up his work email address to all number of strange websites from all corners of the internet from gay dating to armadillo appreciation anything and everything somethings we say i will never be able to erase from my memory the raw internet is a horrible place children we surveilled him from when left work and tailed him to his house it wasnt hard as we had his shifts courtesy of my wife after acquiring his address we waited till dead in the middle of the night sneaked into yard jacked his car up and placed all four tyres up a tree he had in his front yard let him puzzle that one out finally my friends and i called hotel management independently six times at varying intervals pretended we were guests and complained that we saw dn behind the counter looking at inappropriate stuff on the internet i feigned disinterest when my wife came home excitingly telling me that dn was late for work as someone had removed his tyres and that management had come to ask him a few questions but seized his computer instead when he wasnt there and were going through his emails a few days later dn had being demoted and moved to a different location across town star motel owned by the same corporation ive never told my wife my involvement tldr fuck with an army officers wife get demoted and moved across town edit corrected for grammar and spelling 
this is a story that happened on my drive home about half an hour ago the smell of justice still hangs in the air im driving down this quiet onelane residential street playground zone but its pm so im doing over the speed limit of kms all of a sudden some putz comes flying down the road behind me stopping mere inches from my bumper i mean i couldnt even see his headlights anymore and i drive a smallish car i just wanted to get home not into an accident so i moved over into the parking lane theres not two lanes there but at this time of night there was nobody else on the road and i was driving in the gravel at the side of the road this guy had more than ample room to pass me if he wanted gtnopejpg this paragon of driving etiquette follows me over still so close that i cant see his headlights well shit what now i keep rolling along and see my salvation in the distance the saddest most useless piece of curbing ive ever laid eyes on actual i keep driving along towards this thing drawing ever nearer my palms are getting sweaty my eyes are darting back and forth from the iwanttobearealcurb and my rearview mirror i have a very small window all my training my years of experience have led me to this moment i either go home a hero or not at all i wait till the last possible second and swerve back into the lane proper doucher mcgee back there just didnt have the time to react what followed was possibly the most satisfying series of sounds ill ever hear i watched in my mirror as his front end hit the curb at his bumper was immediately ripped off dont lower your rides kids his car jumped up onto the curb and devoured the unsuspecting sign as a dolphin would swallow a fish a final glance back as i turned the corner a few hundred meters ahead rewarded me with the glorious sight of smoke pouring out from under his hood 
this story is a from almost years back but i just found this subreddit and thought it would be a good story with video also note this story uses kph because this is in colombia it was sept and i was driving my nissan in a quiet residential area i approached an intersection that was rather notorious for people disregarding the stop sign i have the right of way as streets going either north or south usually do i was going kph and i look right as im about to cross the intersection and i see a big mercedes suv hauling ass just meters away from the intersection easily kph i see a cellphone by her ear she sees my car and brakes to around kph crash my car even hit the sidewalk with enough force to lift the entire right side away from the ground i am shocked and a little bruised and literally crying seconds after the crash i love my car she drives away seconds later as a first but small victory for me a cab driver that saw the crash can be seen on the far right edge after the crash turns around and chases her and brings her back my family and some friends arrive to help me uncles are lawyers while the cop and the respective insurance lawyers sort everything out this lady driving the mercedes and her husband threaten us youre going to be screwed out of insurance watch your bank accounts etc the traffic cop was bribed by them we saw her husband giving him money and drew the accidents sketch incorrectly my uncles notsokindly proceed to point out this error sketch is corrected and they didnt like that we noticed second victory cop asks both parties to sign off the report i dont sign it youll know why we leave my car was towed as it was undriveable and her car was never even present at the scene of the accident after the accident itself fast forward two days later a friend suggests you know the building in front of where you crashed has to have surveillance footage bingo third victory we go ask get the video and take it to her insurance and our insurance company now the reason i didnt sign the accident report was because in her statement she claimed i was speeding going the wrong way and that i attacked her car lying to the insurance company is grounds for cancellation on top of that my dad found out both the cars they had the mercedes and a bmw are leased my dad is friends with the owner of the lease company he handed over everything a week later we get the call that they took both cars back cause they were used fourth victory a month after the accident i get my car back as good as new the cost of repair was greater than the value of the car biggest victory but it was fixed because my dad is also friends with the owner of nissan in colombia he told the insurance company friends as well dont let this car get totalled he loves this car and that is how i got my great revenge on the person who i hate most in this life the video if anyone wants to watch it is here accident at ps we also investigated them got their address names kids names where they go to school what they do for a living everything long story short they have stolen a lot of money from the state thanks to shady businesses they run edit the reason i refused to let my car go was because at the time it was a year old nissan sentra with miles kilometers i inherited the car from my grandfather and i love it to death

just to start off i suck at telling stories and i just want to tell this story while its fresh in my mind when my dad was still in the military he was in charge of a group of soldiers one of them was a female who he said probably had mental issues he has no idea how she even got in but she did this female soldier befriended another soldier because of her issues she trusted him without question very quickly eventually she trusted him to drive her car and get some money out of the atm for her this little shit took her car completely emptied her account and then went awol now this girl was about to leave the army due to her issues and that money was all she had to help her once she was out so she was devastated they eventually found the guy and he was brought before my dad since my dad was his superior officer now im not entirely sure why but they wouldnt just straight up arrest him and send him to fill sandbags in the texas heat at the bases jail my dad said something about the legal process takes awhile for a chapter or something like that in other words the civilian police couldnt arrest him since he was under military jurisdiction and the military couldnt do anything because it was being investigated or processed so anyway my dad couldnt find a way to send him to the jail and this guy is all cocky like i dont regret it one bit shes just stupid for letting me have access not my fault shes stupid etc etc my dad was looking for any way to punish this guy until he found out the most borderline illegal thing he could he ended up going to the guy still sitting there with this smirk on his face and my dad said well since you dont show any remorse and i cant send you to fill up sandbags here what youre gonna do i got a job for you your job is to sit in this tiny room and make sure the paint doesnt peel no one could talk to him he would leave to eat he ate in an isolated room facing the corner and to go the bathroom that was it also my dad was only required to give him hours of sleep so he could leave the room at midnight and at in the morning he was woken up to make sure that paint didnt peel my dad even decided to have some fun with him one day he went in and said i feel like being nice today im gonna let you read todays paper the guy was overjoyed at the prospect of getting to read the newspaper all he had done was stare at a wall and didnt even know what was going on in the outside world right as he started to read my dad took it away immediately and said actually never mind youre stupid cant believe you trusted me then left again after a few days the guy couldnt take it he called his attorney and begged for him to find a way to send him to the bases jail so he could fill sandbags instead of staring at a wall making sure the paint doesnt peel but attorney couldnt find a way to make it happen eventually they were able to discharge him from the army my dads nd in command had to escort him to the front gate to officially release him what the jackass didnt know was the civilian police were finally able to get a warrant for his arrest for stealing that poor girls money so the whole drive this cocky guy is like yup soon ill be out and i can tell you how i feel about you yadda yadda and the nd in command is like yup you can say whateeeeeeeeeever you want when they got to the gate they released him and the nd in command is like well youre out of the army now you can say whatever you want the jackass opens his mouth to speak but the nd in command goes wait just one more thing gentleman this is the man and the two civilian cops who had been waiting out front immediately put him in cuffs my dads nd in command leaned in to the guys face and said have a nice fuckin day then laughed his ass off tldr soldier steals another soldiers life savings my dad makes him sit in a room making sure the paint doesnt peel until he can be discharged and arrested by civilian police like i said i really suck at telling stories and remembering details i dont even remember what i had for breakfast yesterday if you need anything clarified leave it in the comments and ill go ask my dad i think that would be better than making him retell the entire story to me while i type
my wife works for a national chain of home improvement stores and brings her lunch with her to work daily including bottled water to drink while she eats when she gets to work she stashes all the consumables in the refrigerator in the break room we live down south usa and last july was extremely hot im talking over degrees f for days in a row my wifes water bottles were just disappearing between the time she got to work and meal time obviously someone other then my wife love you sweetheart thought they were too good to drink from the water fountain i can only assume it was someone working the unairconditioned garden center that was extremely thirsty and couldnt resist the cold water after the second day i recommended a revenge plan which my wife shot down due to it possibly putting her job in jeopardy after the third day she agreed i looked up a video on youtube on how to open water bottles without breaking the seal for those who are interested anyway the plan was to refill the water bottles with vinegar i filled water bottles with vinegar and left alone i put a little mark on the water bottle so she would know which one was still good to drink she went to work and set the trap when she came back into the break room for lunch one of the vinegar bottles was gone from the refrigerator on the other side of the room there was a liquid all over the floor like someone had walked into the break room all hot and sweaty saw the magical chilled beverages that always appeared and chugged and spewed vinegar while we never did find out who was stealing the water it hasnt happened since and just imagining what i just described above has been very satisfying for me hahahha edit thanks for all the replies some users are calling it fake or posted in the wrong sub not fake i found this sub yesterday and decided to post a time i got revenge figured id share my idea of a good laugh 
im from london and take buses and trains nearly everywhere i had some driving lessons when i turned but i never passed my heart wasnt in it so while i can drive i am not a licensed driver this particular bus im on heading west is headed for heathrow and is a very long single decker theres a point on the route where a brick wall flanks a very tight curve the bus needs to edge through there and nearly everyone knows the spot is tricky and give some space to the many bus routes that come through here this airport shuttle is so long it need to be extra careful and i always commend the drivers who make it look effortless about or miles later ive alighted at my stop and am a few steps away when i hear commotion a woman has pulled up on the drivers side of the bus at a degree angle to block the bus i drew remember we drive on the left here he needs to pull out to the right total grade a dick move she is screaming at the driver that he cut her up back at the dodgy walled corner shes demanding his driver id and plate which she could take herself because its there for anyone to see the driver didnt cut her up she likely just didnt have patience and got pissed while he took the corner hes rightfully refusing to give her the time of day and quite politely insists she stop blocking the bus theres about people on board with places to go some passengers are telling her shes being outrageous as well i have ceased walking and remain because im not afraid of pushy selfish people she didnt even shut her driver side door or take her keys with her so i get in and drive ahead a bit its now parked at the end of the bus stop so its not blocking the bus nor any traffic i get out and see the bus driver shout cheers mate and he all but flattens her as he swiftly takes off to continue his route now that she cant berate him she tries to get in my face but im much taller than her anyway and put headphones on and continue walking better still my walk takes me onto a road which you cant enter by car from her way its one way slip onto her road so she couldnt follow me even if she had the balls she wants everyone to think shes got if she was clever shed have taken his plate herself but she missed her chance and will now never be able to report her grievance to the bus company tldr a madwoman blocked a bus that i just alighted from so that she could shout at the driver but let her door open and engine running so i moved it for her and the bus and my fellow passengers could get on their way edited a word edit whoa i went to bed and this got popular and for science of the dodgy walled section
a fun story for you all when i was young highschool age i lived with my family in a middleupper class suburb everybody in the community got along and for the most part life there was quiet peaceful and enjoyable that is of course for one major exception of the house next to mine which was rented by mr public nuisance pn be it drugalcohol fueled parties drug busts and constant eviction notices there was rarely more than a week that went by without some sort of police involvement to put pn into perspective he would have failed to get a job being a dirtbag simply because he was overqualified one fateful night however the neighborhood got even it was about pm on a spring night myself and family are attempting to sleep however the party bumping from the other side of the fence is making sleep or even clear thought all but impossible police had already been called volumes had been turned down then turned back up again as soon as the police car had pulled around the corner i crawled out of bed and made my way out to the living room the front door was open and my father was standing out front in conference with the neighborhood pajama committee they dispersed and my father came back inside i asked him what was happening gtjust be quiet and follow me i followed my father out of the house into the back yard where he opened up the valves for our hoses they bulged under the pressure he handed me one of the nozzles and whispered on my command we both walked over to the fence and took aim my father waited checking his watch until finally his arm dropped streams of water appeared from all around and jettisoned into pns yard sounds of drunken partying turned to screams of shock now would probably be a good time to note that the neighborhood water supply was winter runoff which usually sat just above freezing temperatures in the cool spring air it was probably quite uncomfortable screams of shock were eventually overpowered by a yell of rage pn had lost it and was screaming half slurred expletives we shut the water off and somebody yelled back sorry thought it was the dog a few minutes later the neighborhood pajama committee had recommuned and were giggling among each other pn was standing in the nude in front of his house continuing a to yell at the top of his lungs at that moment a police car pulled around the corner long story short pn was taken to jail on charges of providing alcohol to minors indecent exposure lewd acts with a girl under the age of and a slew of other alcoholdrug charges he plead guilty to many of the charges and evaded jailtime however because he now had a record of sexual assault he was forced to move away from our community and the many schools that were nearby

this is a tale ive told plenty of people before but never had the chance to share it on reddit when i was in middle school there was a guy named joshua who was a real prick he and his two cronies would go around in stereotypical fashion and pick on anyone who was dorky different looking poor et cetera unfortunately as a white nerd in flushing ny with a single mother i fit all the requirements now lunch money wasnt really that big most people were either on an official lunch plan or brown bagged it on the daily i was the latter and so joshua proceeded to steal my lunch from me day after day after day of course being a little bitch a freshfaced youth i went and told the teachers but i was always met with answers like just sit somewhere else really he comes to me lady tell him its not his lunch gee what a novel concept or my personal favorite his friends said that you gave your food to him now at this particular middle school witeout was banned apparently because some kids had been found sniffing it behind the bleachers were talking about year olds in this school people it was this that gave me my perfect idea the next day i had graham crackers in my lunch before the period started i brought my lunch into the bathroom along with a halffull bottle of witeout id swiped from my mothers desk i took the little brush and liberally applied the odorous chemical to the graham crackers id like to pause for a moment and say that i imagined in my idealist yearold mind that he would see the graham crackers slathered with white and reeking of witeout and say darn i cant eat this my master plan foiled or something of the sort needless to say little joshua stole my lunch again that day i chuckled to myself thinking of how hed curse my name when he discovered the best part of the lunch had been made inedible later that day i was called into the assistant principals office apparently little joshua had left class with a stomachache and was currently en route to the hospital getting his stomach pumped long story short i got five days inschool suspension joshua missed school for a week and he never went after my lunch again oh and the best part he thought it was icing
i worked as a security guard downtown in a large canadian city this story starts when i got a phone call from one of the other guards working he found a contractor had parked and left a truck in a loading dock bay and was inquiring if i knew anything about it the site i worked at had buildings over floors between them and that shared a loading dock with only spaces occasionally on an expected slower day contractors could ask us to leave a vehicle there if they were doing a quick job but it was infrequent as the the loading dock was really busy around this time there was a company who had just rented or floors and there was a massive remodel going on there people were in and out constantly and the job was going to run for a few months this made the loading dock bays busy enough that we werent letting anyone park there just unload i had been there that day and no one had asked permission to park and nothing had been passed on from other guards or property management i told the guard as much and he went to find the contractor to have the vehicle moved about half an hour later as i am patrolling i hear my guard arguing with someone near the building control center as i approached i picked up this was an argument about the truck the contractor was saying that they had been given permission to park there i walked up and explained that there were only people on site that day that could have given permission i was one of them and worked with the other for half the day and we didnt give anyone permission to park there he needed to move the vehicle the contractor left at that point and i thought the issue was settled about minutes later i was covering a break in the control room when the foreman of the contract company who is also the owner of the truck approached and told me that they had been promised parking and arent going to move the truck i again politely explained to him that he didnt have permission and that the truck needed to move as we needed the loading dock space he then proceeded to yell at me call me worthless explained how he was so much more important than i was how he made my yearly salary in a month and most importantly he wasnt moving the truck and he would get me fired if i kept harassing him as i started to respond he just turned and walked away as he was too busy to bother with me i was furious its bad enough to be a disrespecting asshole but to also threaten my job was too far i followed after them and asked them really quickly what company they were with got the company name and left them alone i went back to the control center and called the company i explained who i was that the truck was illegally parked that the contractor threatened to have me fired for asking him to move the truck and that he refused to speak with me about the issue as he was worth too much to bother with a lowly security guard we spoke for a few minutes as she apologized and asked me what i wanted to happen i just asked that the contractor be spoken with as that level of disrespect is unacceptable and lastly the truck had to be moved pretty quickly the truck was moved and the night supervisor for the floor build came and apologized the contractors were friends of his he had given them permission to park there as they were helping out for the next few weeks on the job he paid to park the truck himself and it cost over to park just for the night in the closest lot he didnt come across as actually apologetic at all more a guy doing damage control for his friends this is where the revenge gets pro in parking is petty at best the next day i ran into one of the contractors i was on great terms with we would often talk for a while when we could he explained that he was the lead for the entire build on the project which i hadnt realized previously i thought he was just one of the regular guys he spoke with the night supervisor and heard about the issue chewed out the night supervisor for handling the situation so poorly fired the subcontractors from the job and blacklisted them from ever doing business with them again the main contractor company was a huge company that is constantly doing work with the property management company who own around a third of all the major buildings in that city and similar amounts in most of the other big canadian cities not a company you want a bad reputation with 
had a neighbor many years ago with a pack of chihuahuas that they didnt take care of much other than to feed them yappy little fuckers would crap all over my yard and run over snarling and growling snapping at your heels just trying to get in the door from the car theyd run up the steps and try to follow you in going ape shit the whole time i knew the neighbors knew because i saw them watching with smirks tried to kick the little shit bombs but they stayed just out of range animal control did jack squat about it finally i took a shovel and started flicking all of the dog poop onto their roof after several weeks of it building up it rained the literal shit storm that ensued was like rotten gravy train pouring over the sides the dad was cussing and yelling trying to dodge his family onto the porch out of the diarrhea rain when they got home much glee was had the dogs stayed in their back yard after tldr neighbors house rained dog shit upon them
 this occurred in my second year of university i opted to live in the dorm again in an apartment style dorm room i had three roommates apple orange and melon apple apple was clever she refused to stop smoking weed but knew the university had a heavy fine for being caught smoking legal or illegal so she mainly squatted at her dealers apartment and i had no problem with that orange she was from a very small town was easily intimidated and simply wanted to be left alone we get alone just fine melon melon was the problem when you applied to the dorms you checked off what you liked and disliked in terms of noise levelstudy habits and guests apple orange and i all wanted quiet no guests and we all took school very seriously melon wrote the same thing on her application but that was a lie she wanted to party and she wanted to party hard it started with her leaving her room for days at a time and not turning off her laptop which played an adhan muslim call to prayer times a day and had to be shut off manually at first it wasnt bothersome everyone makes mistakes and a quick call to the ra and she came down keys in hand and turned it off but it began happening days a week and finally i complained that this was driving me insane melon was given orders to fix the problem she turned the function off cleanliness there were bathrooms to a dorm room and apple and i shared so i basically had my own bathroom and orange and melon shared orange tried once to ask melon to clean the bathroom and melon snapped and began screaming at her threatening her and this began the bullying i didnt learn about this for months revenge the first i walked into the dorm room and smelled pot i checked apples room since she openly admitted to smoking and she was squatting still orange wasnt in and that left one person i put my ear to the door and heard a large group of people and turns out melon decided to have a pot party fully knowing that the of us agreed to have no smoking at all the fine was huge and i hate the smell of any smoke i casually walked down to the ras room and told her i smelled smoke from melons room and i had some papers ra needed to sign anyway so why not come to my room and sign the papers ra comes smells smoke opens door and finds the smoking and melon is busted with a fine revenge the second melon liked friends and she liked having her friends over but never at reasonable times she would invite her friends over at am during midterms finals and theyd be loud i got sick of this immediately and i tried asking melon to have people over when her roommates werent sleeping she told me to go fuck myself and if i wasnt having people over at am i must have no friends not sure about that logic so after she invited a bunch of guys over who began yelling to each other about what food to order i got my revenge she left her keycard on the table and these cards had to be swiped to get into the building and your personal room the first time i simply demagnetised the card and the second time i threw the card away a replacement card cost this wasnt working so i came up with a better plan i demagnetized the new card so when she tried to come into the dorm room at am with a bunch of drunk assholes the card didnt work and she began banging on the door and rattling the knob this time i called the ra and security and said i thought someone was breaking in caught with a bunch of drunks that early and with that level of noise cost her in fines revenge the third no animals were allowed in the dorm i was hearing scratching noises and i was worried about mice or rats melon was filthy in terms of food disposal and storage and i knew she wasnt home but shed propped her door open i poked my head in and lo and behold there is a rodent of some sort gerbil or hamster in a massive cage i got pissed off because there carpet had urine and faeces on it and im fairly sure that urine and faecal matter probably could carry some sort of disease i closed the door and called ra and said there was a scratching in our room and i was worried about rodents ra came and opened apples door finding nothing my room had nothing and oranges room had nothing but melon had a rodent that was a fine for the animal and something else for carpet cleaning i think melon began to get suspicious of me i always made sure that it was other people busting her and i always planned things well if she did she never tried anything but i was unaware that melon was taking her anger out on orange i liked orange a lot she was sweet shy and could not be mean if she tried i was writing an essay once and i heard noise that was louder than my headphones and i slid them off and heard melon screaming and threatening orange i opened my door and saw orange in the corner crying and trying to ball up and melon was standing over her just shrieking i called the ra for non nefarious purposes and grabbed orange and let the ra restrain melon this time a big meeting was called and orange spilled everything melon was stealing toiletries from her eating oranges food etc etc the rules were set no guests in the room from pm to am melon was furious melon had to pay orange for the toiletries and food melon was told that one more toe out of line would incur a massive fine we were all told to basically stay away from each other when final exam time came no guests period for anyone i felt really guilty that i never knew what orange was going through i apologized a lot and i kept watch my last revenge at this point we were getting close to the end of the school year and melons parents were calling a lot and were furious at the amount of money she had accrued in fines and i really thought she was going to stop being such an asshole but i was wrong melon decided to blow off some of her final exams genius and have a bunch of friends come over they came over at am and tried to have a quiet party i woke up because i heard glass breaking on the floor and vodka began seeping under my door i had an exam in the afternoon i did not need this shit melon knocked on my door and i feigned sleep and when i heard her say dont worry shes not home i called the ra and let the hammer fall her parents were called and they apologized to orange and i and im not sure what the final fine was she had planned to spend her third year of university in the dorms again but the ra was so frustrated with her asshole behaviour she wrote a letter to the head of the board and said that letting her back into the dorms would be a huge mistake the last time i saw her her parents were loading her shit into a van and she waved at me and it hit me i dont think she really knew it was me the whole year every time she got busted every fine was because of me there is something very pleasurable about anonymous revenge im not sure how to explain it tldr over the span of one year i made sure that my roommate was fined for every asshole thing she did she does not know it was me
this story is a little old taking place around or so anyways during that summer there was a rash of punks who would go and vandalize houses cars and pretty much anything else they could do to raise hell it was so bad that they would keep stealing the hub caps off of my fathers grand national as well as try and get in to steal the radios and change he was forced to keep it unlocked as it was cheaper then them breaking the windows the police would always take their sweet time getting here it would take minutes or more to send one officer here even though i could walk to the station in that amount of time by then they kids would have run off and gotten away my father is an engineer by trade and decided to get back at them as right after he replaced the hub caps they would be there that night to take them my father went to the hardware store and bought some wires razor blades and grabbed a few car batteries he had in the garage what he did was truly diabolical he took a little glue and on the inside of the door handles ge secured razor blades to cut anyone who atempted to open the door next he stripped some of the wires he got and wrapped them around the hub caps making sure they were pressed tight against them he took annother wire and used a little tape and glue to have the wire hovering over the wires so that if someone were to grab them it would complete the circuit and either burn or shock them eventually he was able to get them all rigged before running the wire ends back to the batteries he connected them and then went inside that night my father left the windows open slightly so he could listen for them sure enough sometime after midnight those little shitheads came back but after a few yells they seemed to leave rather quickly the morning reviled a fair amount of blood around the handle which then trailed down the drive way one of the hubcaps melted slightly from the heat of the wire but the others were not triggered needless to say they didnt seem to come back after that one i just wish we had a security system that also had a camera so i could watch those morons get it
so this happened about years ago i used to work for a technology company in a government incubator it was a building that helped start up companies by offering very cheap rent one of the companies was an animation company the owner was a complete douchebag whenever you would run into him he was always a complete dick anyone that knew him hated him it was a small company only staff members for the first couple of months honestly i dont even know how he survived that long the animators were terrible and by terrible i mean what the fuck did i just watch terrible but this guy was an amazing salesman he managed to sell himself and his company to a hip hop group in california being from a fairly small city in canada halifax this was a big deal it made the business sections in the newspapers and he even won an award for top ceos in the region the new contract landed him millions of dollars with around million upfront but he didnt have enough staff to take on this new animated mini series he immediately hired approx additional animators all naive students right out of college after a couple of weeks his new staff still wasnt being paid i knew a couple of people that worked there including one of the original who was receiving a small paycheck and asked her what was the deal she told me that he said he didnt have any money and that the money was coming soon he somehow convinced most of the animators to continue working for free he insisted that if they stuck around they would all become rich and it would make all their personal portfolios look amazing considering most of these kids had no experience they didnt quit once i found out about his claim of having no money i contacted a local magazine its a political magazine that likes to report on businesses and politicians that are corrupt they emailed me back and i told them everything i knew about this animation company and what the owner was doing well the magazine did some digging and published an article about the owner after their investigation they had learned that the ceo had in fact received million up front for the project but instead of investing it into the company he spent it all on himself including a new home valued over new cars etc you can only imagine what happened next pretty much every employee quit the day after the article ran the group from california sued him shortly afterwards because they invested that money and got nothing back the ceo was taken to court he was sued by of his previous employees awarded to each employee he lost his home car and was now seen as a joke in the industry after all this he moved to a different province but things got worse he had to file for bankruptcy claiming in liabilities one of my exemployees recently got a job at the same magazine i asked him if he could look through their archives to see if the information i had leaked to them is what caused their investigations sure enough it all started because of my email correspondence with their editor
i work at a grocery store i do my job and i do it well im known as the person everyone can count on and im well liked and respected my coworker has worked there longer than me she went to college and considers herself better and smarter than everyone else she constantly acts like she is the boss of the place and is always telling me what to do and making up rules that arent needed if anyone makes any kind of mistake she makes a huge deal about it she has to go around tell every single person if someone messes up something in production she brings it around and shows it to everyone she also constantly complains about the way people do things even things that arent relevant to her job at all for example at night the closers have to go and get packaging that we use to package what we make i tend to wait until something is actually getting low and grab a whole box of the item from the supplies area in the back of the store rather than grabbing a tiny bit of everything every night because i think it wastes time to most people it doesnt matter what way you do it because either way it gets done not this girl she constantly complains about me doing it this way and says that i never fill the packaging and i dont do anything but sit around when i close she constantly goes to the managers about this issue and they ignore her because it doesnt matter so she complains loudly and often about how our managers are idiots who dont know how to run anything she does shit like this constantly i used to just ignore her but i finally snapped i came in the other day and she had gone around telling everyone and all of the managers that i hadnt pulled the icing out of the fridge the night before so it would be soft for decorating cakes in the morning she gave me a lecture when i walked in and i informed her that yes i did i pulled several buckets she then responded oops i thought you didnt i didnt know the date yesterday so we had plenty of icing for the day but she was going to yell at me anyways because in her eyes i shouldve pulled more anyways she had also already gone around telling all the managers and my coworkers that i didnt do it and didnt bother to apologize or correct herself to anyone making me look bad i was done this happens so damn often so done i proceeded to go on facebook and print out every instance of her insulting a customer on facebook for the last few months this was easy because she never shuts up and posts long angry tirades often when i was done i had different posts that were at least a paragraph long her page is completely public so anyone can see these in the posts she called customers various things disgusting pigs because when she was eating lunch she could hear someone chewing next to her that she wished she could slap the fuck out of them idiots had terrible taste mocked a black customers name along with a picture of her cake called a customer a crazy bitch and called our shoppers lazy fatasses because there was a loose shopping cart in the parking lot so i gave it to my manager who is taking it straight to hr today our company takes this kind of thing extremely seriously since we are all about customer service i cant fucking wait she will have no idea who did it either because she has pissed off everyone it could be anyone

hi there first time poster english is not my first language so please be generous with typos and stuffs heres my story about a year ago i was getting home after long session of physical activity with gf i was pretty tired so the plan was get ass home shower lay on bed forever before i get to the point i need to tell you a bit about the place i live in i live in an apartment in a building kinda out of town building has two gates a small one for peoplebikes and a large one for cars there are parking lots inside for residents however we often lament that there is not much room for parking cars inside just in front of the large gate there is a large area that can be accessed right from the street and is actually part of the property so i have taken the habit of parking my cara small one just there on the side of the large gate this way there is more room for the other residents inside and i dont need to carry the remotekey for the large gate which i always lose anyway for those that are just passing by it is not really clear that the large area is actually part of the property so people sometimes park there thinking it is a free space after we explain the situation people always move without problems but we got tired of this so we recently put some no parking signs inside the area and this stopped happening ok so i was tired and in need of rest i get home and i see a big van some electric implant company parked right in my spot i usually dont get mad at these things but i was tired and the guy parked right in front of the no parking sign i cannot park anywhere else since i would block the way inout of the other residents so i park in front of the large gate get out of my car and approach the van on the passenger seat there is a large lady l and i signed her to open the window i kindly explained her that this is a private property and she needs to move the van l but theres nowhere else to park me i am sorry but as i told you this is a private property and i need to park here l why cant you park next to us me it would block the way of the other residents isnt that obvious l oh so you live here then why dont you park inside at this point i would like everyone to notice that there is absolutely no need for me to explain why i cant park inside all she needs to know is that she is on private property and needs to go anyway i explain the situation and she told me that the electrician her husband was making repairs in the building next to mine and in minutes they were leaving now i am a bit pissed because i already know is not going to be min and i would have to go and up and down at least once to move the car and if someone wanted to get inout in the meanwhile they would rightfully be mad at me so i just leave the car there and go to my apartment thankfully i have a window which let me see just the entrance and can check if they are still there after min they are still there i need to rest and i am pissed so i go to confront them l tells me that the guy came back but only to get some new stuffs from the van and needed to do extra repair me why didnt you tell him to move the van l he said it was only going to take min how is this an answer me i am not interested in that you need to move the van l just relax i am more pissed now me listen i kindly asked you to move the van if you dont i will call the police and have it removed l alright alright i will try to call him but he probably wont answer l calls the guy but he wont aswer the phone l see see laughing she starts to show me the ringing phone as if this is something that i am supposed to be interested in l see he wont answer me i dont care you need to move the car why dont you tell me where he is i will tell him l he is in that building but i dont know which apartment ufff i cant ring every apartment just to find the idiot i give a look inside the van and i see that he left the keys there me hey you have the key there why dont you move the van l ahahahahah are you crazy he is gonna be mad ahah me i dont care you must move the van l just relax i cant do anything just waith here and tell him when he comes back now i am really pissed i dont say anything and i just start to walk in circles like a shark after min fat electrician fe finally shows up he is tall and at least pounds i approach him but he starts to shout at me first fe what is the problem me this is private property you cant park here move the van fe why cant you park inside arghhhhhhhhh me i just cant ok move the van or i call the police fe you know what fine call the police he ignores me get some stuffs from the van and went back to his work now i could have called the police but i am not sure they would have had the van removed and i might have caused a big fuss for nothing but police or not those people were going to pay revenge mode on i took pictures of their license plate and the name of their company with my phone then got in my car move it and parked right behind them i was like inches from the back of their van stupid fe parked like inches from the no parking sign my car was behind it and a small wall was on their left the right was free but theres no way they could have maneuvered out of it more important the passage was now free and the residents could go inout i tell doublel i got their license and datas just in case they were to try damage my car and that i would be back in a couple hours to move the car if i remembered to i went back to my apartment and turned tv on after min i hear people screaming at the entrance i took the interphone and asked what was the problem fe is crazy angry and wants me to move the car alright i got it i am coming went back to watch tv another min pass and more screaming this time i go fe you have to move the car right now me why this is my property fe you cant block my way i got work to do me fine call the police i am not sure the police would have removed his stupid van but sure as hell they werent going to remove my car from my property at this point fe is really mad and start screaming obscenities one thing i didnt notice he had a lot of large electrical stuffs on the ground cables and others but he couldnt put it back in because his stupid van didnt have a lateral entrance but only in the back where my car blocks the way why am i telling this because it is starting to rain all his stupid things could get damaged i notice he also understand the situation so i say me ok ok how about i do you a favor i will move my car but you will have to pay me say fe are you fucking with me me as you wish you can pay me or call the police and see if they give a shit about you if you dont pay i will move the car in a couple more hours fe starts screaming more obscenities get into the van and comes back with my money i take my money and move the car fe and l load their stuffs and leave at full speed no one should ever be in my spot 
this is going to be long i apologize i tried to be brief but you have to know how awful this girl is so my boyfriends brother joe was dating this girl amber and nobody liked amber when i first started dating my boyfriend zeke he asked if id like to hang out with joe and amber one night go on a double date i said sure well on the way there zeke warned me that no one liked amber he said she was stuck up and rude im not the type to base my opinions on what others say so while i heard what he said i told him i appreciated the heads up but id make my own decisions about her well she was awful indeed shed give everyone dirty looks throughout dinner she wouldnt talk to anyone but joe unless addressed directly and then youd get an eye roll and a one or two word answer also shes a big girl i have nothing against big girls but she dressed like a cheap hooker in clothes far too revealing and too tight for her with thick black eyeliner cakey makeup and ratty hair joes a sweetheart decent looking funny generous kind gentle friendly just all around a great guy in every way possible he has been like a brother to me and i love him like family anytime joe and zeke would try to hang out amber would complain on the rare occasion that joe and zeke got to hang out it would usually be with their other brother todd todds a nice guy nice wife cute son we all get along great except when amber is there so when the boys got to hang out id usually stay home because they got so little time together but sure enough amber would be calling and texting and bitching the whole time about how joe was always so busy and its not fair and when is he coming home it was ridiculous at one point about a year into dating zeke joe called us and asked if we would give amber one more shot he invited us to dinner asked us to really just try because he loved her and he was at the end of his rope if she couldnt get along with us he was done we all agreed to go amber made an effort so did i we became friendly we had lunch and wen shopping a few times joe seemed relieved amber had bought a kitten kitten grew into a cat then she decided she wanted a lab puppy instead i asked what she was planning on doing with the cat she said she was going to drop it off on the side of the road in the country i begged her not to i asked her to bring the cat to my apartment where we are not allowed pets and id find the cat a new home just dont drop it off on the road as a coyote would probably find it and kill it she laughed and said i dont care i hate that cat i want my puppy again i asked her to please give me the cat no dice the cat got dropped off on the side of the road and i never saw it again so she got a lab puppy a sweet pretty little lab girl who loved to cuddle and give puppy breath kisses about six months in she decided she wanted a chihuahua so she got rid of the black lab without notice we still dont know what happened to the black lab but who cares she got her teacup chihuahua then he proposed amber said yes and went back to crazy zeke was asked to be the best man i was not asked to be in the wedding party which was honestly fine with me to be honest i didnt trust the dress she would have put me in and i didnt want to have to pay for all the extras well she asked me to come to a dress fitting for her i said sure and asked when she could pick me up since zeke had our car that day she had to pass my house on her way too the dress shop anyway i was sick and it was pouring out portland or rain is not uncommon here amber replied no you can take the bus i politely said id attend a different fitting she then invited me a few weeks later i said sure and planned on going well she cancelled on me the morning of the fitting saying she wanted to go with another friend at a different time and if i couldnt get off work i couldnt come well i wasnt taking time off work so again i declined but said if there was anything else i could help with just let me know and i volunteered my time effort and money to make their wedding favors by hand i bake and was going to do a chocolate dipped cookie for them and decorate the cookies in their wedding colors wrap them in pretty bags and tie ribbon on them for over guests about a week after that zeke and i invited joe and amber over for dinner and game night which is something we all try to get together for on a biweekly basis they came over and zeke asked amber how wedding planning was going amber had the nerve to look right at me and say well if someone would help me it would be a lot easier what i later sent her a facebook message that stated since i was not related to her in the wedding party or being paid by her that she had no right to ask me for anything for her wedding and that anything i volunteered to do was because i wanted to and was not obligated to do anything morethat was all i said no angry words no meanness no name calling just straight forward well she had a field day and told joe that i called her a bitch and cnt i saved screen shots of the messages and the messages themselves on facebook i tried to tell joe i didnt say anything mean to her or call her any names but she had found a way to tamper with the messages and had written in terrible things that looked like they were from me zeke knew i never said anything mean to her he saw the messages before i sent them he watched me type them because i wanted to know if he minded me sending them and wanted to make sure i didnt come across as mean or unnecessarily harsh joe wasnt having it he was understandably upset with me thinking i had said these things i then found out she had told other people the same lies about me that i was verbally attacking her calling her names etc none of that was happening by the way and anyone who knows me will tell you i am very friendly and smiley and im nice to everyone now around this time we found out that i am pregnant their wedding was scheduled for six days before my due date for about weeks i stewed not knowing what pregnancy hormones would do to me not wanting to go to the wedding and say or do something awful if provoked i asked zeke if he minded terribly if i didnt go knowing full well id be a hormonal pregnant mess he said it was fine i then asked if i could write her a letter telling her what i really thought of her bones and all zeke said go for it as long as its all true but leave todd out of it he hates her but wants to talk to joe in his own way in his own time i said that was fine then reiterated that if i wrote the letter it would be brutally honest no holds barred im done kind of thing and that it could have some backlash from joe to zeke since id be telling her exactly how i felt zeke said as long as it was true go for it so i did i wrote her a letter telling her how selfish i thought she was how trashy tacky rude and shallow what a golddigger she was that she was a liar that the way she treated her animals was deplorable and to never contact me again and to remove my name from her guest list as i would not be attending i read it to zeke he said it was all true so send it and i did minutes later zekes phone is buzzing like crazy with texts from joe telling him to keep greyson in line shes saying things that arent okay zeke replied that everything i said was true he agreed to the message i sent zeke and joe yelled for about a half hour it wasnt fun well word got out to todd and his wife laura that id sent the facebook message i showed them the messages theyd all heard from amber that i was saying horrible things all of which i had proof that id never said then todd joe and zekes mom and dad heard about it all of a sudden everyone is admitting that they cant stand amber dad said he wouldnt stop the wedding but he wasnt paying another dime and if it went on he wouldnt attend todd was neutral but told joe he did not like amber at all but that he loves joe and hell support him no matter what a week later joe left amber she cried whined accused tried to get money from him etc and the whole time everyone knew i was the snowflake that caused the avalanche at first i felt bad but joe is so much happier its like hes an entire different person and so many people have thanked me for it saying they didnt have the guts to say what i said even joe thanked me like a week ago amber is still furious but i dont care shes single and being trashy lost her apartment and had to move back in with her parents and loser brother her job has gone to crap but at least shes doing it far away from all of us tldr boyfriends brother was dating a lying tacky trashy selfish golddigger was
been lurking for a while and felt it was time to give back this happened several years ago i was working full time at a mediocrepaying job while putting myself through college at night paying for it out of pocket this left me stretched on finances so i ended up in a less than ideal apartment complex and by less than ideal i mean that the cops maintained a presence there most of the time most folks kept to themselves but occasionally youd get someone that was just obnoxious living near you it was inevitable i knew it was my turn with an obnoxious neighbor when i first met him he was talking loudly in the breezeway of my building why he wasnt on the balcony of his apartment i dont know not wanting to be petty i just turned the tv up and ignored him it wasnt long before the talking got louder and my door started moving like someone was trying to open it i jerked it open and the guy about fell in it turns out he was leaning on it while having his conversation after politely letting him know that it was very annoying i give him an its all good and close my door immediately he refers to me using a racial slur in spanish to the person on the other end of the phone i may not be fluent in spanish but i know some important slang hed have parties all night sometimes with a dozen people in the breezeway getting drunk and rowdy there was always trash on the stairs eg half eaten cheeseburgers old milkshakes etc and cigarette butts everywhere his large pit bull would bark all day just about nonstop i could bitch about it and be the whiny neighbor or just bide my time until i graduate and then move graduation was only a semester away so i decided to bide my time coming home from school one night im walking through the parking lot reading my phone when i see a dog running at me growling its dudes pit bull rearing to attack me dudes girlfriend yells at him and he calls his dog off and breaks out laughing enoughs enough someones going to get hurt so i complain to the apartment manager but am told without proof their hands were tied great i live the next few months at the complex relatively incident free just the above annoyances until im woken up one week night at am theres screaming and crying in the breezeway lots of loud talking and the sounds of incoming sirens looking out my window into the parking lot and i see dude run by with his dog looking through the peep hole i see a girl in the hallway bleeding profusely turns out his girlfriend and her friend were drunk and raised their voices at one another the dog then attacked the friend mauling her pretty badly police didnt know where either dude or the dog was and the friend didnt want to pursue charges so they left shortly after they left dude comes back with the dog i did call the police and let them know that he and the dog were back but they never returned thanks police on my way to work the next morning i stop by the apartment manager and let her know about the incident again she says she cant do anything without proof i implore her to call the police and confirm but she refuses saying they get updates from the sheriff every month ultimately her problem was that due to legal reasons she cant seek to evict someone herself otherwise it might look like shes targeting a given race or something fuming about the situation while at work i managed to find the police incident report for the mauling online i printed it out and delivered it to her on my way home she had an appreciative look on her face and told me the eviction process would start before i could leave the building true to her word the bad neighbor was out at the end of the month according to the apartment manager they were pissed and cussing as they drove away turns out he had numerous warrants so had his girlfriend rent the apartment neither of them had family in the area the girlfriends family lived in another country so they had no one to turn to for a place to stay the icing on the cake was when the apartment manager let slip that when the next apartment called her for a reference shed kindly inform them of all incidents that occurred i dont know what happened to them but i do know they had a hard time finding a place to live tldr be an asshole to your polite and quiet neighbor enjoy being homeless

one time a wise man said to me a broken heart heals quickly if you dont let the pain get between the cracks or something like that after over years i thought meg is the one high school sweetheart her parents loved me i became a family member her brother just years older than her had a very rare disease and since the age he was on a wheelchair i was always there helping out driving him for his rehabilitation sometimes even hundreds of miles i have never accepted money for my services thats what family does they were rather on a poor side always beaten by life always struggling father in another country sending money getting every financial aid possible in a huge debt i wasnt doing too good but i decided to sacrifice my own pleasures for something that mattered to me i and meg had lived together in the past and we decided to live together again we didnt split mostly the decisions of living together or not were financially based i spent my whole summer to make our new place look better i put a lot of money in it besides working and fixing the condo i hadnt had time for anything else i was excited for meg to come back we hadnt talked much since she had a summer job in another country i understood that and i knew she will spend her earned money wisely after shell come back she came back and she was a different person short skirt heels a lot of makeup she was never like this always very modest generous appreciative and always helping to other people she had a very good heart and i didnt know what is going on i felt shes not meg any more not the one i knew she was very distant and i knew there is more i was patient and gave her time after enough time had past i asked her to take a drive with me which took little convincing i took her to one of our spots where we had shared a lot she told me nothing besides asking for a month break i didnt say a word but it felt in my hear like its over month break from what a relationship it doesnt work that way not for me i agreed and told her to take her time this break month was very hard for me didnt seem hard for her i still couldnt understand why she had changed so much yet i was helping out with her brother which even included helping him to get dressed and other basic tasks if you know what i mean one day when our good friend came to visit us with a bottle of wine meg started crying for no reason she closed herself in the restroom since our friend was there i asked her to keep an eye on her and i decided to take a drive since it helps me to think during the drive something occurred to me i just started to see everything as a whole picture suddenly all the dots were connecting themselves cheating has crossed my mind before but i am not a paranoid person and i dont let my emotions determine my actions but this time everything every small thing started to be a part of the puzzle i called my friend asking if megs ok and decided to give her some more time and get her little worried about me i knew her well and my plan was to make her emotionally involved in me with her not knowing where im at i knew she would feel out of control about the situation and i knew her emotions will explode at some point at least i hoped for that i went to see her mother it was a miles drive so i had some time to think megs mom also knew something was wrong and she was worried like every mother would i had a very close relationship with the mother having no choice i told her that i think its over between me and meg not going into the details her mother cried and it felt like a goodbye that was the last time i saw her when i was on my way back i got a text from meg that shes going home for a few days and shes in the bus now it had never crossed my mind to violate megs privacy but megs mother called me when meg was on the bus back to our condo her mother checked megs phone when she was at her mothers i just couldnt keep hanging like this any more the texts of course confirmed my worries about cheating however i have never seen the text on my own i asked her mother to not talk to her about that and she agreed when meg got home i wasnt there i decided to spend a few days at my friends place just to heat up her emotions what i tried to achieve was to make her feel that my behavior is out of ordinary unpredictable which would make her suspicious and feeling out of control i knew megs schedule and i got perfectly when she was in the middle of her morning shower i thought i will see something which would confirm my suspicions i hid under the bed so she wouldnt see me i heard her checking my stuff in the part of the room which was mine later checking my desk definitely looking for something she left but i knew her well enough and i decided to lay under the bed for another minutes sure enough she forgot something as always additional minutes under the bed and time to investigate my work was starting in hours so i didnt have much time nothing obvious after fast search and i couldnt find anything which she has taken from me but she definitely did and it didnt sound like an office supply it felt shameful but i felt i dont have any choice something definitely was going on i unscrewed her laptop unscrewed her hard drive and copied all the hard drive to mine after work i went to visit my friend whos a computer wizard i knew with his help i will get to the files i need much quicker finding the archive files isnt hard but how do you read them sure enough with his help and a little bit of time i was able to read everything from my computer just by skimming thru it was obvious for me cheating was just the top of the iceberg of the things i got to know i got back home and sure enough my checks are gone i couldnt believe it it was just not like her at that point i knew its over for life a few months ago i got an offer to move to the us where i live now nothing was there to stop me but whats my plan i can go i have the visa money but and then this amazing feeling of the adventure all my life i was very static very reasonable sensible and sane never done anything crazy i felt like to shake things up a little i mean a lot first things first i had to take care of the business as early as i could i closed my bank account changed all the passwords just in case and called the owner of the condo when meg was at work with the help of my best friend alex i packed all my belongings the owner of the condo came and she was sure impressed about the improvements i told her i had to move out and we need to figure out the way to terminate the contract after all she gave me the deposit back and i didnt have to pay this months rent and utilities she even agreed to reassign the internet contract to her she knew she will be able to get much better deal on the condo and since i was a perfect tenant she trusted me i told her my exgirlfriend will move out in a few days she made big eyes but no questions asked next was my job i went to see my boss showed my resignation letter and we said goodbye in peace no hard feelings i left a short note to my ex we have to move out you have time until date i also blocked my ex on my phone email and social media here is what i know from couple of our shared friends meg freaked out about the whole situation she told all the friends i was cheating on her she got in some trouble at work after she tried to steal some equipment and was fired she quit her school and until this day she doesnt have a degree she had less than semesters left she moved to the country where her new boyfriend was after about months since i saw her last time she got a baby girl not mine her boyfriend ended up in a jail for some reason and spent there months from what i know they are together but it isnt a happy relationship what i know from the mother nothing i decided to leave the family alone i thought it will be the best for all what i know from meg nothing she sent me birthday wishes twice which ended up in trash as soon as i got them she sent it to my parents house they dont live there theyre with me now but theyve kept the house what i did and i think hope happened i moved out and meg doesnt know what the heck is going on she sees the note calls to the owner who explains her the situation and thats how she gets to know shes my ex now she goes to empty my account but she cant get money with the checks since shes not a detective type and shes driven by emotions shes just furious i took every single thinggift i gave her i mean everything i could find and i donated it with her name she received a thank you letter from a local foster care house so she knows that her stuff wasnt stolen by me it was donated by her and she cant do a thing about it her car was technically mine it was a very crappy car at a shop for a repair during the events i bought it from our friend who was in need and since then she always wanted to get it back i sold the car back to her for the price of the car plus the repair cost asking her to give back the things left in the car to meg just to play some more evil i found on gumtree european craigslist a cheap ass bicycle which fit into megs car perfectly i hope she was smart enough to get the message lastly megs brother borrowed from me the equivalent of it was for hes new wheelchair computer and some minor stuff i decided i will just leave it i sent a package to megs brother and mother he lived with her and i stuffed it with his favorite things plus i bought him an xbox with some games it was a goodbye letter to him and the mother letting them know im moving to the us thats how meg got to know where i will be the letter didnt mention a word about her meg hates me her family loves me after time has passed i think i could do some things better like not digging in her laptop which makes me feel shameful at that time i felt it was the only option some things i have done i feel i couldnt do better moving to the us was the best decision of my life it was hard in the beginning but for sure i want to live here i havent visited my country since i moved years pass in months tldrexgirlfriend gets taken away everything even her family edit someone here had a problem with understanding how the hell i was able to copy gb in less than hours thinking that i had to unscrew a laptop to the i wrote here about imessages so thats number uno that tells its an apple machine to explain it was a macbook which requires just a few screws at the bottom side and than just or maybe even less to get the hard drive the files were copied using an you simply hook up the hard drive to the and drag the files how long did it take about an hour from what i i know i was able to make the whole operation in less than hours with getting to work on time walking distance nowadays i copy gb in matter of a few minutes to my laptop using and i assume the person who has a problem has to have a very old computer i dont remember if the hard drive had gb on it gb on it or just gb i remember its capacity was gb i assume it was sata ii rpm or rpm the enclosure was firewire files copied straight from megs hard drive to my computer edit a few people shown a concern here about the checks after a recent pm i feel its worth to explain checks in europe do not work like in the us same idea but they are not common not every bank will accept them in my country and bank the checks were more like actual money which had to be covered by money on the account or payed with cash they are used for the international transactions i sort of had to buy these checks i wanted to purchase a motorcycle from the us yamaha r since its much cheaper i was almost about to purchase it i had one check on one on and one on or something close since meg was my girlfriend she knew that i want to buy a motorcycle she knew how it works etc i decided to go with the check because with that kind of amount the fees with a bank transfer would increase the price in my situation the checks had only printed amounts it was up to me who i will write them to meg knew all of this as well as that i have even more on my bank account that were my life savings since i got my first job a sport motorcycle was my dream well i still dont have it all my saving i had to invest in my future in the us it will happen anyway 
about years ago i found out my ex had been cheating while i was out working a job that required me to travel in an attempt to fix the marriage i took a different job where i was home the job was in southern ga so we moved from nc we had a month old son who was obviously still in diapers this will be important later after trying for a few months she left me to go back to her boyfriends enter the large uhaul that she loaded almost everything we owned into while i was working i came home and all she had left was to hook the car up to the tow dolly she couldnt figure it out i refused to help her and went into the house in the empty bedroom i was greeted by a horrible stench she had left a diaper that was packed full of fresh baby shit and still warm she left in the uhaul to find someone to help her hook up the car and i took the diaper out and put it under the drivers seat of the car georgia in august is unforgiving she came back about minutes later with a guy who opened the door to the car and nearly puked while i sat in the house an laughed her brother later told me that they had to sell the car because the stench was in everything they almost had to give it away
so i was walking home from macdonalds and just refilled my drink before i left for my walk home as im cutting across the parking lot near a very busy street important later a car pulls up next to me and a girl with a nice white dress on asks me if i knew how to get to some chapel so as i walked closer to the car to tell them which way they should take the guy in the back and the girl threw eggs at me luckily only one hit my leg and the rest missed but i still had my large drink from macdonalds that was basically full so i threw the drink and managed to get it right in the window and got the girl right in the chest the pop exploded and drenched her and they sped off onto the busy street so i continued heading home and after a block or two i see them pulled over by a cop car im guessing they got pulled over for speeding on one of the busiest streets as i walk by the car i see the girl with a big brown splotch on her dress i just smiled at her and walked home
this is a long story but ive marked off the revenge and pro revenge bits with appropriate headings to facilitate skimming background around years ago i applied for a job working for a relatively small organization as a manager instead of the position i applied for they offered me a different job reporting to the person they hired for the management position still a step up in my career but not quite as good i accepted the job and soon after was invited out to dinner to meet my new manager lets call her sara i immediately became skeptical of sara she presented as a devout christian woman while throwing shade at her previous coworkers and jobs all of which raised alarms i my mind i resigned myself to being polite but distant from her rather than running away as fast as i could because i figured i might have the wrong idea about her yeah not so much as soon as we started working together she started pawning off much of her work to me she hated making phone calls which she was required to make so i got stuck with those she wouldnt return messages from clients so i ended up doing that too the organization was small and had a serious resource shortage something which was made worse by some recent system changes that were made right around the time we arrived her shirking was positioned as delegation since she dealing with fixing those systems issues the higherups saw it as a temporary issue and implored me to be cooperative soon i was working hours a week trying to keep up with the workload i got paid overtime but no amount of money can make up for constantly being thrown under the bus by your incompetent boss because i couldnt handle the workload i was being asked to manage nobody could when she would actually get called on the carpet for mistakes and issues she would yell and scream at me while simultaneously blaming me for the problems she caused meanwhile she was having long conversations with anyone who wandered past her doorway leaving at everyday with no overtime and smiling that selfrighteous smile of the oblivious sociopath i think she truly thought she was a great and successful manager i will point out that the people in upper management clearly noticed that something was up with the work in our department a year had passed and things werent getting betterthey were actually worse on my end since now i was so demoralized that i had cried a couple of times at work thus they didnt pay much attention when i pointed out that our work loads were inequitable and that i was basically working both of our jobs mine and saras without the appropriate tools since sara hadnt actually fixed the system issues she had been hired to manage other people in the organization didnt really understand the system issues because they never had to use the system revenge i finally decided that i was finished dealing with sara and needed to demonstrate the dysfunction to the higher ups i waited for sara to take a week of vacation and then promptly called in sick for two days once she was gone leaving the higherups to try and handle client issues for those two days i didnt answer any calls from the office during working hours despite having some frantic how the hell do i do what the client is asking me to do messages instead i waited until after hours claimed to have been sleeping due to medication and then left long messages detailing the convoluted processes of how the system worked or didnt i took the time to work on my resume and write up my resignation letter including an offer to stay for up to two months to facilitate a transition i didnt bear the lowertiered worked ill will and the money would be helpful if i could have a set date in mind so i felt ok with a longer notice period i arrived back at work after my illness and had three of the higher ups walk straight into my office shut the door and sit down what the fuck is going on here was the first thing that came tumbling out of the general managers mouth so i spent a good ten minutes detailing the system issues reminding them that i had consistently mentioned being overworked and not having the tools to do my job apparently sara unbeknownst to me had been badmouthing me to all of them calling me incompetent and slow once they told me that i said i found that surprising since she had spent all of that time badmouthing the system to me and calling the management incompetent one of the other managers told me that they were attributing the problems to me and my emotional state and now realized after just two days of trying to do my job just how awful things really were they apologized to me for doubting my claims and vowed to make changes i thanked them and handed them my resignation notice telling them that i had decided to go back to school to pursue a new career and couldnt do that while working for or with sara over the next two months before i finally left sara basically became a woman defeated i fed them every nasty word she said for two months including showing them some text messages i received in which she bad mouthed the organization the gm told me they couldnt fire her because anyone new would be even worse with the system but that they were taking steps to crosstrain others on the system in order to be able to get rid of her they monitored her office and interrupted long conversations they removed me from her control allowing me to return her delegated work and insist she do it herself we had long meetings about systems issues during which she was left looking like a bumbling incompetent after i finally left they had a little party for me they called her into the gms office and read her the riot act for basically chasing me out the door and costing the organization a strong employeetheir words not mine sara contacted me after being told off and expressed how sad she was that i would say such things i denied using the words they claimed i used saying only that i talked about the circumstances and not the people i lied purposefully in the faint hope that it would be useful to me in the future i had no great love for the management of the organization despite their recent attempts to make amends and it cost me little to play both sides her reputation was so bad at that point that nobody would believe her if she said i stuck up for her it wound up being a good instinct they fired her months later and told her not to use them as a reference she has basically been stuck in a series of temporary and lowpaying jobs ever since she left we are still social media friends and i have seen her messages about looking for help from god and tough financial times as much as i want to feel bad for her i cant muster up even a little bit of concern for her instead i enjoyed a little private laugh at every bad thing that seemed to happen to her call me a jerk but i view her as someone who tried to destroy my career to save herself some work coldblooded pro revenge so it has been nearly years as i said and i have finally had a chance to truly extract my pound of flesh from her last week she sent me a long email talking about our working together and how shes happy to see is things have gone well for me and how she looks back fondly on our work together she said she knows that we didnt work together ideally but that she had few options and wanted to ask me for a professional reference i jumped at the chance and reassured her that i held her no ill will here is my contact info just have them get in touch anything you want me to emphasize when we talk i got all the details and told her i would let her know when i got the call i finally got the call this past thursday i proceeded to damn her with as faint praise as i could possibly muster i really put on the hollywood touches weird vocal inflections thoughtful pauses before tepid endorsements seemingly careful and precise word selection they must have heard from others about her penchant for talkativeness because they asked me point blank about that too i went super cagey in my response i mean she certainly is friendly enough but i cant recall any personal experience with her being distracted from her work by talking too much of course i spent so much time in my office that perhaps i just didnt see it got the word this morning thanking me for the reference and saying they hired someone else for the job i expressed my condolences and told her to feel free to let me know if she needs another reference she told me she would definitely be in touch tldr there once was a manager lady whose actions were all sorts of shady i got her ass fired she tried to get hired used my reference to keep her in hades 
in college my roommates and i three a lot of parties they were well attended because we always kept a friendly vibe going on and would make you leave if you were being an ass these guys from the next apt building over show to to one and are being pretty obnoxious but tolerable where they waaaaaaay crossed the line was this one girl got too drunk and she wasnt with anybody who could take her home so we put her in my bed gave her some water and a bowl for puking if that needed to happen ill crash on the sofa tonight no bigs one of the douchey crew is seen hovering around my bedroom doorwe keep an eye on it hes suspicious to me but theres room for doubtso we give him the benefit of it but when he thinks nobodys looking he goes in there one of my roomies was watching though and goes in after him i will skip the predictable discussion that was had he tried to say he wasnt doing anything but he took a good while coming up with a lie we told him and his roommates to beat it they actually argue with us as if they have a right to negotiate with us about whether or not they can be at our apartment after one of them almost certainly tried to rape someone they got physically intimidating but i can tell actual prelude to violence from facesaving chest pounding send them on their way firmly but without escalating we seriously couldnt believe what almost happened and the more we thought about it the more pissed we got justice must be served we got a ten gallon bucket and put it on the deck we instructed every guy at the party that he had to pee in the bucket a few girls even hiked up their skirts and contributed to the fund we stayed up super late drinking beer until the bitch was damn near topped off put the lid on it carried it over to their door tilted it against the door and tied a string from it to the doorknob next morning we woke that girl up fed her eggs told her what went on and we all drank coffee on our deck while we waited for those shitstains to open the door bloosh

tony is the well behaved respectable kid that went on to get great grades and go to college well tony ended up creating his own company they do networking and servers and stuff like that me well i became the gsm of different dealerships my job is basically the shot caller well i dont so much call the shots more as review the decisions my managers make now of course with tony being my brother and our families are close knit his wife my wife his children my children are always together with this tony and i bounce ideas off each other all the time and are pretty in tune with each other business heck i help fund the early days of tonys company and a major shareholder so i do have my influence which i never really usecause i dont know anything about his business how it works etc now tony was in the final stages of bidding on a massive contractbasically as he explained it the contract was his and he was searching internally for the team to run this contract and he needed a project manager he already had the pay plan for this position put together and whoever got it would make a shit ton of money and there was quite a bit of completion internally for this position especially among prime individuals maurice and allen both equally qualified however my brother was leaning towards maurice since he was with my brother for years more than allen now i didnt actually know either one of them so i gave my brother my general advice which was if both can do the job and only one can have one give to the guy who has been with you the longesttherefore maurice was to get the position my brother said hed mull it over the weekend and make the big announcement that friday now with me being in this business as long as i have ive grown to develop relationships with many different employers and many of them i have special pricing deals with them tony company of course receives a special pricing deal all his employees have to do is show their badge and we apply a discount to their order since they work for tony now of course we do have some models which we have disqualified from this incentivefor various reasons one of them is the ford raptor which is a hot seller and a major profit generator for us so its excluded well i do my rounds to the different dealers i manage and had stopped by a ford store which was having some employee issues as is fairly common in this industry and putting together a plan with the store manager when a sales person popped in and said he needed the store manager to handle a difficult customer i of course enjoy getting involved in selling cars its a welcome relief so i inquired about the dealturns out it was maurice who works for my brothers company wanting a ford raptor i told the store manager to stay put and ill handle this so i walk out to greet maurice maurice is insulting my dealership my employees and our practices i pride ourselves on being above board on everything so this really pisses me off never the less maurice is a potential customer and should be treated with respect i sit down with maurice and qualify him to see whats up maurice is under the impression that this friday is going get a major promotion and has decided hes going treat himself to a nice brand new toya brand new ford raptor thankfully the car gods have given us the exact model in options and color that maurice wants which of course is the reason why maurice is at my store and not wanting to leave my store without the truck however isnt understanding his coupon does not qualify for the ford raptor and that he should be happy we are only charging him sticker on a truck that traditionally sells for above sticker i of course try to explain this to maurice who calls me a scumbag this is of course the short version and maurice is being a general douche i do some quick thinking look up to maurice and say if i honor the pricing agreement that you believe i should honor will you purchase today maurice happily responds yes so i have finance start up the paperwork and several times throughout this process i over hear maurice insulting my employees dealership and reputation this is something i do not tolerate in my opinion the most important asset which i have are my employees they generate the revenue which pays my bills however i was going let this one slide till the very end finally maurice is done with finance the vehicle is funded and hes ready for delivery i tell the operations manager ill personally handle this delivery and he calls me over as soon as the walk around is ready so i begin showing maurice all the options and features that the ford raptor offers hes like a kid in a fucking candy store so happy with his purchase still thinks we are scumbags though finally we are done the paperwork is signed maurice is sitting in his brand new truck and im standing outside of it when i saw me hey tony is the guy that will be promoting you on friday right maurice yea do you know him me sure do hes my younger brother mauricereally me yup in fact many years ago when tony was just a small startup i convinced the owner of this dealership to finance his company i am confident without our support tony would of gone bankrupt in the early days of the dot com bubble mauricei didnt knowim so sorry for me nah dont worry about it you go ahead and enjoy your new truck now poor boy wanted to cry i was grinning from ear to ear got into my office called in the sales person his manager and even finance who this guy also treated like shit and called up my younger brother tony allen really enjoyed his new promotion and used the bonus to pay off his house and put a massive down payment on his first rental property editted i tried to clean it up im a pretty shitty writer 
saw this and thought it belonged here seems more professional than petty to me but hey gtprnmeds day ago registered nurse here my manager doesnt do a good job of being personable and comes across very robotic its difficult for me because my intrinsic drive doesnt respond well to criticism even of the constructive type which she doesnt usually provide shes more a negative criticism type of manager i received an email from her on my day off full of passive aggressive bullshit about how i had made a mistake a physician had wanted a patient to go for a test and the patient needed to follow certain instructions take this medicine the night before then nothing by mouth after midnight type of instructions the order went in at pm i work pp the nurse coming on for the night shift didnt communicate with the patient that they werent supposed to eatdrink after midnight and the test was unable to take place i didnt recognize the name of the patient in the email and went back and checked the patient assignments for that particular day as it turns out i wasnt the nurse taking care of that patient my day off had been ruined by thinking i had screwed up when i wasnt even involved i sent her an response letting her know that i had nothing to do with the care of that patient i also informed her that it was a direct violation of that patients hipaa rights private health informationprivacy act for her to have shared with me a person who had absolutely nothing to do with the patients care both the patients name what he was being seen in the hospital for and specific details about the tests that were going to be performed on him i told her i regretfully had an obligation to report the incident to medical records because a breach of privacy had occurred and included a screenshot from the mandatory bullshit training we do online every year about phi private health information 
preface i read this on a russian forum and im translating it here i have no way to verify whether this is true or not but the forum is somewhat reliable and the revenge is amazing for a bit of context the russian military has special days for different branches of service where veterans of those branches get shitfaced and act like idiots there are border guards day tanker day paratrooper day and a few others heres the actual story once upon a time on august nd a sad story took place in our town drunken paratroopers ganged up on a middleaged azerbaijani man called him slurs and beat him up the paratroopers made a mistake timur sultanovich isnt a churka a racist slur but a wellrespected and a wellconnected man hes well respected enough and wellconnected enough to have the culprits licking his shoes clean the next day but uncle timur as everyone calls him is a kind man theyll punish themselves he said all it took is a few meetings some phone calls and a bit of money relatively and next year next year on august st a new brand of vodka was delivered to all stores in the town it was called paratrooper it was very cheap and had a label with an image of a paratrooper smashing a bottle over his head as is tradition youve seen the youtubes the next day over idiots were hospitalized on paratrooper day some with concussions some with cranial trauma and fractures from trying to break the bottle over their heads the bottles were made of thick tempered glass 
this whole things started like years ago im right now back then i was kind of the kid who was bullied by the cool guys i never had the best grades but never had much friends maybe i just wore the wrong clothes i dont know there was one guy especially who never let a day pass without insulting me until he left the school for what ever reason some years later i was at that point i managed to finish school and worked for an design agency as an intern everyday we get a lot of stuff via parcel service basically we design stuff for clients and let it produce by what ever company gives us the best offer all this stuff comes to us first so we can take a look at the quality and send in to our customer this stuff can be heavy our rooms are located in the second floor so its standard procedure that the parcel guy rings the bell and one of the interns goes down opens the door and help the underpaid guy to bring the stuff all the way up time goes by and every time the parcel guy rings the bell i went downstairs to help him carry that stuff up until one day i opened the door and there he stands this waste of organs an blood who never let a day pass without making my life hell back in school he looked at me without recognizing who i am telling me he has some stuff for us and if i mind helping him to bring the stuff upstairs i signed and instead of helping him bringing this two dozen packages of ordered paper blocks upstairs and believe me paper can be fucking heavy i just told him the way stepping outside and lit a cigarette while telling him where he should carry all this shit he was not really happy to do all this on his own after delivering the last package he passed me standing outside while smoking my third cigarette in a row normally i dont smoke that much but i had to look cool d just waiting for that moment when he passes me to go back to his car the moment he passed me i said maybe you dont remember but karma does he turns around and looked me straight in the eyes and in this one moment i could see in his eyes that he recognized me he walked straight to his car without saying a word after that i saw him every other day since and when ever he is the guy who delivers all that stuff for us i stand outside and smoking a cigarette this went on for another two years he never changed a word with me nor did he looked me in the eyes since than im working there fulltime and we have another interns the first thing i teach them whenever this one guy rings the bell to bring us our delivery dont even think about helping him just sit outside and watch sorry for my english iam not a native speaker hope you enjoyed this anyways

the ex ex wife was psychologically abusive to me and the kids was a consummate liar and manipulator and did all she could to ruin me financially during and after the marriage she also tried vey hard and was successful for a few years at turning the kids against me she was and still is a nasty hypocrite the back story while married to her she was in the hospital for a minor accident and while in the hospital she asked me to help her out of bed so she could look in the mirror to see if she had bruises on her face from the minor accident i helped her out of bed and while at the mirror and in front of the sink she fainted and fell before i could catch her she hit her head on the sink and the fall broke her wrist when she landed on it i called the nurse and subequently they stitched up her lip and set her wrist a year or so later she contacted a lawyer to sue the hospital meanwhile we get divorced the divorce is nasty and she is nasty she tries to get me arrested many times when i try to see the kids on scheduled times she contacted all of my friends and tried to turn them away from me she hassled my parents and sisters first trying to be their frind and try to turn them against me and when that didnt work she attacked them with nasty phone calls and baseless accusations meanwhile her malpractice suit is proceeding and her lawyer wanted me to give a deposition to support it i agree but on the condition that they have to pay me for my time and costs the revenge at the deposition i was supposed to support their claim that the ex was not given instuctions about staying in bed and that the bedrails were not put up as a reminder for her to stay in bed and that consequently it was the hospitals fault that she was able to get up and then faint and fall i said that i didnt remember any of that that she demanded that she get up and that i help her and that we were not going to wait for the nurse to help in my deposition i told the truth as i remembered it my memory did not support her malpractice claim afterwards her lawyer dropped her case based on my deposition and tried to hit her up for costs but she screwed him like she did everyone else tldr my deposition scuttled her malpractice claim

so i got a call from my boyfriend who seemed really upset after auditing a class at his college he prefaced it by telling me that he almost killed a man today i laughed it off because he is too sweet and could never hurt anybody it turns out that he was in a class in which a true merican from texasreferred to as craig was spewing his ideals that west african people who are suffering from the ebola outbreak deserve their fate craig honestly believed that those countries deserved the virus because they cant care for their citizens as fate would have it my boyfriend being from guinea was very shocked that anybody could say those beliefs and write off a group of people especially people craig did not know my boyfriend is not mean or spiteful and literally has never even killed a spider in my presence i think this hurt him a lot more than he was willing to admit he told me that he wanted to say something to the professor and classmates but the moment passed the class was then grouped off to discuss something craig was paired off with a girl but she refused to be in his group she was from sri lanka my boyfriend walked over to be partners with him at introduction my boyfriend reached out and firmly grabbed craigs hand and continued to hold it my boyfriend then looked deep into craigs eyes and said im from guinea and paused seeing no recognition in craigs eyes my boyfriend added with a smile which is in west africa i have been in america for weeks but in fact he has been here for over a year craig didnt need to know that though craig started freaking out he sat down and my boyfriend could see this young man visibly shaking and sweat pouring out of him the class stopped what they were doing and stared at craig and my boyfriend they asked what happen and my boyfriend told them that he didnt know now he is afraid that he is going to get in trouble for lying he said he felt like he almost gave craig a heart attack but i had to share this it is too great i created this account just to tell this story i know he wont get in trouble edit my boyfriend is seriously considering not going to class next monday because he is certain that he is going to get harassed im secretly hoping he doesnt go so it will make craig think he died

i live in a state with constant signaturegathering efforts as a result of our muchabused citizen initiative system most signature gatherers are pushy but in an accustomed sort of way you see one ahead you drop your shades take a phone call anything to avoid them for the most part they acquiesce but not this one time my kids and i were downtown walking from the bus stop to one of the enormomultiplexes that typically host popular kids films it was a nice night and we were having a good time transiting a large public plaza i spy a chubby middleaged male signature gatherer standing near the corner ahead the gods of timing are not with us and we are stopped by the dont walk sign this is clearly his method the captive audience in all honesty i cant blame him wed be stuck at the crosswalk with him for s no more as soon as we stop he launches into his spiel after a moment or two i politely tell him not tonight man and return my attention to my kids he immediately replies no tonight and pokes me in the chest with the clipboard i am what cedric the entertainer called a grownass nobodys going to try and make me look like a chump let alone in front of my kids my first reaction upon being poked in the chest by this tool was to slap the clipboard out of his fat little hands however to do so would be to set what i knew to be an inappropriately violent amp confrontational personal standard for public behavior for my kids so in the words of oran juice jones instead i i did however happen to have a black sharpie in the leg pocket of my carhartts i looked the offending shitlord in the eye and said sure ill sign give it to me rather than use the ballpoint attached to the clipboard by a cunning array of knotted rubber bands i opted for my own pen found the first open signature blank and wrote fuck you in giant black letters the length of the signature entry the whole episode had eaten up our wait time at this point the moment the walk signal turned i handed the clipboard back to mr pushy amp stepped into the crosswalk talking and laughing with my kids i never looked back and they were never aware of the time their dad rolled some instant karma on a douchebag who tried to harsh the family buzz ed to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill sun tzu

 ill preface this by saying that i am a heroinmeth addict in recovery im not proud of the things i did but i got a kick out of this at the time a couple years ago i was out driving around doing my thing i had just scored some excellent black tar from my dealer i decided to call my buddy we can call him jay to hang out and get high with me so i went to go meet him in the parking lot of some scummy mexican restaurant in central phoenix i pull in and notice that he had someone else with him so i drove up to them and he insists that this kid needed to come too and i mean kid this little prick looked like he had just gotten out of middle school well call him chris chris had some meth on him and at the time i wasnt at all morally opposed to enabling hardcore drug usage among minors so i figured why not after a grimy session of speedballing i dropped them both off at chris moms house when i was pulling into chris street i took note of a comment he made about how he had stolen several hundred dollars worth of copper wire from his stepfather who was an electrician a few days prior about two weeks later i encountered the dreaded bimonthly event that took place in my junkie life style my dealer wasnt responding to my texts i called jay and he said i should send chris a facebook message he didnt have a phone he was using an ipod touch to communicate apparently chris had a dealer that lived a few blocks from his moms house desperate as fuck to not be writhing in the pain of opiate withdrawal i caved in to my reluctance and decided to meet chris at a gas station near his moms house long story short this little piece of shit ran off with my but he was coming right back lol it wasnt entirely unexpected but youd think that as a year old pound guy that knows where you live it would be safer just to take the finders fee apparently he forgot that i knew where he lived because he didnt respond to any of my facebook messages for minutes until i typed in the name of his street and told him ill see him in a few minutes he typed me this bullshit story about how he got robbed and that he would pay me back in a couple days im generally a nice guy and id rather avoid conflict especially with a year old kid so i agreed a few days went by and no word from him i messaged him about it but i didnt get a response i was just going to drop it until jay told me the kid was bragging about stealing my money this is the point that i realized i must have my revenge i drove over to his moms house and knocked on the door a middleaged woman answered obviously startled by my disheveled appearance yet politefully asked can i help you i replied yes are you chris mom she looked incredibly worried and confirmed that she was indeed the birthing unit of this little hellspawn i straightened my posture and put on my best concerned parent face and said im the brother of one of his friends i recently discovered that your son and my brother have been using crystal meth together and im very concerned about the both of them i didnt know if you knew or not by this time she looked like she was about to shit a brick but i thought id at least try to let you guys know so you can get him some help she welcomed me inside for coffee chris wasnt home and i suggested that she check chris for needle marks and gave her details about how he had stolen the copper wire from her husbands work van i heard from jay the next day that chris was being shipped off to florida for some sort of longterm inpatient treatment program peace out fucker 
im here to talk about the battle for my small community park this kerfuffle involves a large community and parent group and a bigoted protester who we shall call pm park man ampnbsp every morning on weekdays pm parks his pickup truck with a massive home made sign on the back right on the side of one of my towns busiest roads and most popular park just to ensure his ideologies are spread until late into the evening now there is nothing wrong with spreading your own message but park man took it to the extreme and eventually the town snapped pm started his campaign a while ago when obama was first elected he started off erecting signs with the usual obama is an illegal president he is trying to take over the nation etc of course there is nothing wrong with spreading your own political views but pm realized that posting his political views was not simply enough to get the public attention and decided to escalate he began to embellish his sign with much more hurtful much more racist messages such as islams will all go to hell obama is the devil and muhammad is a pedophile during my towns gay pride parade pm sat on a street corner and spewed bullshit out of his mouth for hours calling the marchers faggots and damning them to hell recently he drew the last straw by flying blown up images of aborted fetuses for everyone including children playing in the park to see ampnbsp now if pm was protesting in the deep south he might have been okay but my town hilo is extremely liberal peaceful and tolerant of pretty much anything except extreme bigotry racism and violence furthermore many parents stopped taking their kids to the park to avoid the racist messages and sometimes graphic images on the sidewalk feet away despite being extremely offensive everything pm does is protected by his right to free speech so the recent protests and petitions started by the community to oust him meant nothing and so pm persisted and even gained a small group of supporters ampnbsp something needed to be done and the community came up with a beautifully simple solution they realized that all though pm was protected by free speech the parking spot pm used for his billboard was not for the past couple of weeks a big group of concerned parents and other community members wake up early and snag all of the parking lots by the park and then leave when the park closes people working on nearby shops now leave their cars by the park and walk to work and some parents spend the whole day at the park with their cars in pms beloved parking space preaching peace and tolerance for the past two weeks the park has been free from pms truck his signs and the his small group of followers making my town just a little bit better ampnbsp tldr extremely racist mans right to free speech is protected but his right to a parking space is not ampnbsp edit maybe i will post this on rpettyrevenge i suck at finding subreddits and i thought this was the place i also found some videos and articles but they directly name pm so idk if i should post them
time late s place a medium size midwestern town players me an electrical contractor and guido the hot shot from new york city probably bayonne but who cares set up guido has shown up in town and announces he going to open up the first disco in town hes flying on borrowed money spends a ton on advertising and promotion rents a big space in a big strip mall and proceeds to hire local contractors to build his disco i come in with a man crew to do all his electrical it takes two weeks and then some because he keeps asking for more stuff and i oblige come payday two days before his grand opening i come in with an invoice for k expecting payment in full we sit down at a table he and i along with some lbs meatball who is a local i recognize he offers me cash for the whole job he argues that we didnt have anything on paper so i could take it or leave it i think about it for a minute and decide to accept so he gets up to go fetch the cash while hes gone i look over at meatball with a questioning look and as if he knows what im going to ask he said yes im here to keep you from beating his ass he furthered volunteered that i wasnt the only one i collect the and leave opening night the parking lot is filling up theres a line at the door and guido is up front collecting his door a head and i pull up in my ton all the way around by the back door i rig a chain and a pallet on the back door so he cant come out the back wrap a poly rope around the riser on his service tie the other end to my back bumper and jerk his meter clean off the wall making a huge shower of sparks buzzing and pops then calmly drive back around front and park at a fair distance from the front door after a minute or two of silence and darkness from the club people start spilling out demanding refunds apparently he wasnt interested in giving out refunds so after a few more minutes i saw or coked up rednecks drag him into the parking lot and beat the crap out of him empty his pockets and leave him laying there on the curb he left town inside of hours but wait theres more in a similar incident a couple of years later i got stiffed by a shitty biker bar for a couple of service calls not that much money or as big a deal but they threw a beer bottle at my van as i was driving away and the dent just set me off i came back at dusk on a friday night about a week later parked on the other side of the shopping center set up a ladder and carried my wire shears across the roof and snipped their power lines right at the weatherhead and left they called the power company who came out found the stubs sticking out of the weatherhead too short to connect to and told them they needed an electrician to come replace their riser before they could reconnect ever try to find an electrician on a friday night or a saturday or sunday lol it took until monday before the lights and coolers were back on i toasted about worth of beer in their coolers plus their whole weekend take moral of the story do not fuck with your electrician ps just for edification i didnt have this kind of problem very often i made most of my money off oil fields and only ran service calls to keep a trucksparky combo busy
i heard this one from a friend of mine who is a trucker although i cant prove that it is true the guy is an honest friend and hasnt made any shit up during the time ive known him anyway i figured id post it here he was sitting in a long traffic jam on i between nashville and chattanooga tennessee after drinking a lot of caffeinewatersoda since the traffic was at a dead stop and he had to pee he took a ziplock baggie from the back of his sleeper cab and emptied his entire bladder into it he zipped it up and got back into the drivers seat fast forward about minutes he still hasnt made any progress but his cb radio started going crazy anybody who has a drivers license has probably witnessed the self entitled assholes who drive on the shoulder of the interstate in order to get in front of traffic by doing this they are frequently blocking the only emergency access to the wreck these people piss me off as well as every trucker sitting in traffic so he was hearing reports of mustangs riding with the tops down with a bunch of frat douches coming up the shoulder at about mph he had a brilliant idea remember the ziplock bag of piss he got into the passenger seat of the truck rolled down the window and waited until the mustangs were in clear view as they reached his truck he threw the bag of piss out the window it slammed into the windshield of the first mustang spraying his trucker piss all over the frat douche passengers they then proceeded to take the next exithopefully to clean off all of the piss that had just coated them he got a round of cheers on the cb radio that day edit my gremaer is badd
my mom brother and i lived in a tiny shitty rented apartment owned by her half sister in the beginning she knew we were looking for a place to stay and begged for us to rent her unit because she needed the money desperately this aunt is not close to us barely meet in years she lives at her daughters place and allowed us to rent the whole unit and considering shes a family member its a good deal we thought we only had to pay the rental and deposit or some shit for in the situation of if we move out without notice on one of those months aunt couldnt afford to pay the utility bills for rubbish maintenance etc and my mom offered to help for that one particular month only even though it wasnt part of the rental agreement but the following month when utility was behind on payment again aunt gave mom a stern warning telling her to pay on time she somehow automatically assumes mom will pay it each month for her just because she did it as a favour once this means mom will have to pay like an extra on top of the rental cost each month but shes a nice person she didnt mind and wanted to help out my aunt thinking shes having financial difficulties and plus shes a family member we cannot say no or else word will spread in my country the government will give rebates once every year in the form of something like voucher to be used to pay the light and water bills bare in mind its just a piece of paper its just a voucher that minus from the bills you dont see the money every single and above citizen will receive this for their household but if you dont have a house you simply dont need to use it but aunt texted my mom and asked for it in cash she said since you dont need the voucher and its my house give me the money its ridiculous because the government gives this to everyone and its just a voucher to cut down the bills how can she ask for ours in cash her logic was that the rebates are to be used if you have a house and considering we live in her house she thinks its rightfully hers she said she needed the money to celebrate eid mubarak but we are a muslim family too we needed the money to celebrate eid too again mom was pissed but too nice to say anything and gave her the she think shes entitled to shes a relative and we didnt want issues the next year when the government gave the same rebate aunt asked for the same thing but including the amount of the voucher my brother and i received so mom got incredibly pissed and told my aunt off but aunt pretended she didnt know the voucher was just a paper and not cash from this point on there was visible tension and she hated us because she knew she cant trick my mom into giving more money for years she continually try to suck more money out from us because she knows we rather pay extra than have to look for a new place after years since moving in one night we had the rest of the family over for dinner like of them including my brothers fiance sister and her husband who dont live with us and our family friend after dinner we mused ourselves with the one finger lifting trick its basically a party trick where one participant will lie flat on the floor and people will lift the person up using one finger each something to do with weight distribution you can google it its a fun activity basically we recorded ourselves doing it for shits and giggles and i posted the video on facebook but my aunt found the video from a tip off by another relative and started commenting that we were having a disco and the doors and windows are open you are letting the neighbours see and embarrassing us whole day later she gave my mom an angry phone call which went like this aunt do you know your daughter is on facebook i was years old at the time wtf mom yes i know aunt do you know she has photos with her father parents are divorce but she thinks im not suppose to talk to my dad and take photos with him mom so aunt i saw the black magic video they are not suppose to do that in my house and its embarrassing me are you aware of what they are doing mom yes so ive seen it aunt youre a muslim lady and you wear a scarf over your head how can you allow your daughter to dress like that when she leaves the house the neighbours see and its embarrassing me mom then hangup the phone its really not her business in what i do or how i dress or whether or not i have contact with my father because this lady is just a distant relative we simply rent her house thats all she does not have any right to comment on my life the night we had family over was just a small gathering and we were not being noisy the end of the month mom did the usual thing and went to aunts place to pay for the rental and she along with her daughter gang up on my mom with some bullshit about having to sell the house were living in because the housing board changed some policy or method of payment which my aunt is not willing to do so they have to sell it in months unless we can fork out more money to continue staying there she told us to be gone by november too if we cant pay more mom just smiled and said ok we know its just bullshit and no such new policy they are just threatening to sell the house if we cant pay extra rent money that week we packed up our shit and moved to my sisters place we didnt need to give her any notice or warning because she told us to be gone by november after we moved she told my uncle that we owe her months worth of rent payment til november which she feels entitled to because she thinks we are supposed to live there til november altho never mentioned it and only told us to leave as soon as we can november was just a deadline she made but when we called her to verify this claim she said she owed us the deposit money instead which she must give back to us for making us leave aunt was greedy she was never going to sell the house she simply didnt like us because we refuse to give her the government rebate and so she was tried to make us pay extra she knew we were desperate for a house in the past and thought we were going to do anything and pay any amount to continue living in her shit house now she never thought we were capable of moving out and we are her only source of income so she immediately regretted it and told my mom that they cancelled plans of selling the house and begged for mom to stay so the revenge is this we played by her rules but moved out without any hint or warning which means bitch aunt didnt realise she needed to start paying the house on her own and she couldnt because we are her only source of income she is heavily in debt now nobody wants to rent her apartment because its in such a shitty condition and on top of that she also have to pay us the deposit money back which she is struggling to do and has not fully pay back years later 
so i passed a guy going mph in the left lane to get around him this jerk turns on his brights and starts tailgating me for about miles or so eventually he cuts in front of me and starts going mph again i get into the right lane and speed up the guy speeds up too this continues til we are both going about mph i think to myself whatever im going the speed i want to go then waze informs me there is a cop car up ahead i wait for a minute until i can see the cop i hit the gas which in my car revs my engine loudly but doesnt immediately cause a speed increase jerk hits the gas too and since his car is nicer than mine immediately speeds up to about mph i slow down to the speed limit mph is considered reckless driving in my state can you guess what happened next yup the statie turns his lights on and pulls jerkface mcgee over enjoy your reckless driving charge
hello ive recently graduated from college but have no job so i got an apartment at a shitty complex now just because its a crappy complex doesnt mean i shouldnt have a functioning apartment i do pay rent after all i had been on the landlords case for about a month to fix my slow drains and nonoperative electrical outlets in the apartment when my toilet clogged things came to a head i went down to the office to tell them about the toilet problem while i was there i also complained about the slow sink and outlets again they said it would be at least two weeks until someone would come fix my stuff when i asked why it was going to take so long they said it was because maintenance was too busy turning over apartments for new tenants that pissed me off pretty bad so i decided to relieve them of any new tenants maybe with no new tenants coming in they would have time to fix my apartment that i pay them good money for every month so i went to the drugstore and i got one of those poster kits it took me about fifteen minutes to make a poster that said in real big letters soandso is a deadbeat landlord then i took my sign and stood on the sidewalk in front of their leasing office i know i turned away at least people who were seriously thinking about renting there new tenants are so valuable to this company that theyll take off the rent of anyone who refers a new tenant i stood out there for one full business day the very next morning maintenance was banging down my door trying to fix shit for me apparently the way to get stuff done around here is by cutting off the flow of new suckers tldr landlord flatly told me that my shit wasnt getting fixed because they were too busy turning over apartments for new tenants so i stood outside their leasing office with a sign that said so and so is a deadbeat landlord and turned away all the new tenants that came up they quickly fixed my shit
im not sure of the outcome of my revenge but just doing it made me feel good inside and i lold at the thought from conception until weeks after i finished here goes one day a random guy starts callingtexting me saying dumb shit that doesnt make sense i hear laughter in the background after this happens a few times i start to get annoyed its obvious that its intentional and someone is fucking with me later that day he starts sending weird pictures videos most of which i would have rather not seen and ive seen some pretty sick shit this goes on every few hours for two days sometimes at night extremely annoying because i dont fuck with anyone and i definitely dont play phone games top three pet peeve of mine fucking cornball what to do i dont know the number so i duckduckgo it and find its a sprint number not voipgoogle after doing research on reverse lookups i decide against it im not about to pay money to find out whos calling me i also dont want to take the high route and just block the ive always been the bigger person but at this point im beyond annoyed and feeling super petty so fuck that i think for a while and decide instead to create a fake backpage ad offering sexual services for dirt cheap prices in biloxi ms chose it at random using this fuck boys as the contact i wait and post it around am in hopes that theyd get several calls from johns until or in the morning asking for top the callsweird messages stopped after that but i wasnt finished i continued this shit for a week posting ads in a different citystate each night to really fuck with him i would also post ads in this ts section and asked would be johns to send freak nasty dick pics asap in the post description as stated above not sure if all my hard work went unnoticed as they probably changed the number after day or and i never tried to call to make sure it was still active but just the thought of that asshole getting dozens of unsolicited callstexts for sex for a week straight made it worth it edit a few people have commented on how this wasnt pro level and i actually agree with them i initially tried to post this in rpettyrevenge yesterday but it would not take that being said this wasnt a breeze to pull off its actually harder than you think to post suspect content on craigslist backpage specifically craigslist thats the site i initially tried but their bots or mods would flag the post for deletion and have it removed within minutes after trying this a few times i switched to backpage also the circumstances surrounding my revenge are different from most from what i can see most submissions to this sub detail facetoface offenses like the guy on floor said a b c my sisterinlaw did x y z my boss was a dick you get it i didnt have that luxury only a phone number in this case theres not much revenge you can exact outside of petty spamharassment i wasnt about to spend weeks months planning this but trust when i say i lost my fair share of sleep plotting and carrying this thing out edit id also like to make this clear neither my revenge nor this post is a swipe at ts or prostitutes people have the right to lead whatever lifestyle they choose as long as their decisions arent hurting others we should respect them please dont use this post as an excuse to shit on others tldr random guy starts callingtexting saying stupid things and sending weird photos and videos for two days straight i make a fake backpage ad offering sexual services and put his as the contact asking johns to send nasty dick pics the calls stop but i continue posting ads for a week to really leave my mark i post several ads in the ts section as well
i took a comparative literature course my sophomore year of college and ended up with this english professor who had a very low opinion of teaching undergrad gen ed courses we were reading moby dick one of my favorite books and in classic nerd style i spent all quarter working on the paper i was very happy with how it turned out but when i got it back she had given me an f and had just written see me on it i went to see her and she said these ideas are too sophisticated for a college sophomore to have come up with it had to have been plagiarized i brought in all of my notes outlines previous drafts it was obviously my work she said find but it is still an f paper because it is terrible she gave me a chance to redeem my grade by rewriting it the paper was typed this was in the s no computers so i coped the paper word for word in blue ink and went back to her office hours she told me she could tell i had really worked on the paper and gave the paper a c then she sent me home to rewrite it again i recopied the paper word for word this time in black ink and brought it back and she begrudgingly gave me an a i have her a nice big smile thanked her for her time and then went right to the chair of the department with all of the papers long story short she was put on probation and had to have the chair sign off on her paper grades to ensure that she was being objective tldr english prof gave me different assessments for the same paper ended up being supervised for failing to grade objectively

when i worked in boston i used to take the commuter rail in there was a small lot that was not an mbta lot which abutted the pay per day lot that the mbta ran for years i parked in this small lot with several other regulars including the mbta conductors who all wanted to save per year one day i pull in to the lot and discover that there is a padlock on the gate which has been chained shut i see dave our regular conductor for the am just clicking the lock home and roll down my window and ask him hey dave what gives new policy only mbta employees can park here now the lot was small and when we regulars parked there some of the conductors and other sundry trainpeople had to pay i grumble and dig for change which is composed of nickels and dimes left over from fast food purchases quarters were for tolls on the way home i stop at a cvs in boston and pick up my own padlock i get to the lot and instead of rushing with the rest of the cattle to our cars i confidently walk over to the gate of the little free lot and place my lock to which only i have the keys on the chain the conductors dont get to their cars until after the turnaround and cursory clean up happens i live at the end of the line the next morning i see that the gate is wide open my lock has been bolt cut and is laying on the ground under a no longer used chain i park conductor dave is getting out of his car we exchange the nod and i walk with him to the platform other regulars are pulling in and getting out of their cars now along with the other mbta folks that are there in time to snag a free spot so what happened to the new policy i innocently ask dave too much trouble he says besides i think the laundromat actually owns the land and they got pissed and locked us in last night had to go find bolt cutters to get out do tell dave do tell for the next years that i worked in boston nary a problem total savings screwing the mbta priceless edit since it seems to be a point of contention the lot is an open dirt lot that it turns out actually was owned by the laundromat next door who didnt care who parked there the new policy was one that was implemented by the mbta employees informally and not one which was official this was not an employee lot and was as fair game to me and the other people who knew this as well as the mbta folks hope that clears things up
ok this goes wayy back when me and my friends were around or so we were quite a rowdy bunch not explicitly mean but we were generally lacking in the respect department we were visiting a festival and were camping just at the end of the camp area close to a forest now when we get back from a night of partying and wake up the next day we notice that lots of our suff has been stolen cell phones knifes axes clothes anything that looked remotely valuable they probably did it during night so they got what they could out of our tents in the dark that shit was not going to fly oh no we promptly postponed our hangovers and went on a hatedriven inspector cluseauesque rampage questioning everyone we thought even remotely suspicious as the camping was huge this went on for most of the day giving us nothing but new frienemies we then hypothesised as we were close to the forest that someone from outside had raided our tents we promptly went on to search the forest and found several campers trying their best to get a free festival we checked their tents as best we could without damaging anything after an hour or so of this suddenly in a man tent with the tenants out we spotted my friends axe though the fabric of the padlocked tent after that it went haywire we tore their tent apart arguably with thin evidence but then we found lots of our stolen stuff cell phones clothes yeah this was definitely them we proceeded to trash everything they had with them all the clothes sleeping bags afterwards we threw the remains up in the surrounding trees we found their keys tickets off the island where the festival was held and a cell phone which we of course trashed as such was the general atmosphere when in rome some astma medicine was found we decide not to trash that not out of the good of our heart but because we thought it more constructive to leave it whole pissed on well after looking around all their stuff torn to shreds and thrown all over the small grove the steam went out of us their former camp looked like godzilla had visited this was all fine and dandy but we felt something was lacking we wanted some personal time with the people living there they were a guy and a girl judging from the former clothes so we settled down made ourselves comfortable fetched our sleeping bags we even ordered pizzas and we waited now granted we were not very discrete we questioned everyone moving through the forest to their tents and were generally having a blast this led to our downfall a friend that was happening to watch the path into forest called me get the hell out cops are coming i was alone at the trashed camp at the time i promptly gathered up or stuff and went around the corner of some bushes where i met two police officers riding the biggest horses i have ever seen i just walked straight to and by them the horses just becoming bigger and bigger as the laws of geometrical perspective set in i still dont really know why they did not stop me i was probably looking guilty as fuck leaving that hbombed camp anyhow we never got that face time with the burglars we decided to give it a rest as the police now was involved and we had happened to do some things they might take offence at but we still and their keys and tickets to the main land we refunded two of our own tickets and used theirs instead as this way it became less traceable while on the hour boat ride back to mainland we went aft and threw the keys in the sea it felt good as their tickets had partially funded the gift of keys to the sea god tldr someone broke into our tents and stole most of value during a festival we found their camp and most of our gear trashed the rest except the asthma medicine which we pissed diligently on used their tickets back to main land and threw their keys in the sea
link to part of my story i must have deleted the original post oh well some of the commenters warned me that i dont get too in deep with this little past time of mine but i can not just rationalize the bad guy gal getting away with it and for how easy i am accomplishing this revenge this took about minutes of my day so after she went cold for a few months i assumed all was well the new dude she married found out her con via my anonymous facebook message and she split after he confronted her off and out of my reach forever fine by me turns out she ended up coming back to him along with a new facebook account new last name even an off the books job working for her husbands side business making arts and crafts cute i came across this on social media because it seems her whole family is now aware of this relationship and are in full support of their union i wouldnt mind that except for the fact that her family didnt give two shits about her when she was locked up the burden was on me to comfort her through visits and phone calls and moneyand most of all my time now if the burden never actually was on me and her family was helping her without my knowledge she was thus manipulating me and hid the truth of their involvement i feel more revenge is totally appropriate again on the other hand if her family wasnt helping her ever and it actually was just me alonewell that would kinda irk me now that they are suddenly all loving and supportive because she has her life back on track with of course a new husband providing everything to her since she cannot provide for herself still a fugitive and still flat broke where were they when i dealt with her incarceration and why are they enjoying the fruits of her new saviors labor knowing full and well she is doing the exact same thing she attempted to do to me and her other exhusbands no they cant have their daughter back like none of her exploits or past decisions ever happened and they especially cant have her back with me knowing they did nothing to help her ever so i paid to find out her husbands address online match pictures i found on a real estate website to his pictures on facebook verified it was his emailed the address to us marshalls who contacted her offending state who put me in contact with a parole recovery agent who then contacted local police in her new state who showed up at his apartment and took her to jail last time she got months for violating parole instagram pics drinking and she was escorting on the side this time for straight up fleeing who knows if they will give her more this time considering she bailed after barely a month once they released her for parole the second time you could argue this is unjustified revenge ive gone too far leave her alone now etc maybe i made up new justifications regarding her family and annoyed her husband didnt heed my warning so i had to do this again then again my second attempt at revenge flopped so this is my redo one thing is for sure shes still a criminal that hasnt once fulfilled her end of the bargain in the courts i assume she doesnt know someone is actually following her whereabouts considering how dumb she would be to broadcast her location on the internetor maybe shes fully aware of her spell she has on her husband and its only a matter of time before she goes back to prison she knows hell stay by her side because shes played that game once before so heres my story down up or side vote doesnt matter to me i didnt want to leave this story unfinished ill probably keep tabs on her if she returns to fugitive status again if not best of luck to her edit heres the origin post part if you care to start from the beginning 
this story is a bit out of character for this forum but i think youll enjoy it yevgeniy was a fairly well known russiansoviet poet and author during ww he was a front line war correspondent since this was the ussr there was no independent press and he was a full red army officer during barbarossa he was captured along with other soviet soldiers and officers in the uman the officers were separated from the regular soldiers and led into a school they were made to sit behind desks alexander edler von a german general came in to the room and delivered a long lecture to the captured soviet officers that the soviet union is conquered on the superiority of the reich and the futility of resistance the soviet officers were then sent to concentration camps the fact that dolmatovsky was a jew escaped the nazis and he was sent to a military camp he managed to escape and somehow rejoin the russian army several years passed and dolmatovsky found himself at the battle of stalingrad during operation uranus the soviets encircled the german th army which forced its surrender much of the th army command including fieldmarshal frederich paulus surrendered as well dolmatovsky found out that von daniels was among the captured generals he asked one of the soviet commanders rokassovskiy to arrange a meeting when the request was granted he put on a little play von daniels was marched into a schoolhouse and made to sit behind a desk dolmatovsky walked in and asked von daniels if he recognized him von daniels didnt he then reminded him of the uman pocket the schoolhouse there the little classroom packed with soviet officers and the little lecture on the superiority of the reich 
the story starts here the advent of the bitch now in addition to all the shit mentioned in the link above there was one thing the bq did to me that i still cant quite believe it happened because it was so petty and mean as i said in that post my health was and is fucking awful and the company got some pretty nice bonuses from the government as part of a program to try help people with disabilities get regular work yes my health is that bad at one point i managed to catch a cold that very quickly turned into a severe lung infection i was in the hospital for almost two weeks every day i andor my family and my government contact called the office to keep them up to date on what was happening and when they could expect me to return to work bq never answered the phones so about half the time my other coworkers took messages and the other half of the time we left messages on the answering machine bq never returned a single call we sent emails still nothing none of us heard a thing from her the entire time i was sick when i returned to work several days before the doctor had recommended i go back she told me she was going to take me to the board to have me fired for missing so much time without telling her naturally i was ropable but thankfully my other coworkers backed me up and the phone messages and emails were enough to prove my point and i got to keep the job until the end of my contract fast forward two years to this morning i knew bq had lost her job with the company not long after i left but i heard no more about it and gave no shits id gotten my revenge such as it was petty yes but like the pettyrevenge thread said i takes it where i can gets it this morning i got a call from a big local hotel bq put me on her resume as a reference i dont know how fucking desperate she was to put me on there but when the universe hands me vengeance on a silver platter i fucking take it i told them everything every poor decision every lie every rule broken every attempt to screw the people around her every single little unprofessional and dishonest thing i could think of and then i gave them the number of the company if they wanted more information i know that the industry here is utterly incestuous and this information will be at every decent hotel and motel in the city within the day and probably all over the state within a week she called me a couple hours later demanding to know why i gave her a bad reference dont use someone you tried to fuck over as a reference bitch
okay so this was a few years ago when i was in college i studied languages and it was required of me to spend an entire school year abroad either studying or working to get a feel for the language i decided to pick somewhere rural where nobody would speak english wanting to immerse myself fully and ended up being a farmhand in a tiny european village i lived in a little apartment next to the farmhouse and was supposed to live like part of the family emphasis on supposed to dont get me wrong the place was beautiful the work was interesing and a great workout and my boss was a decent guy it would have been pretty fun were it not for my bosss wife hoo boy where do we even begin with this ball of bitterness bit of background my bosss wife lets call her witch was a city girl one of those highflying businesswomen who got to travel and work with foreign branches manage major projects etc she was all high heels and designer bags and fancy brunches with her coworkers and then she married a farmer and moved to the arseend of her country to be a housewife by the time i came to work on the farm witch had two small children and had turned into the sourest most unpleasant woman i had ever met i learned later that she treated a lot of employees especially women the way she treated me but they were able to leave i wasnt witch treated me like dirt i was pretty much treated like a servant made to clean her house and look after her children on top of long work days on the farm she hated farm work and did nothing at all to help thisll be important later shed scream and swear at me and call me every name she could think of whenever her husband wasnt around to hear her and sneer in silence when he was i was terrified of her and there wasnt much i could do to fight back not only did she control my room and board but also my pay food supplies and the chance of a good review at the end of the school year i needed good references from my employer for my uni to accept me on the final year course and that witch knew it every time id try to talk to her husband or another farm hand shed blame it on cultural differences and then step up her game when they werent around i remember one week where her husband was away when i got sick with food poisoning and for the entire week she left me in my apartment alone to the point where i ran out of food honestly youd expect her to drag out the magic mirror and ask it whos the fairest of them all with the way she behaved so this hell goes on for a full nine months and theres next to nothing i can do about it i just figured id tough it out and go home then id never need to see her again but then witchs husband went away again and i got my chance for revenge it was literally my final day on the farm the afternoon before i flew back home i had to pack and clean up my apartment but shed ordered me away from all that to fix a window in one of our guest houses she liked setting petty chores to overload me then scream at me when it was impossible to finish them all so im hanging out the window two floors up when witch comes stomping down the path in her high heels and some fancy jacket and starts yelling up at me in her language she says that im to go to the goat shed right away because one of the goats is giving birth and her husband isnt there to help now wed lost two of the goats that winter so it was important that someone did it we couldnt afford to lose another goat or rather they couldnt afford to and thats where the revenge came in before hed left my boss had given me my final pay and written and signed a reccomendation for my college course i could answer any way i wanted and she couldnt do a damn thing no leverage left to hold over me so i smiled all nice and polite and yelled back down that i couldnt possibly come and help i still had so much to do and shed told me that this window needed fixing what if i left it unfinished and someone got hurt what if i couldnt clean my apartment in time after all shed told me to make it spotless for her before i left im so sorry witch but its just not possible i could already see her starting to panic and she started trying to argue about other people who could take my place doing these jobs her fatherinlaw sixty years old with a back problem her own mother untrained taking care of her kids for her even the cleaning lady that came in once a week lol what i had legit reasons for all of them until finally i said but cant you do it witch youve been living here for years i bet youve done this loads of times youll get it done no problem checkfuckingmate she couldnt back down from that and the alternative was not doing it and risking another dead goat and a pissed off husband she didnt have any leverage left over me and its not like she could drag me out of a second floor window so off she went the designated goat midwife it was twins she was there for three hours the last image i have of witch before i left for good is of her standing in the goat pen surrounded by the neighbours kids and a couple of tourists she was still in her high heels and nice clothes holding this slimy squirming baby goat out as far out in front of her as she could get it covered in blood and placental fluid and this thick yellow mucus the look of disgust and horror on her face still gives me the warm fuzzies karmas a bitch lady tldr bosss wife makes my life a misery while working abroad ruleslawyered my way into getting little miss fashionista covered in blood and placental fluid 
my father was a commercial fisherman before i was born he traveled the world originally from canada and worked away for months at a time as an aside one time while fishing a soviet sub surfaced behind them and it was one of the most frightening experiences of a lifetime for a fearless man anyway the boat and its crew were fishing off the coast of africa and every time they went out to their spot and were about to drop the netsthe engine would conk outafter the second time they hid a crew member in the engine room and found out the second in command was sabotaging the engine from what i remember the time for fishing was short and there was a pretty heavy level of competition and a lot at stake the saboteur was being paid by a rival fishing vessel so they could get the advantage so this may not sound like itbut it was a pretty big deal these people had a short amount of time to make a lot of money and the whole crew was away from their families for long stretches so what to do with this traitor their was talk of throwing him overboard but no one wanted to be brought up on charges of murder beating him was not really a punishment so they came up with this they took his id took all his money stripped him naked and left him on a beach in africa update so some people are asking for a follow up this is my first post so please be kind i am still learning well my dad is passed away now so i only have the details that he told me a long time ago the aftermath is up in the air i am pretty sure the saboteur was from canada or the us i dont know how he could have made it back without any id or anything that being said the world has a way of looking after you so some people probably gave him some clothes and then he probably could have made it to a consulate and maybe got a bunch of people to verify who he was via phonebut i am just speculating my dad said no one from the fishing crew ever heard from him againbut i doubt they would be in touch anywayso that doesnt really mean anything as for the soviet sub the time frame for all of this was probably late s early s the sub just came up fairly close right behind themthen observed the ship for about minutesthen submerged again to some it may not sound that scary but my father said it was unreal and he was genuinely freaked out they had no idea the subs intentions they were scared for about minutes after when they guessed that if something was going to happenit would have happened off topic but he did work for a mcdonalds supplier at one point and they fished for the fish that they used for filet o fish and he said never never never eat a filet o fish that is all i know

this is not mine i just read it and thought you would all love it 
take this entire story here with a bit of a raised eyebrow since it was told to me by a bunch of drunk old men telling me seventyyearold stories that have probably been embellished to hell and back but i cannot deny that the stories are entertaining as hell when you have a belly full of filipino malt liquor and goat cooked in coconut milk and chili peppers okay so i just got back from visiting family out in the boondocks the flat kind over the long holiday weekend i rarely go and visit family since we are so dysfunctional its not even funny but this time decided i needed to get out of manila for a couple of days while i was there some uncles and i got to sitting around with some beer churning up stories about my mothers father that i had never heard of my grandfather was the younger son and the second child in a family with five siblings his kuya older brother was already a lawyer when the second world war broke out and the japanese invaded the philippines grandpa was a young at the time farmer who helped his dad pay for basic necessities while his brother paid for the education of his three younger sisters the family wasnt poor but they werent sipping champagne either think lower middleclass on christmas day grandpas older brother shows up at the family house with a bag and a steamer trunk the bag is filled with paper money and silver coins and the trunks got some guns in it he had liquidated all his assets and purchased the guns where he could find them getting out of manila while he still could realizing the japanese were going to occupy the city life went on relatively unchanged for the next couple of months but the news was always grim the japanese occupied manila then swept through the flat plains of central luzon including my grandpas town the american forces caught in a pincer movement eventually retreated to bataan and corregidor and anyone even vaguely familiar with the pacific war during ww knows how that ended side note my uncles said that according to my grandpa and other oldsters the occupying japanese officers were unfailingly polite and very very scrupulous when interacting with filipinos the lower ranking soldiers however were a complete oneeighty my uncles insist that they were korean probably conscripted and that any atrocities ie random beatings rape etc that would happen would be at their hands im guessing that the officers would endorse their men and their actions after the fact because to do otherwise would make them seem weak anyway my grandpa and his brother begin resisting the japanese it was mostly information passed from one village or town to another but during the bataan death march they also sheltered at least one american soldier who fled east after escaping to put some distance between themselves and the japanese i took this with a grain of salt every single family within a hundred miles that survived ww has at least one story of sheltering a death march soldier it came to a head in late when another resistance group from a nearby village stole a truck with a load of gasoline or ammunition my uncles couldnt agree the japanese went house to house looking for the perps and they caught my grandpas brother in a well trying to hide some weapons after they pulled him up and they found the guns my granduncle was summarily executed by bayoneting my grandpa was very close to his kuya after a period of grief he went full on malevolent on the japanese including colluding with his neighbors to make ricefruitsugarcane wine and selling it cheap to the occupying garrison it wasnt large maybe men total preying on their already poor discipline and reducing them to drunkards they got so bad they were replaced by another unit grandpa introduced the new boys to the joys of drink too rinse and repeat japanese officers yelling at their troops became a common sight capturing rats and field mice and releasing them into the warehouses in the surrounding areas that the japanese commandeered to store their stolen rice aside from eating the stored rice the rats shit everywhere this pissed off the japanese to no end everybody knows never to fuck with an asians rice collecting shit from pretty much every single human who was willing to poo in a bucket for him mixing it with water to thin it down then fertilizing the trees around the japanese hq and barracks it would dry out fairly quickly in the heat so there was only a vague shitsmell but when it rained it turned into a fetid sludge that clung to everything especially the garrisoned troops and their vehicles apparently a couple of those trees are still around and they are huge and bear delicious delicious mangoes every year putting any and all handy chemicals into every single liquid the japanese were storing water oil gasoline you name it when he could get away with it he poured in everything from salt to soap to ammonia aka rancid piss stealing japanese supplies be it arms ammunition medication or whatever burying it then turning right around and snitching on himself he would tell the japanese officers that he had heard of a stockpile buried by a resistance group then go on and point out the cache he had buried a week or month or two earlier he fucked with those too when possible some but not all of the supplies were tampered with to look perfectly normal yet malfunction when used the japanese officers thought he was loyal to the empire and he got preferential treatment allowing him and his neighbors to cook up even more shenanigans when the americans finally invaded my grandpa at the ripe old age of and the resistance group he was with went on the offensive scouting out the path ahead of the americans and killing isolated japanese when they could according to my uncles my granpda never talked about this except to say that it was how he met his wife after the war grandpa did what he knew best he kept farming he was however smart enough to buy a couple of neighboring farms whose families had been killed by the japanese with nearly four times the arable land area from before the war he was able to continue his brothers work and put his sisters through school and that i think was the cherry on top of his revenge sundae my grandpa died fairly young s and after hearing these stories i regret that i didnt get to know my grandpa when i myself was a man preferably over beer
not my story my mom is a pharmacist and she constantly deals with addicts trying to get their fix this is a big busy pharmacy in brooklyn doing hundreds of prescriptions every day so you get all sorts the pharmacist is bound by a ton of laws and procedures this latest story started a week ago and just wrapped up last night a lady came in with a rx for oxycodone thats a pretty heavy drug thats on the controlled list and is pretty badly abused the corporate policy is that if the pharmacist has any suspicion that they inform the customer that the drug is out of stock and they will order it and it will come in a couple of days thats exactly what happened and the woman flipped the fuck out she screamed at my mom threw shit in the pharmacy and was escorted out by security after she called corporate to complain how horrible my mom was and tried to get her fired after this treatment my mom was pretty pissed off theres a database that pharmacists can access to look up certain controlled drugs that are prescribed to a particular customer this database showed that this woman was getting the same prescription for oxycodone from multiple doctors and trying to fill different prescriptions in different pharmacies because this lady didnt behave my mom went above and beyond and contacted all the prescribing doctors to let them know that this lady was tripledipping they all flipped out because what she did was very illegal and all dropped her as a patient all the other pharmacies that were filling her prescriptions blocked her as well if my mom was in a really bad mood she couldve contacted dea but she decided not to however were pretty certain that the doctors are obligated to do so if youre breaking the law dont be an asshole to people who can catch you 
this happened nearly ten years ago when i was a stupid college student i went to school in a state which has very liberal policies regarding medicinal marijuana the chief requirements are that you are a resident of the state and that you pay a small fee to a doctor in order to obtain your medical card for whatever ailment you like my two best friends who were also my dorm roommates and i availed ourselves this opportunity since it would allow us to have a fair amount of pot without legal penalty university policy wasnt as open minded but we didnt care since we were able to have a rather large quantity we occasionally helped the other residents in our dorm acquire what they wanted so they could avoid some of the unsavory characters attracted to this particular business one of the residents was dipshit ds and he often came by our room with his bosom buddy lil twitchy lt everyone who came by was treated as a friend and trusted to respect the community spirit of the residence hall one day after classes a friend and i returned to my room to partake and i discovered that the glass storage jar wasnt in its usual place thinking one of my roommates had maybe borrowed it i called them both neither had and at this point we began to worry im going to take this opportunity to introduce my roommates so bear with me first we have the grizzly a lbs alaskan native bearded mohawked with a liberal application of facial piercings next we have thunder lord lbs of pure angry muscle with a keen interest in rugby boxing and tattoos finally theres me im no chisled bronze warrior god but im fairly smart and i can hold my own in a tight spot as i sit in my room waiting for my friends to return im fiddling with my phone trying to think of someone anyone who might have a rational explanation for where our weed has gone then i notice a missed call from an unknown number placed the previous night around am when thunder and grizzly return i call this number and ds answers i ask him why he called and he says oh lt and i were hanging out last night and we wanted a little smoke i was calling to see if you guys were still awake when you didnt pick up i got some from tommy i hope i didnt wake you i reassure him that he didnt and get off the phone i relay the conversation to my now furious mates and we agree that something seems fishy we cant reach tommy so we walk down the hall and visit dss long suffering roommate who informs us that ds and lt were making liberal use of the colombian marching powder last night and were awake until all hours we decide to pay a visit to lt who is as his name suggests a twitchy little bastard as we walk up the lawn of his dorm who should we see but dipshit himself head down trying very hard not to be noticed we approach and surround the poor bastard and it is immediately obvious he is very stoned ds we seem to be missing some of our stash and weve heard you were wide awake last night any chance you might know where our jar walked off to i ask he stammers no man no way i told you tommy hooked me up last night alright ds thats fine thats fine but given the situation we would like to verify that can we see your phone just to make sure tommys number is in your call log around am at this point ds is sweating bullets but he says sorry i left my phone in lts room and i really gotta get to class on a hunch i slip away from him while thunder and grizzly continue to grill him and pull my phone out i redial the unknown number and seconds later dss pants begin to play music ds if youve left your phone behind whats ringing in your pocket why are you lying to us why dont you just come clean now and save us all a bunch of trouble and thus the floodgates open the tears and confession pour forth and ds tells that what remains of our stash is up in lts dorm room we escort him there and he knocks on the door when lt opens the door a wave of smoke billows out and he has a huge stoned smile as he greets ds when he sees us flanking his buddy that smile melts like a popsicle in hell we shove ds into the room and grizz locks the door behind us a beating of biblical proportions is about to commence and thats bad bad for the thieves and bad for us thinking fast i say alright you stupid fucks heres the deal you broke into our room and stole from us while we slept ballsy but stupid so im going to weigh what remains of my stash and you two morons are going to pay for what you smoked three times over once for grizz once for thunder and once for me its going to be a lot money so you have a month to get it all together in the meanwhile we are going to take this laptop this longboard and that xbox as collateral youll get it all back when you pay up you dont pay you dont get it back good the idiots look relieved and thunder and grizzly seem pleased so we collect the collateral and what remains of our stash and return triumphantly home the next day i awaken around pm with a scorching but victorious hangover because someone very very shrill is screaming at the top her lungs just outside the dorm building i walk downstairs to investigate and to my amazement a middle aged woman is rabidly berating ds just outside the dorm i eavesdrop with no small glee and hear you stupid stupid little shit your father and i have given you everything everything and this how you repay us in credit card bills and bank over draft fees what the actual fuck have you been doing here youve been at college months and you havent gone to class once this is finished right here right now i drove here alone but youre getting in the car with me and we are leaving apparently ds had burnt though his folks money and landed himself on academic suspension it seems his folks got the bills and a call from the registrars office on same day and his mom decided her little boy still had some growing up to do she was true to her word threw him in the car and that was the last we ever saw of ds all his belongings were left behind so we split the goods with his roommate and made out like bandits lt lasted a month or so more before apparently deciding that a liberal arts education wasnt for him and dropping out before leaving he paid us in full and we returned his things tldr step track down stolen pot step outsmart moronic thieves and restrain murderous roommates step moronic thieves dig their own metaphorical graves step profit wildly
just discovered this subreddit today i thought id share my story from kindergarten to th grade i went to an all girls catholic school i never met any boys before who werent blood related so when i transferred to regular public school in th grade i was culture shocked all the boys were so pervy they were flipping girls skirts and making rude comments i was the new girl amp the new target of the alpha bully lets call him tommy in th grade i was a small girl amp tommy was around inches taller than me and he was big like fat kid w some muscle big i couldnt stand his perverted comments he said things like i should come suck his dick and things like that the other girls said you get used to it but i just couldnt believe my little catholic ears we had this group project where he and i were grouped together i was assigned to bring materials and he said dont forget to bring lube and condoms and everyone in class laughed i felt so embarrassed i know this doesnt sound like a big deal but to year old me it was i couldnt take it anymore i dont know what came over me i took apart one of my spiral notebooks walked up to tommy amp his friends and slashed tommys face with the wire from my notebook he fell to the ground he was on his knees amp hands i elbow his spine i think this is a wrestling move i dont know the name hes on his stomach with a bloody face i was about to kick him in the face but he was crying already so i came to my senses and walked away the slash left a scar on his forehead amp he never made an obscene comment towards any of the girls again edit im now amp i saw him on the train once scar still there we nodded at each other amp i guess all is forgiven edit i dont understand why when a man posts a prorevenge about ass kicking he gets a youre awesome bro but when a little girl does it its like youre a terrible person this bully was sexually harassing all the girls in my grade do you guys have any idea what its like to be a young girl amp being told youre gonna get fucked in the ass later tonight no you dont well maybe some do i guess i just flipped out because i was sexually touched by my tennis coach in nd grade but thats another story sorry for pissing everyone off with my post edit after remembering this story i looked up tommy on facebook amp hes a teacher now woah lol edit i didnt mention it before since i didnt think this post would get a lot of attention but i should mention it now to justify my actions he wasnt just sexually harassing me amp girls with his words but he liked groping us too slapping our butts grabbing our boobs barging into the girls restroom etc there was even one instance he jerked off in the girls bathroom and it reinforced other boys to do these things as well all the girls didnt want to stand up to him so i felt like i had to do it to get him to stop so yeah if i went to juvenile hall back then i wouldnt even plead not guilty or deny it but he deserves juvi time too edit oh my god my first reddit gold d thank you so much ill treasure this moment forever 
as a naturally thin woman i have had my share of being called everything under the sun from string bean to tampon string most of it doesnt phase me but every once in awhile if you catch me in the wrong mood i might go off on someone for harshing my mellow this particular day i had walked into a local watering hole with a swimming pool on premise and i wore what i considered to be proper attire for this venue shorts and a tee with a bathing suit underneath just so we are clear on the subject most women on any given day requiring the use of a bathing suit are already battling body conscious demons without the aid of perfect strangers beligerently hurling unsolicited advice as it happens sometimes the days events are going to have their own agenda i just wanted to meet some friends and blow off steam that day as i walked by a man whose body type resembles a beached whale i can hear him snickering with his cronies pointing at me and exclaiming things like that chick needs to eat a cheeseburger i started to stop dead in my tracks and do an about face but i changelled my inner lloyd christmas from dumb amp dumber and instead calmly proceeded to the bartender i smiled and gave her my order a drink a shot and a cheeseburger later im feeling pretty satisfied appetite and liquidcouragewise i then turned over to the sea cow that had been calling me names and i gave him a polite wave a bucket of beers later im pretty sure he is now second guessing that perhaps we have met somewhere and surely thinks i am flirting i smile sweetly at the bartender and i hand her a generous tip for what would have been my entire check when that portly gentleman right over there offered to pick up my tab and i smile and wave again just as le douche is motioning for me to come over and the bartender catches a glimpse of a hand gesture and assumes he is confirming his offer to take care of the check she smiles takes my tip wishes me a nice day and im off but not without first ordering a side salad to be sent to my new friend the sea cow along with a hand written note in a folded up napkin that states i too know how to suggest food that seems consistent with body mass
after reading for hours of peoples brilliant revenge i felt compelled to share my singular moment of glory to set the stage heres a little background back in high school i was more of a nerd than not but i also had a diverse group of friends so i had an in with most of the cliques and those that i didnt necessarily agree with were usually far enough removed that i never had any problems with them directly however the few that i silently resented were public enemies of a sort anyway there was this one kid a year my senior lets call him cockus the ball master or cm for short for the better part of my first three years i see cm around and am generally left with a sour taste its the usual bullshit calling people out for whatever reason then taking it out on professors who try to intervene there were a few runins with the law in cms short and illustrious career as professional douchebag too but again nothing that directly involved me that is until spring semester of the th grade one day when we were packing up from an orchestra rehearsal both percussionists we happened to be in the same band this semester it was a split campus school and he went to the other one but a few classes were only taught at one and students were shuttled between them good ole ball master accidentally left his ipod on a chair which we later learned well come monday morning hes on a warpath cm accuses one of my good friends of stealing it who i knew well enough to put my own reputation for his character and then i was also accused of theft a fly on the wall no more i say fuck this kid and his shit im not going down for lies a halfassed investigation gets opened by the school but about two days later someone thinks to check with the custodial staff and sure enough one of the janitors picked it up over the weekend and put it in the lost and found after that incident cm kept a little distance from me and my friend but there was a colder sense of animosity towards us as though we had accused him of the theft not the other way around by the end of the year i hadnt had an opportunity to take revenge on cockus for what he did to us and to dozens of others which included destruction of personal property vandalism and a lot of the petty shit it seemed that my chances were slipping away but then a good old deus ex machina came our way and he got held back another year jackpot karma came around and gave him a swift kick up the arse but it was also right into our laps the revenge flash forward to spring semester of our senior year im taking a biology class and its another one of the shared ones guess whos there our mate cockus the ball master although he doesnt acknowledge our prior standing i sure as hell do forgive and forget i try and live by but sometimes life just doesnt want that to happen so fuck him to quickly set the stage this biology room like most of the building was constructed back in the s and hadnt seen many renovations since the s when a few additions were built all the lab tables were that indestructible black synthetic rock stuff each shaped like a pentagon where one side joined it to the wall each of those sides held a row of drawers individually keyed as well as two more columns of drawers on the walls between the island pods there were somewhere around of them in the room making for a metric shittonne of drawers around of them in total for the most part we used the front of the classroom but occasionally we went to the back to dissect cats and shit one lab i opened one of the drawers out of curiosity but it was empty turns out they all were and hadnt been used for quite some time what a waste what an opportunity a few days later i stumbled across an old ass box filled with verdigris brass keys i just had to know each one was paired with an identical key on an old spiral ring and each one went to one of the two hundred odd drawers and thats where the plot was hatched over the course of about two months with the help of another one of my quietly unsuspecting yet marvellously devious friends we began mapping out where all the keys went our professor was one of the best i ever had and being a class at the end of the day usually we would have some time where he would answer questions and help people with whatever and the rest of us could do whatever work we needed to get done that meant a few minutes every day where we could slip away to the lab tables and look like we were doing homework unsupervised when we finally had all the keys paired to their locks we took half a dozen or so each day and progressively locked them in different drawers so if you had one key you would have to find the drawer it opened and there would be another key inside which opened a different drawer which had another key you get the idea but because there were two keys we could keep the key for the last drawer on hand and open it whenever we wanted to but the other was locked away in one of the drawers and also since there were two we unpaired them and ever fifty drawers or so we put a mountain of the previously used keys in it sort of like a congratulations fuck you two weeks after we started we locked the last key away leaving us with the one for the final drawer and one for the first drawer for good measure we made the final drawer on the top so you couldnt somehow jimmy the ones above it open and reach your hand down by now it was drawing near the end of the semester and so we waited for our opportunity to give cm the petty shitstorm of a lifetime and our chance came at the best possible time two days before the end of the term cockus left the room for something and also left that fucking ipod on his desk when the opportunity arose i casually lifted it and some other douchey personal effects into the last drawer they went i had been ready for this moment for months and looking at the inconspicuously horrifically devious sabotage made me so happy i could sing no one wants that of course cm doesnt notice that the ipod is gone again and leaves for the day come the last day of classes i drop an envelope on his desk when everyone is packing their final things for the year inside was the first key and a note scrawled the words want to play a game this was the height of when saw was becoming popular and come cryptic shit about what he had to do to get his things back if i could have taken a photograph of his face when he realized what happened i would need nothing more out of life of course i didnt stick around to see if he ever made it to the last drawer but no one would help poor cockus the ball master my only regret is that i could not have done it sooner fuck that guy tldr a jackass at my old senior high accused me of theft so i stole his shit and locked it in a room with two hundred keys edit changed the name of ole cockus the ball master because im not here to offend people just tell a story
my dad is an extremely organized guy he has to have everything in order at all times however every once in a while he forgets stupid shit in the late s my dad owned a beautiful black truck he spent a lot of time and money making it look great one day my mom and dad go out to dinner but decide to take my mothers white jeep instead of my fathers truck originally they were going to take the truck but figured it would be fun to take the jeep out with the top down this is where my dad messes up he already had the trucks keys in his hand and while helping my mother take the top down he left them resting on the back bumper he immediately forgot he put them there and they drive off without a second thought so now my dads car keys are in the middle of the street in front of our house a man is walking around the neighborhood and spots them on the ground he then starts to click the unlock button to see if the car is anywhere near him my dads truck lights flash and the man decides to take a joy ride the asshole speeds into a field and proceeds to drive as fast as he can throwing all of my dads cds and personal belongings out the window including my dads wallet this guy absolutely destroys the car tons of huge dents scratches and the bottom of it is covered in mud sticks and grass at this point my mom and dad arrive home and freak out because they are short one car in the driveway my dad immediately remembers the keys he left on the bumper and gets pissed at himself he wonders if the guy who took his car would be dumb enough to ride it around their neighborhood so he takes the jeep and starts looking sure as shit my dad finds the dumbass minutes later cruising down a street by theyre house my dad passes in front of him and slows down to a stop gets out of the jeep walks up to the guy who now has the window rolled down wondering whats going on and punches him square in the face my dad is not a very violent man but seeing the condition his car was in mad him see red my dad then holds the guy back with his arm and calls the police telling them he caught the guy who stole his car the man is arrested and pays for damages to the car and all of the shit he threw out of the window dad says the truck never quite ran the same but it was still great to catch the douchbag in his car please excuse my spelling and grammar errors this was done on my phone
story starts out when i was i was years old and moved from the great outdoors of canada down south to the hot weather of texas my dad was a manager of an oil refinery and he got a better position as a whole sector manager i was and i was about in second or third grade give or take i wasnt informed of me moving until one day my mom went to school with me and checked me out i had a couple good friends and a lot of family in canada that i had to leave after going on the plane the first time ever i was so ecastic my mother said i passed out so when we came to texas we had a big house in canada we had a apartment in the city in texas we had a nice grand big house with a front yard bed rooms i was so happy that i almost forgot i had school next week and had no friends for anyone who has seen king of the hill imagine the houses being lined up all the neighbors were really close our neighbor was a cop and he had an year old son named johnathan johnathan and i became best friends and when school started after summer he showed me around and helped me a lot though johnathan told me to stay away from a boy named ken ken was the school bully he would just go around and bully kids because he wanted to i was about at the time i was short ken was a whopping ken basically had inches on me and pounds i was super scrawny compared to ken first day i got to school i had one of the best teachers i ever had growing up her name was miss maddy miss maddy was about years old though real nice she would stay after school help students give students bus money if they needed it it turned out ken and i were both in miss maddys class on the first day of school i didnt know who ken was though i saw some tall kid in a black shirt and i made eye contact with him he turned and snapped saying what the fuck do you want retard i never heard those words ever in my life and i remember these words like yesterday they are scarred into my head so the year went on and in february is where the bullying started happening i was on the swing set and ken just came and pushed me off i fell into the sand face first he and his buddies were laughing his buddied tagged along with him because they were mostly scared of him i came home and told my dad my dad told my principal though the principal turned out to be kens fathers motherinlaw ofcourse she would not get ken into troublethe principal simply told my dad no evidence equals no proof my dad was furious and he had a teacher meeting arranged with miss maddy and miss maddy said she will keep an eye out so the bullying happened everyday johnathan witnessed and helped me push off ken one time now johnathan got himself into this well i almost forgot johnathans dad was a cop i went to johnathans dad one time while he was working on his beautiful red ford mustang i explained to him and explained that the princiapl wont do anything and such and such i told him johnathan is also on kens target list basically mr white johnathans dad told me that i should set up a sting well i didnt know what that was so he explained to me and i followed mr white told me that he and his partner and child services would be looking through an identified car and if they see me getting harassed they will come and arrest ken for excessive bullying harassment assault etc so i explaiend to johnathan and johnthan and i made a plan and told mr white what was going to happen the next day i saw ken walking up to me and johnathan so we both quickly ran past him while saying something outloud the phrase we said was meet me at the back alley of corner street ill trade you the shiny pokemon card pokemon cards in the school went for quite a bit of money i knew ken wanted that card and would do anything to get his hands on it so i had the card and johnathan and i met up at corner street at pm guess who comes a long at ken and his buddies basically they walked up and one of his buddies said hey give me the card and no one gets hurt we saw a white pick up pull up and just quietly turn off their engines no one noticed not even johnathan i said no this is my card youve been bullying me all year screw off he replied to me give me the card or i will break your arm i said no with a smirk on my face ken ran up with his buddies and head butting me mr white his partner and a child services worker jump out of the car and rush to the scene they put handcuffs on ken and his buddies and sit them down at the curb while their parents came kens buddies started crying saying that he made them do it and they just kept crying mr white wasnt going to arrest them he was going to scare them so they will never bully again then ken started crying saying how hes sorry and he will never bully again they bring in a squad car load them up and take them to juvi mr white told me this after it happened in juvi they put them in a holding cell scaring the living shit out of them ken and all his buddies were crying for forgiveness then mr white led them theyre still handcuffed around juvi and showing them what kinds of kids are there and if they wanted to join them they started crying again then all their parents came picked them up the principal was put under investigation for allowing students to get bullied and ken moved places kens buddies then in middle school and high school became straight a students and were friendly with everyone one of them even came out as gay moral of the story dont bully my friends and i tldr kids bullied me they got handcuffed and started crying never bullying anyone again
years ago i worked at a plussized womens clothing store in a bad part of town the store was part of a national chain and its clothing was designed for the younger crowd our store was not part of a mall but was part of a strip mall that sat right up against some low income housing i really enjoyed working there because i got to help people shop i also enjoyed helping plussized girls feel beautiful my pay was barely above minimum wage but my husband works in it and he makes enough money to keep us comfortable there were a few things i didnt like about my company for one they made us sell magazine subscriptions at the register that were basically a scam its cents a year now but youll be charged an inflated rate next year for a renewal i felt bad because i knew many of my customers were low income and probably wouldnt remember to cancel the other thing we were required to do is aggressively push our store credit card i wasnt good at pushing the magazines or the credit cards and it was no secret that our regional manager was not pleased with my performance despite having amazing sales numbers because my magazine and credit applications were low i was treated poorly by my store manager gina and the regional manager rick out of all of the associates i was the only one that had trouble getting magazine subscribers and credit applicants i later discovered that one of the associates had a boyfriend that was also a drug dealer he would give his drug customers a discount in exchange for their personal information and social security numbers so his girlfriend could run their info on credit applications this associate was best friends with our store manager gina this girl shared all of this information with all of the associates except for me i later heard that i was resented because i was a rich white bitch another crappy part of working at this store was dealing with shoplifters even though the citys police station was across the street from our store people would come in and try to pull a fast one on us if we knew someone was shoplifting one of the associates would start a conversation with a shoplifter while the other associate went in the back room to call the police our store had no antitheft systems and it had no security cameras because our amount of shrink was so high our store was put on probation and we regularly had a company come in and take inventory of our merchandise we knew how much our store was losing every three months corporate sent down some head honchos from loss prevention that would interview us one at a time and try to figure out if one of the staff was stealing the man they sent was named jack jack gave me his name and cell number and told me i could call him if i noticed or suspected any of my coworkers was stealing on one of the days that our merchandise was going to be inventoried the regional manager rick arrived this was odd because rick lived in the neighboring state somewhere he must have left his home at am to be there when we opened rick spent the day manipulating the inventory results he would do things like make the people taking inventory scan empty shoeboxes and inventory shirts twice i went home and wrote down everything that i remembered on july rd i received a text from gina she wanted to know if i had set aside a particular shirt to purchase for myself she sent a picture of the shirt i told her it was not mine the following day i noticed gina had posted pictures of herself at a july th barbecue wearing the shirt when i got to work the following day i checked the inventory no associates made any purchases at all that week that shirt was never sold in any size at our store but one was missing from the racks gina had stolen it i went home and i created a powerpoint presentation with screenshots of my text messages with gina about the shirt details from our inventory and pictures from ginas facebook page showing she had the shirt i also provided the details of the credit card application scams my coworkers were running i sent this off to jack the loss prevention guy at corporate and waited within an hour my phone lit up jack told me i would be transferred to any store i chose for coming forward and i was rewarded with a gift card he told me they knew about the credit card applications being fake because the same people were applying over and over again i knew that no matter what store i chose rick would still be my boss so i told jack i would think about it when i got to work the following day rick and jack were there gina and her best friend were fired and were already gone within one fucking week i was being written up for not having enough credit apps i quit right then and there i went home and called jack and told him about ricks inventory manipulations i gave a tip about our magazine program to a major consumer publication and they published stuff about it on their website this chain used to have locations in our state now it has two i just looked on linkedin and rick still works for the company oh well i feel like i got revenge edit i just wanted to add that the story was written by my wife and i posted it up here i guess this is a huge deal because all of my other posts point to the fact that im a dude and the fact that a couple can do things together on reddit is too much to fathom

my grandfather had been a soldier boxer police officer and eventually became a farmer shortly after my father was born were from a small community in canada where everyone knows everyone and having a person bully others just isnt okay my grandfathers farm was quite large acres upon acres of potatoes and grain over laying hens and a sizable herd of pigs but as all farmers at the time were the local bank owned much of the farm one year was a particularly rough year for them disease had spread through the pig barn and the entire herd was lost this was devastating as it was their most valuable source of income my grandfather had made arrangements with the bank that the grain harvest which normally fed the pigs would be sold to make payments on the loans to the bank the banker was great with this the problem arose when a new loan officer moved to the community and took over my grandfathers account he demanded payment much earlier than what had been previously agreed the revenge started with my grandfather inviting the banker out to the farm to discuss terms they were walking through the completely empty pig barn this was the type of barn where the manure from the pigs would flow out of the stalls into a trough and down to the end of the barn filling a massive pit because of all of the recent rain in the area and the lack of use of the barn the water had filled this pit and a nice layer of straw dust had settled over the entire thing this caused two things first the concrete walkways were only raised about an inch over the manure filled water and secondly unless you knew where you were going or looking down intently it was easy to step off of said walk way well the meeting wasnt going well they were walking through the barn to the end of the row and my grandfather wasnt too pleased they were walking with the banker in front my grandfather behind him and my father taking up the rear as they came to the end of the row the deep pit of manure was in front of them my father saw that the banker was about to walk straight off of the path so he reached out to grab the banker when out of nowhere my grandfather slapped his hand back and watched as the banker stepped off of the end in his suit and right up to his neck in pig manure they grabbed a rope to help the poor guy out but wouldnt let him in the house to wash off at all he ended up hosing himself off in the barnyard and driving back to town smelling like a million bucks needless to say the grain harvest came in a few weeks later and as originally agreed on my grandfather made the payments

so back in high school aged i realised i was gay but i hadnt told anyone at school what i was doing though was hooking up with guys using faceparty old school right my account never had my real name on and only one picture so to find it you really had to know what you were looking for or you were looking for other gay people so the asshat of the school finds my profile some how and starts immediately telling everyone that im gay and he found my profile etc so i started getting questions about it all day long after the first few i started ask the question my profile is pretty private how did he find it without searching for gay guys thus putting the seeds of doubt in place that night when i get home i mocked up a faceparty profile for this guy used his email his pictures one his usernames from msn and a little sob story about being closeted and not wanting to be found out then screen shotted the profile and printed off a lot of copies took them into school the next morning and got one onto every desk in his home room and several pinned around the school it was confirmed the guy searching for gay guys was actually gay and had a secret gay account guy went absolutely off it everyone thought he was gay for weeks best part was after about weeks of everyone taunting him and loving me he tried to take a swing at me i nutted him and fell to the floor and thus sealed his legacy as the guy who was outsmarted and then beaten up by the gay guy of the school

 i just found this short story on the csgotrade subreddit in a thread where someone was asking for advice on how to deal with a scammer when i was still in school grade i forgot my pencil case in the lobby once and someone took most of the stuff out of it then cut stripes into it with my scissors everything that was left were my scissors which heshe broke apart and some trash of some rare candy inside the case and someone wrote alexander speier a guy in my grade on the pencil case but the first and second name were clearly written by different people so my only chances to find out who did this was the name on the pencil case the candy trash or to find a person who was using the stuff i had in my pencil case after school i decided to go through the rooms that were being used by my grade because i thought i might find some of my stuff i ended up finding the empty candy box which was the source of the trash in my pencil case under one of the tables and i ended up finding out that one of the three people at who were sitting at the table was also named alexander i figured out that one of his friends wrote his name on my pencil case while they were having their fun with it and he quickly completed the name with the second name of some other guy and thats why the names were written by different people his handwriting matched the writing of the second name speier and i saw him playing with the neodymium magnets i had in my pencil case i now had options either take my revenge or go to the principle and try to get my stuff back because the stuff in my case was only worth about me and a friend of mine started to plan revenge i waited about year so that he doesnt get too suspicious at first we stole his pencil case i got my neodymium magnets back and kept waiting weeks later i also stole his new pencil case i was now sitting on two of his pencil cases i took all the stuff out and threw most of it away nobody could track it all back to me i then slashed the cases the same way he did with mine i also bought the same candy as he did and put the trash into the pencil cases and i wrote alexander speier on the two pencil cases in printwriting i placed some of my poop in a small plastic bag and placed it in one of the cases and put packs of stink bombs vials each pack in the second one i knew that he always left his bag unattended before going to computer class in the break between the th and th hour i put the pencil cases into his bag stepped on it to burst the bag with my shit in it and to break the stinky bomb vials or at least most of them i didnt really care if all were broken while my friend kept watch we then got back into the building after the break with the other people to see his reaction years later i still sometimes feel a little happy when i remember his face and his tears by the way he had to throw everything away because he couldnt get the smell of the stinky bombs out of his leather bag it cost me a lot of work and for the stinky bombs but it was worth every minute and every euro
this is from a couple of years ago leaving work and walking towards my car i notice the pressure in one of the tires is pretty low i drive to the closest gas station and pull up to the air compressor it was so i put in three quarters and nothing happens so i walk inside wait patiently for the cashier to finish ringing up a customer and then tell her i think the air compressor is broken i put in and nothing happened she looked at me and said yeah youll have to go somewhere else i was a bit taken aback so it probably took me a second to say uh well dont you think you should put up a sign or something and could i get my quarters back so i can go to another gas station i want to stress that my tone was was perfectly polite so i wasnt prepared for how quickly her attitude turned from unfriendly to nasty when she said youre gonna have to eat it if shed said sorry only a manager can do that or something along those lines i probably just wouldve left and forgotten about it but i didnt like how she was treating me i kept my cool and with very slightly strained politeness said is there a manager or something who can help i dont have any other change and my tire is really low nobody else anthonys the manager hes not here hell be here in the morning alright i said thank you the next morning i call the store and the lady who answers sounds like the same cashier i ask for anthony he left before six hes getting married today gonna be on his honeymoon for two weeks oh i was there yesterday and i was told hed be in this morning well anyway i had a problem yesterday afternoon the air pump stole my change i remember you so it was the same lady i told you to come before no one else gonna get your quarters for you i started to disagree but realized i wasnt going to get anywhere so i said okay thanks anyway and hung up the gas station was a franchise of a large brand so i wrote a quick email to their customer service address the next morning i get a phone call from the regional manager at the franchisee which turned out to be a company which owned quite a few gas stations in the area he apologized for my experience said theyve been having trouble with this store and asked me to describe the cashier which i did and he said hed look into the matter further he also wanted to reimburse me the i told him i was just happy he was taking the matter seriously and that i didnt really care about the money but he mailed me a dollar and a couple of free car washes anyway so that was nice i hadnt expected to hear anything else but i was very surprised a few days later when the same manager called me again just to tell me that mrs nasty attitude had been fired for a string of issues including mine as well as accepting bad checks i felt bad for about half a second but she was mean lied and provided terrible customer service apparently serially

i was incredibly boring in high school honors ap lead in orchestra journalist in school paper you know the type my parents raised me not to question authority just shut up and do what youre told then i suffered for two years with my french teacher and totally lost it i took french because i loved the language and genuinely wanted to learn it most of the students in my class were that way since spanish and german were said to be easier and more fun there were a few class clowns but no worse than in any other classes this woman jesus this woman she had no business being a teacher it was no secret that she hated males especially nonwhite males the class believes this was at least in part due to the fact that her daughter got knocked up by a black guy and thus named her granddaughter a very ghettofabulous name we knew this because she frequently babysat her granddaughter and would take her to school forcing us to entertain her shed forego the lesson and instead do something that her granddaughter would like to do like play games this wasnt really a problem because who wouldnt prefer to goof off the issue was that wed still be tested on the material she failed to cover that day as if it were our problem that she had to babysit that day ridiculous on days she wasnt babysitting shed also answer her phone in the middle of class and talk to her daughter and make plans for the weekend at one point the study guides were being ripped out of the french books presumably for cheating purposes she outright accused our class of doing it when one student chimed in and asked why it couldnt be one of her other classes she told us we were the only class that would do something like this wow way to falsely accuse a class of vandalism she was quite a bully and verbally abused students in front of the entire class her biggest pet peeves included coughing and yawning should a student yawn or cough shed become irate and tell them how rude it is even if they covered their mouth after a good minutes of public abuse shed send them out of the classroom to deal with them later and would subsequently either leave the door open while yelling at them outside or simply forget about them she left one student outside in the rain for nearly the entire minute class period and then when reminded couldnt recall why she sent him out there in the first place one time she sent the two class clowns outside together for disrupting the class apparently one of them let out a fart so rancid that the other puked on the asphalt when the teacher went outside to talk to them she got angry at this for some bizarre reason and forced the one that puked to clean it up with a dixie cup the bell rang and class let out in the middle of this and she forced him to stay and continue cleaning it up much to his humiliation when the class clown keeps his blushed head down and doesnt have any jokes to throw back at the people teasing him you know the punishment went too far anyways this lady was a waste of teaching space so i decided to type up an anonymous letter saying so i bulletpointed everything she does that is more disruptive to the class than the class clowns ever could be i told her that she is depriving us of an education i requested that the class environment change and that she stop publicly berating students and discipline them privately i was firm yet polite in telling her that if nothing changes i will be going to the principal this is still my teacher and she deserves a chance however i stopped caring about respect when she spent the entire class period the next day yelling at the whole class insulting me to everyone without even knowing it was me i was a coward rude disrespectful i should teach the class myself i dont know what im talking about no one agrees with me shes a fantastic teacher shes not racist or sexist etc etc she shared my private letter with the class and said some pretty humiliating things about this ghost writer screw this woman i gave her two months to change things around they got exponentially worse so i did what i threatened to do wrote another anonymous letter to the principal i explained everything and pleaded for help she wasnt in class the next day and i guess there wasnt even time for a sub to be called because a security guard sat in on the class i was the only one that knew why we had a sub for the rest of the week and everyone was making speculation as to why shes been gone for so long some even happily joked that she died or has cancer i sat quietly just waiting for the outcome the next week she returns to class with a somewhat different attitude and announces to the class that she has been offered early retirement and she is going to take it holy shit i just got my french teacher fired bitch totally deserved it last day of class party period teacher couldnt care less about the class or the school since shes gotten the can one of my classmates sitting near me brought up the letter wondering if thats what got her fired yep it did how are you so sure they asked because i wrote it stupid ohhhhhhhhhh shit the quiet girl got the teacher fired the next year in french everybody freaking loved me i was suddenly ms popular in one class the one that saved us and got a new teacher the teacher hired for the next year was the sub we had for that week the teacher was getting fired and she knew she told me i hope i can do better than ms teacher because i dont want the same thing to happen to me
in order to keep a long story short i wont go into full detail but heres some backstory i moved in to a new basement apartment with two girl friends from school the landlords lived upstairs with family within the first week we had been experiencing harassment not only from the landlord but the landlords family as well we were being harassed weekly it had gotten so bad that we had called the cops on them numerous times they refused to perform basic repairs in our unit they came around screaming and swearing in our faces over petty stuff because it was their house and they felt invincible little do they know that i know my rights and am not afraid to stand up for myself eventually we got a notice that they were trying to evict us this notice included all the things we supposedly did to them they accused us of assaulting them housing an illegal grow op none of us smoke in the slightest destroying city property and luring them in to our unit to harass and assault them well after this all happened i went in to super research mode in which i tried to dig up as many of my rights as possible to use against them when it came time i found out that in my city you must possess a rental license in order to legally rent a part of your home i then found out that particular house did not possess one they had been skirting fees and laws for years and they couldnt obtain a license due to safety and zoning issues i found out that if the city were to find out the landlords could be faced with a large fine and we would be evicted what did we have to lose they were trying to evict us anyway so i called the city and alerted them to the illegal rental unit the landlords were running fast forward a few weeks to our trial date turns out the landlords wanted to settle out of trial because someone had informed the city of their rental unit and they could not obtain a proper license if the city were to evict us the landlords would be in violation of the tenancy agreement and we would have won our case and then some we settled on termination of our lease and our deposit was to be returned to us oh and they can also never rent that apartment again because it is not legal to do so tldr landlords harassed us from the get go they made our lives hell for the time we rented turns out a bit of research for clarification revealed a city bylaw and the landlords are forced to cease renting indefinitely 
ever since i was a little girl i was always excessively bullied mostly it was because of the fact that i had a male body im a transgender woman but it took me years to figure that out so for the time that i was in public school i was just a very effeminate male bodied kid obviously that tends to draw the wrong kind of attention with ease and ended up being one of the main reasons that i was bullied for several years there was this one bully in particular though who throughout several years would never let up lets call him shane most bullies would eventually stop after bullying me after awhile because they got bored this all happened in detroit public schools so the staff there usually didnt care or thought the bullying of a effeminate male bodied person was justified to beat the queer out of me as some called it shane was part of a small core group though that continued to stick around and make my life hell for several years for years his bullying was most of the standard physical violence and name calling around fifth grade though his bullying changed a bit and got weird he still did the standard bully practices but after awhile he started sexually harassing me to this day my theory is that he is a closeted gay man everyday he would at least feel me up inappropriately grabbing my butt feeling up my chest or crotch and say weird things like youd probably enjoy this because youre a faggot and that was just the daily minimum everyday id come crying to the principle or other adults asking for help and theyd ignore me and tell me to stop complaining and on a few instances i was told it was my fault no matter what i did no one would help me fast forward again to seventh grade shane is still pulling this shit on an almost daily basis to the point where i have become numb to it but i still feel rage towards him and i plotted everyday on how i would end his life finally my day came we had a new gym teacher lets call him nace come in who was not from around the area and you could tell because he was bright cheery delightful and wouldnt let students get away with anything because the horrible city hadnt gotten to him yet he had also just recently got his degree so he was fairly new to teaching and fairly hopeful of what he would accomplish i knew that this guy would be the key to finally bringing shane down the problem was finding the perfect time to strike one day shane made a bad move while we were in the locker rooms changing he brought along some of his buddies and trapped me in a part of the locker room and proceeded to call me degrading and bigoted insults while taking photos of me changing i knew this was the time to strike we had some dusty ass gym floors because the janitors never really cleaned up the gym so i got some on my fingers and rubbed it really hard into my eyes so id start tearing up all over the place and i went over crying to nace and told him what happened his jaw dropped to the floor and he immediately ran over to shane and dragged him into his office later nace pulled me into his office and told me what he did he confiscated his phone and found the pics on it the immediately sent the kid home and phoned the police at this point i was freaking out because i didnt want to go and testify against the guy in court i was afraid hed find a way to make my life worse but nace told me not to worry and that hed take care of it several months later nace pulled me into his office again and told me the whole story that he went to court for me and told the people there that he had to confiscate shanes phone and that he immediately phoned the police after he found the photos on the phone and that shane got thrown away for possession of child pornography but they went a bit easier on him since he was a kid himself fast forward to a few months ago i no longer live in detroit im now off in a nice quiet city going to college and getting my degree in it i went back to detroit though to visit some people and shock a few people with my recent transformations because i love the dumb look people give me when they see me as the happy woman i am now while i was in a store getting some snacks for a night of counter strike with an old friend of mine i ran into shane at the store i recognized him but he didnt recognize me lets face it though not a lot of old people i know recognize me now i was happy to see that it looked like his life was going nowhere he looked like shit bought his snacks with foodstamps and has a house arrest ankle bracelet on i left that store with a bag full of tasty treats and the best feeling in the world knowing that everything in my life was now awesome and his life was in the gutter tldr possibly super closeted gay man bullies and sexually harasses me for most of grade school and some of middle school takes nude pictures of me on his phone i then use that to put him away for awhile i run into him again a few months ago he doesnt recognize me but i recognize him and i become deeply satisfied when i learn his life is now shit and my life is going pretty awesome 
i meant to share this story some time ago but it slipped away from me until i remembered today its a shame to keep it to myself although it is a little sad in places but i hope you can enjoy it about a year ago around this time my mother was approaching her last days she had lived a hard life and it caught up with her all too quickly she didnt have much left to her name but she made sure i had possession of her car it was an absolute wreck despite having a good engine and i knew it would never sell but it was all she had to give not long after she had passed away i was contacted by the welfare type agency she had been getting support from they said my mothers spouse or dependents were entitled to sum of money to help pay for final arrangements i was happy to hear this as i had had to pay for the funeral by myself and the expense had really hurt me however they didnt want to give the money to me i was a year outside their range for dependents instead since my parents had divorced an eternity ago they wanted to give the money to my younger sister my deadbeat sister who had run out on my mother while she was ill stolen from her to buy drugs and only showed up at her death bed to scream at her they told me the money would go to her or it would vanish i was torn over what to do but remembered that my sister had recently had her car impounded with cold certainty i knew what i needed to do i gave them my sisters contact info and had my father get in touch with my sister i would sell her the car for the majority of what they were giving her which was honestly not a terrible deal she tried to haggle but she needed a car too badly a week later fighting against her wanting to meet up at every shady place imaginable we meet up in a public spot and made the exchange i had a friend with me at the time for backup and he could do nothing but stare goggle eyed at the events that took place its easiest if i lay them out like this she had blown her portion of the money on a fair amount of meth and was stoned out of her mind after taking the car from me she learned that its tank was on fumes she tried to argue and the three creepy dudes she had with her wanted to make a scene but they couldnt do a thing while we stood in a crowded supermarket parking lot as they drove off i informed my friend that i had been unable to find the title for the vehicle and that it was still registered under my mothers name and was most certainly not in the glove box of that car additionally my sister has an expired license and has a warrant out for her arrest due to evading parole i very nearly dialed the non emergency line to report the car as stolen after this i should have considering she was driving it while fucked up and could have killed someone but my father had begged me to give her a chance either way it ended up with the same result a week later the car was found abandoned and was impounded just like her previous car she was picked up as well and learned that she was going to real prison this time instead of a short stint in a youth correction center shes still there now and will be for the next several years i may not have put her there myself but i unloaded a burden onto her and got what should have rightfully gone to me back first 
throwaway for obvious reasons about a month ago one of my friends came over to hang out we were having a good time but he looked nervous to the point that it was killing me i had to ask what was bothering him and that was where my life got turned around he showed me a facebook post from my upstairs neighbor we live in an apartment that stated that she was going to break into my apartment and break the living shit out of all our electronics because were too loud one of the major complaints i have about this apartment complex is that the walls between apartments on the same level are like steel my neighbors can be throwing a party and i would have no idea however the ceiling is paper thin and you can hear conversations verbatim ive lived in dorm rooms that have the same type of material surrounding the room ceiling floor and walls im used to it however my neighbors have way too high of expectations living in an apartment complex when we first moved in they constantly commented on hearing our conversations and how they know what tv shows we watched at first it was kind of laughable but the comments turned into complaints my husband told the male neighbor his friend that theres nothing he can do about it at all except move out this is out of the equation since we are waiting for our house to be build new construction and we refuse to break a lease to move to another apartment for a few months only to move into our house up until last month we havent heard too much the facebook post was absolutely shocking and i was pissed if this woman publicly threatened my property what else would she be capable of doing i confronted the situation and told her to take down the post she said some nasty things to me and i told her that my request was simple you should not go to social media to deal with your issues and you need to direct your concern to the person directly involved anyway my husbands aunt is a lawyer she provides us help with legal situations if necessary and has been a big help for some of our other relatives over christmas break i was talking to her about the situation and explained how i didnt feel safe this woman has a history of drug abuse and violence that i dont trust in addition im currently weeks pregnant and want to protect myself and the baby my lawyer then pointed out that because of my profession as a public official this threat and any future aggression toward me is a class felony in my state that would result in years in prison if convicted i was absolutely shocked that i would qualify under that laws specific protection and my lawyer suggested that she would write a letter detailing possible legal action if this woman decides to do anything against me the letter was delivered today i heard a lot of holy shit from upstairs and im guessing that she called her husband to complain about me im sitting downstairs dealing with my life after all im battling morning sickness times a day and will be responsible for a life soon edit i also feel horrible that the husband of the upstairs neighbor is one of my husbands friends i know that you can choose your friends but cant choose their significant others i think the general hatred toward us was not expected by my husband and he is hurt that someone would allow their so to do the to their friend
my kid sister was friends with the neighbor girl lets call her biana biana was a total bitch with a very rankoriented view of the neighborhood she had a seething hatred for me i was out playing in the yard and went to talk to my sister i round the bushes and discovered biana was with her and i had dared approach without permission from the bitch queen i dont know why i decided to continue walking over to talk to my sister as i was a fragile kid and her friend was constantly chipping away at me she eventually interrupted us cuntbeast youre annoying me im okay with it cuntbeast leave me i live here cuntbeast if you dont leave i am going to kick you in the shin me you are wearing roller skates even you arent that mean well it turns out she was that mean i took that roller skate right to the right shin my sister and the dragon just walked away the next day i answer the front door and it was biana cuntbeast oh its you is my sister home me i dont know closes front door cuntbeast you could at least check i searched my sister if for no other reason than to get the dragon off of my porch and in checking her room found her mysizebarbie she was too lazy to put the dress back on her after she wore it but must have felt bad about leaving it naked as it was wearing her underwear her underwear with a huge skidmark on it i had a plan i could scare the shit out of biana and embarrass my kid sister for leaving me there after the bitch kicked me i went to my mothers room with the giant doll which was over the front door of the house climbed out the window onto the roof of the porch and threw the doll to the sidewalk behind biana screaming mentaluproar dont the doll hit the ground the arm broke off and flew a few feet away biana screamed a gradea horror movie scream and my sister rounded the corner seeing her soiled crippled doll paralyze her seemingly fearless friend with terror biana actually thought i threw my sister off the roof she never bothered me again first post be gentle

about years ago my girlfriends friend had just graduated from university she had managed to land a very high paying job in the private sector she would constantly brag about how she was making soooo much money and how she had an expensive car she would tell all her friends they need to get their asses in gear so everyone could be like her this girl was the definition of bitch fast forward about years she has now landed a new higher paying job with the government after being with them for about a year she hurts her back and is on longterm disability for months and there is no sign of her going back to work anytime soon you would think that someone with an injured back would not do a lot of physical activity like skiing partying at the bars etc she had a desk job and everyone knew she was faking the best part about all this she was posting pictures and adding comments on facebook about all the fun she was having after months of observing this i did some research and tracked down the name of the insurance company that handles government workers i filed an anonymous complaint and thought nothing would happen about a year later i found out she had been sued by the government for over in claimed wages while she was on disability she tried to fight it in court but the insurance company had hired a private investigator and tracked her every move they had screen grabs of her facebook statuses as well as photos taken by the investigator from his car of her doing recreation activities proving her back was ok she lost the fight and had to pay the k she lost her job went bankrupt and had to move back in with her parents she is currently a year old unemployed single woman living in an isolated rural area with her parents edit i love the idea from bellewhether about sending her the card unfortunately she still doesnt know i did it and no one else does so i cant send the card however an anonymous ecard might work thanks for the suggestions even my girlfriend who is now my wife doesnt know
this all went down about years ago me and my then wife were married for about years at that point she came from a very conservative christian family her parents never liked me because i wasnt religious and im a democrat they tried their best to convince her not to marry me but to no avail looking back i wish they had convinced her to not marry me at some point during the marriage my wife began to withdraw sexually we went from having sex times a week to times a month to once a month she told me that she didnt really like having sex that much and that she did it mostly to please me what i didnt know was that she didnt want to have that much sex with me because she was getting her dick elsewhere how did i find out well my wife was using my laptop her laptop was being repaired and accidentally clicked the remember me box on her email i went to check my email and it redirected to hers i saw every message she sent to this guy and basically confirmed that she was cheating on me like any sane person who realizes their marriage is over i filed for divorce also i alerted the other mans gf and she promptly dumped him now like i stated before her parents never really liked me when they found out i was divorcing her they went ballistic apparently she lied to them and said that i cheated on her i kept getting hateful emails from them every other week after our divorce was final i told her parents that she cheated on me and sent them proof her dad emailed me saying he was sorry and that hes disappointed in his daughter all i replied with was well now you know what kind of person your daughter is never contact me again neither of them have contacted me since about a year after our divorce i get a long email from my ex with the subject as thanks i thought it would be some sort of thank you letter but it was far from that some of it read like this thanks for making my parents hate me thanks for driving me to cheat on you thanks for ruining my life that was the last i ever heard of her her parents disowned her and she was the shame of the small town she came from according to facebook she now lives in australia but considering she hasnt posted anything in years i might be wrong also remember the gf of the guy my wife was cheating on me with that woman is now my fiancee iwin tldr wife cheats on me her parents disown her and im engaged to the other man ex gf win 
one of my previous offices was on the top floor of a building that had retail shops on the ground floor and the building was part of an outdoor mall the primary shopping clientele were upper class attractive white women and their spoiled kids i worked for a tech startup and i rode my harley to work we only had reserved spots for our company of which meant most of us had to park wayyyyyy out in the back of the mall parking lot after lunch since i rode a motorcycle i started just using the motorcycle parking that was about yards from the elevator rather than the fullsize parking spots that i wouldve had to use if i drove a car one day i return from lunch to find a fullsize buick suv parked perpendicular across motorcycle spots which are very clearly marked and the front half of the truck is extending into the back half of a spot thats meant for a car to be parallel parked against the curb the front door was positioned so that when the driver got out of her suv she would have been standing on painting that said motorcycle parking only so being the kind of person that hates entitlement i proceeded to roll my bike right up against the suv so that the driver wouldnt be able to get in using the drivers door and probably wouldnt be able to leave without knocking my bike over or moving it since i had about minutes left in my lunch break i sat down on a bench under a tree across the street and just read articles on my phone after about minutes a woman comes up to the suv with teenage girls between the of them id wager they had the iq of a flea and had worked a cumulative days in their lives she walks around the truck from the passenger side and just stops dead when she sees my bike she calls the girls over and they all share the same omg i cant even expression i walk over to my bike make sure my forks are locked really just an excuse to make my presence known and turn to walk away she asks me if i can move and i look at my watch and say sorry im on my lunch break and im outta time gotta run and start walking away she yells how am i supposed to get out and i respond with dont know shouldve thought about that before parking in motorcycle parking and keep walking she threatened to move my bike so i stopped turned and told her ive already got a picture of your license plate if my bike has a single scratch when i get out of work tonight ill just contact your insurance company the look on her face was incredible but the giggles from her presumably daughter and her friend were even better apparently they liked seeing someone treat mom like she treats people i walked back to my office which conveniently overlooked the motorcycle parking and called my coworkers over to watch the scene unfold after a bit she flagged down security who were clueless and of no help to her she made some phone calls id imagine she called hubby for a solution eventually she resorted to climbing in from the passenger side which was funny to watch mainly because it was futile once she was in the drivers seat the full gravity of the situation sank in because she had wedged herself into a space that wasnt a proper parking spot the compact car in front of her and the curb behind her meant she was stuck like chuck until this point id consumed about minutes of her day id already gotten back to work after about the minute mark but was casually surveying the scene at some point around an hour in the car in front of her left which gave her enough room to leave the satisfaction was so good that the whole charade became something of a routine for me although she was the only one i was able to confront apparently my antics earned me a reputation with mall security also not only did they start actually monitoring the situation and telling assholes not to park there but they also tried to give me a lecture one evening about how im causing problems i reminded them that since i wasnt an employee of the mall or any of its tenants they had authority over me and if they were actually doing their job i wouldnt have to be causing problems and the lecture ended pretty quick tldr dont park in motorcycle spots with your giant soccer mom suv
this dear reddit is is a story of justice a tale of evil clients and knights in shining qa departments ampnbsp the setting our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but dont want to manage a database to sit behind it the heroes i work as a lowly qa tech in a qa department of about ive been working in this place for about years now and im frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients they trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if theres anything i want to ask about my boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of how to earn respect the guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics great boss my good friend who well call greg works as a fairly senior member of the customer support department gregs got my back and ive got his if he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then ill help him out the villain the clients project manager who well imaginatively call douche was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered when paired together these things often mean that bad things will happen to make things worse this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it after all he is a paying customer the pledge the client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom api which we expose on our soap interface it was a good feature and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off all my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails one exchange with douche on this topic went thus gtme hi douche its derp at ltcompanygt just calling abou gtdouche oh hi yeah the slacker at ltcompanygt hows it going it should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call hence why this was obviously my fault gtme biting my tongue im im ok thanks just calling about your requirements on the api which you sent throu gtdouche oh this again havent you finished that yet gtme well no youll remember that weve delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which youve been infor gtdouche oh for the love of why is it taking so long gtme thats what i wanted to ask about requirement says its supposed to calculate x but lower down it states the maths you want it to use the problem is that this equation doesnt actually represent that val gtdouche look youre supposed to follow the specification ive written so just do it i dont want to hear about this again until its done the next day my boss tells me that douche complained about me to his account manager saying that i was being offensive and was questioning his competency he can read minds i then completed this piece of work ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction the turn after the best part of months and the client is about to go live with their site theyve been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full months before they were even able to test it and at this point they were going live in days because thats when their marketing campaign said it would because of these tight deadlines they signed it off in our acceptance testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete i had all but forgotten that previous conversation with douche about pm friday afternoon greg from cs calls me up says hes got an issue with douche greg now knows first hand how douchy douche can be this is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system any issues they had integrating were not development issues but customer support issues i make my way over to cs land and this is where things get fun gtme sup greg sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features gtgreg hey derpyou ever worked on this new api that went up for ltclientnamegt gtme yeah i did the verification process on it what do you want to know gtgreg the client seems to think it doesnt work gtme it was implemented to the letter plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out havent they gtgreg yeah thats what i thought when i read the documentation ok leave it with me and ill let douche know i head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation i have on this feature because i know exactly whats coming next after not too long steve the account manager for douche storms into qa and straight into boss office theres a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually im called in gtsteve would you care to explain this steve points at an email on boss screen i go in for a closer inspection and its an email from douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the api has obviously not been tested at all im surprised steve believes this because he knows me and ive worked on various projects for him in the past gtme i was firmly told my mr douche that i was to implement it to the specification gtsteve but the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense it doesnt make sense gtboss derp what did the specification say about this gtme i can grab the documentation from my desk if you like gtboss i think that would be a good idea i go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me wanting to know whats going on on the way back i see boss trying to calm steve down gtme here it is i slide it across the desk and take a seat steve and boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to steve turns a little pale and boss smiles gtsteve but that makes no sense gtme i know gtsteve why didnt you raise this with the client gtme i did i then was accused of insulting the clients project manager and calling him incompetent gtboss who wrote this specification gtme douche over on their side did im pretty sure you two would have been ccd on the email when it came across gtsteve well what are we going to do we have to fix this before they go live on sunday its now friday afternoon gtboss no chance we only release new code on monday or tuesday unless its a priority issue even then this is an api that multiple clients are now using and well have to be careful not to break their integrations gtme steve you might want to look at section on that document steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered that and ive made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past gtsteve ok wait there steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission the client wrote the requirements signed off the requirements signed off the work in acceptance testing and have only hours before they launch they will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight the prestige its and i am considering what ill spend my weekend doing boss walks out of his office and comes over to me gtboss can you just join me on a conference call gtme if its quick gtboss thats up to you really intrigued i follow him into his office where i can hear a much more humble sounding douche on the phone explaining to steve what needs to be done gtboss steve i have derp here do you want to explain what the plan is gtsteve derp we really need to get this sorted you worked on the original feature so youll know the best way to test this were still working on getting someone to develop the change but well be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for sunday we reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients gtdouche i really need you to help me out here mate otherwise itll really hit the fan over here i pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice gtme ive already made plans for this weekend and gtdouche derp seriously you have to help me out here gtme i dont really feel like it gtdouche well someone needs to fix this gtboss its pm on a friday most staff are on their way home or out the door sorry steve but it looks like itll have to wait until next week douche rages down the phone and once this torrent of abuse subsides steve lets me go back to my desk im packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings gtme ltcompanygt derp spea gtdouche please i need you to do this gtme you need to sort this out and calling me wont help you gtdouche please im sorry just help me out gtme you have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever weve spoken your failure to listen to me is the sole reason youre here right now i did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way i am not helping you gtdouche please hes actually crying you can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky so i hang up and leave for my weekend the end monday rolls around and steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client whos organising the fix to the api gtsteve so derp this is herp another project manager for ltclientnamegt gtme is douche not working on this project gtherp douche no longer works here tldr douche pm for client writes spec for api sproc logic makes no sense pm thinks hes infallible qa tech questions logic gets reported for being insulting client doesnt test the api signs it off anyway it hits the fan release date is ruined pm is in deep and pleads for help qa tech hangs up and enjoys weekend even more
sorry for the triple posts everyone i knew this would be a terribly long post so i broke it up to make it slightly easier to read but here is everything in post part betrayal and planning this is a long one but it made me feel oh so good in my high school there was a counselor who just didnt like me well to put it more accurately he didnt like my family his daughter and my eldest sister had been academic rivals their senior year and my sister won a statewide award over the counselors daughter it didnt help that my second sister actively pissed this guy off by ignoring him and going over his head for things she was the sbp and went out of her way to not involve him in things which set me up for a bad time when it comes to this dude in th gradeyear i think is equivalent i tried for a dollar scholarship that came with a brand new laptop i got teachers staff and coaches to be my references wrote an essay and sent everything in three days before the deadline i get a phone call from the company offering the scholarship one of my references hasnt sent in their letter lets have a show of hands of the times a company offering a scholarship calls someone to make sure they get their stuff in i get on the phone to the one guy i know messed up and sure enough he forgot to mail it out wait patiently for the results to be announced and when they do im not one of the winners i didnt even win of the minor scholarships that were for my school the kids who did win all of them very smart people were called out of class by counselor scumbag specifically because he wanted them to apply for the scholarship to put this in perspective there students in my grade that everyone agreed were the smart kids i was one of them and i didnt get an invite i shrugged the loss off i really just wanted the laptop anyway fast forward half a year im taking a foreign exchangestudent to the homecoming the girls host family was one of my reference a nice teacher who works with the juvenile delinquents and is the adviser of the honor society i worked with him in honor society the girl needs a few more minutes to finish getting ready so i sit in the living room with the teacher and shoot the bull about school he steers the conversation towards this scholarship i missed out on i say that that was just tough luck he gives me a confused look and says so you dont know what happened i ask him to elaborate and he tells me a tale about a week after the deadline for the scholarship ended he receives a phone call from the scholarship company the lady on the phone was very confused as to how the teacher could have written such a nice reference letter for a troubled and dangerous student like me the teacher says that i am one of the best students hes ever worked with a bit sappy but his words not mine he then asks how the lady came to think i was such a terrible person ltcue suspenseful musicgt this lady had called the school to ask about the applicants to the scholarship from our school the first person who she talked to was counselor scumbag he said of the applicants were star students and never got in trouble he claimed the last one me was a troublemaker and a terrible student he had on several occasions had to speak to me about my actions in class i would be a terrible candidate for the scholarship due to my aggressive and dangerous behavior now im a little bias but i had only spoken to this counselor a handful of times mostly it was hello counselor im not trying to make this juicier or more revenge worthy i just never spoke to this guy when it wasnt absolutely necessary this counselor a person who was suppose to be there to help students just straight up character assassinated me so that i had no chance to win the scholarship after the dance which was lovely and the foreign student thoroughly enjoyed i began to think about this information this counselor didnt like me and obviously would offer no help when i started to look at colleges id have to do it myself and this revelation gave me an idea the counselor was notorious about scholarship amounts he love to brag about how much a class was offered in scholarships he even had a ceremony at the end of the school year to announce the cumulative amount a student got and where they had accepted to attend college he even let the top earners say a few words in thanks for those who helped them i resolved then and there that that would be the hour of my revenge i would earn more scholarships that anyone else in my class forcing the counselor to let me speak in front of my class and the faculty i would blast this scumbag for the jerk move he pulled and let everyone know i got those scholarships by myself and with no help of our benevolent counselor part am i suppose to be impressed now that i had decided to get revenge from this counselor i needed to get to work on getting the scholarships since i pulled a on my act i was able to apply to schools early and bypass the stupid paytoapply process that many universities have i worked to improve my resume as best i could my grades were around a gpa because i wasnt interested in school so i drove home the extracurricular activities i got more involved in sports joined the scholastic bowlquiz bowl team ran for student government and did both onstage and behind the scenes theatre i never got elected to student government but my teachers always nominated me for class rep it gave me the unique opportunity to study my prey up close counselor scumbag had a system if you were a family friend or lived in his neighborhood you got preferential treatment not noticeably so if you didnt look for it but it was in everything he did soandso got a scholarship that wasnt advertised throughout the school despite of the school being eligible awards were given to certain people despite being on equal or lesser footing than other students this is how i found out the reason only people applied for the scholarship when i was in th grade it was never publicly announced in the school i didnt notice since my family found the scholarship online small things like this should not have happened this counselor claimed that he would help everyone get into college if they would come to him but he kept the best scholarships and opportunities away from the majority of the school by the end of my junior year i had applied to universities around the us in the next months i had another applications sent out by the time school was starting up for my senior year i was winding down on schools that i wanted to apply to i thought it would be a good time to move ahead with my plan i walked into counselor scumbags office one day and asked him if there were any scholarships he knew of that i could apply for he had spoken with a friend of mine one of the other people who were dubbed the smart kids scumbag gave this guy a stack of applications to fill out about inches thick every major university for miles was covered as well as many private scholarships from companies what does scumbag give me scholarships neither of which i could ever qualify for thanks to genetics i was neither female nor hispanic i thanked him anyway and said i would apply to both over the next months i received letters of acceptance from of the schools never heard back from the other in total i had be offered over years with from a single school some may say im privilege that i have nothing to complain about they maybe right or the years spent working construction with my dad may have put the fear of hard labor in me either way i had done it that amount surpassed any single students cumulative scholarships by about i was pretty proud and then i get a note from the office asking to meet with counselor scumbag i had written up a word document that listed all scholarships with amounts and schools and brought it to school that day to show some teachers that i used as references i chuckled to myself as the fates had decided to shine on me that afternoon when i got down to his office i asked what he needed scumbag said he had two things for me first was that he needed a list of all scholarships i had been offered for his presentation at the end of the year second was the wonderful news i had received a a year scholarship to school on my list he said i should be proud of such an accomplishment i laughed in his face isnt even a piss in the bucket i slide the list across his desk to him that is my list in scholarships offered from different universities including the one he looks the sheet a couple of times reading it in earnest some of those schools were nearly miles away im not sure if it never occurred to him that students wouldnt want to go to school within a days drive of home he sits back in his chair takes a deep breath in through his nose and says am i suppose to be impressed this is where i made my mistake i had played my hand too early but i didnt realize it i told him that i had earned more than anyone ever had at our school and that i was looking forward to his presentation i picked up my bag and walked out feeling like a king scumbag sat at his desk with his fingers pressed together in front of him i was on my way to a perfect revenge oh was i ever so wrong part an unexpected result a month had past since my encounter with counselor scumbag word had gotten around that i had earned some serious scholarships but i kept it a secret so to have that big gasp moment scumbag had not made contact with me and i was fine with that i was winning i had done what others had thought improbable earning over a half a million dollars in scholarships was nothing to scoff at with the ceremony a week away i was assured of my victory and absolute revenge let this be a lesson for everyone never trust the system to play fair the first sign of danger was that with only a week left no one had been notified about speaking at the ceremony i kept checking with the smart kids to see if they had been approached but nothing then the hammer fell the ceremony would be changed this year in an effort to save time we will not be having the students speak at the ceremony since they already do this at graduation we will still present the letters of acceptance to students who were accepted to a local university that was all the announcement said i can still remember it now because it caused such a pit to fall in my stomach i had the slimy bastard and he changed the rules in years of him being head counselor the top earning students had spoken at the ceremony and time the ceremony was never longer than an hour so what were they conserving it for something had to be up i swung by the front office to talk to the secretary i had been an office aide for her in the past it helped to figure out scumbags system and she knew most of the gossip around the school this time she too was clueless and couldnt figure out why a man so set in his ways would suddenly change the ceremony just a week before it occurred as i walked back to class i saw him out of the corner of my eye he had just finished speaking with another counselor he glanced my way did a slight double take and smirked i stopped and glared back if there ever was a point in my educational career that i wanted to punch a faculty member that was it this man had used this ceremony for his purposes for years i had seen him read off scholarships amounting to to one student and to the next this wasnt about making sure peoples feelings werent hurt he didnt care that a student had put his time and effort into gaining more than anyone thought he could this man wanted nothing more than to control his system i had to force myself to walk away if any of you think im being harsh or bias its possible these are the events seen through my eyes but a little bit down ill explain more so hold on the day of the ceremony arrives my family goes and gets good seats near the aisle happy faces are all around me but i cant help but feel a little displeased this was to be the stage of my grand revenge i sighed and thought that he would at least have to announce my scholarship of to a university halfway across the country counselor scumbag gets up and begins with his usual droll about how wonderful the class was through the years he subtly hints that he had a hand in guiding these brilliant upstarts towards a brighter tomorrow the usual sappy sludge dished out at events like these scumbag begins to give out the awards first to the students going to the local universities then moves on the the students who have earned their nursing licenses through the hosa club health organizations student apprenticship or something like that and finally he gets down to me arcval has accepted a scholarship to awesome university if you waiting for more thats it after putting in hundreds of hours or applying writing getting references and visiting campuses i get arcval has accepted a scholarship to awesome university i cant say anything my family is shocked that he didnt say the amount of the scholarship and that he said it almost in a hushed whisper i just bite my lower lip and stare dead ahead defeated humiliated and ashamed not much more he can do to me now you cant tell but i honestly had to stop writing for a minute i still get upset just thinking about it the only thought that came to my mind was to confront him after the ceremony was done i had to know why he changed everything just because i beat his system so i did i waited for the crowd of thankful students and parents to disperse when it was just him and me on the stage i asked why he looked at me and said because you dont deserve it i look at him for a second and say well its a good thing you dont get to decide everything then is it in that one sentence he had brought back a memory that i had of my freshman year my sister was the student body president and she wanted to have a celebration at lunch for the end of a term most everyone was on board with the idea but counselor scumbag wouldnt aid it he was one of the advisors to the student government and had to give his permission before any funds could be spent when asked why he said you dont deserve it my sister being a hothead gave him some choice words to think about and went to the principle and got the celebration approved that was what i had been missing i wanted to prove the system wrong when i should have ignored the system the principal was like a really good father hed eat in the cafeteria with students and even join in the basketball games at lunch however you knew he would come down on you if you broke the rules i went to his office the next day and laid out my story just as i have done for you he gave me many of the arguments i alluded in my side notes after asking him to just confront the counselor about it he said arcval i care about you but this isnt enough to go off of i stood up turned to walk out and said over my shoulder if you cared about me as much as you said you do you would do something about this i walked out and went to first period minutes late now i cant vouch for this part i only got this through hearsay and the secondhand telling by the principals daughter but here goes the principal thinks about what i told him for a bit i had been in his office a few times but never for anything bad true there were measures in place for bad students before they got to the principals office however no bad kid had volunteered to be the mascot for the homecoming parade no bad kid had broken up a fight between sophomore girls no bad kid would have earned in scholarships something was wrong what i wouldnt give to be a fly on the wall in counselor scumbags office for those minutes the words were never told to me but it was a verbal beat down that should have been remembered the principal walked in and wanted to know why a kid who had earned rd of the entire classs scholarships money wise hadnt been recognized as he should have after much backtracking and confronting the truth came out scumbag didnt think i should get the recognition the principal told scumbag that if he tried anything like this again he would have him removed from office union contract said you couldnt fire him but you could put him on administrative leave the things you learn at the water cooler a few days later after this has been circulated around the school a few times the principal stops me in the hallway and says everything is taken care of i thank him and hurry off to class thinking that is the end of it classes finally end and graduation night rolls around were lucky enough that the weather cleared up and we get to walk on our football field the principal gets up to give his sappy congratulations to the class despite a few misfits a joke about his daughter being one of them to liven it up a bit he then congratulates our class on being the nd highest earning class when it came to scholarships over million dollars were offered then he says this million is a remarkable feat however there is a greater one the measure of a student is how far they are willing to go when faced with adversity while some influences in the world push these students down this class pushed back and none exemplify this determination better than arcval his efforts alone have earned him in scholarships a feat he did by himself without aid lets give him a cheer for his intelligence and determination not sure if it was tears or a bit of cotton in the air but my eyes were misty at that point it wasnt what i expected and im sure its not what you the reader wanted i would have loved to have the knee jerking gotcha moment with that counselor but i didnt get it instead i got the recognition for hard work and determination if its any consolation my little sister was a freshman at this time the next year that counselor offered here a chance to attend a leadership minicamp in our state capitol he also started posting every scholarship available on a board for everyone to look at the principal looks in on him from time to time to keep him honest but i think he has wised up to the fact that he should help everyone not just his chosen few and thats it thats my tale of grand revenge i planned out a huge revenge party just to slip up near the end and ruin it take from this what you will but i got something better than revenge closure closure and the knowledge that my efforts may have helped someone down the road get a better scholarship thanks for reading and sorry about the parts mess

tldr at the bottom of the page this is also a throwaway name as i dont care for it to be associated with my regular forum posting i cant tell if im a bad person or not i mulled it over but i may be blinded by my own sense of justice because i am the batman woman whatever i was living in phoenix and working at a restaurant while going to college one of my managers offered to come over and assist in a school project i was stuck on i lived alone and was a bit naive but still allowed him in when he came over much later and had been drinking with other coworkers without lots of details he drugged and sexually assaulted me the next day he lied about it at work but he then phoned the restaurant repeatedly while he was out of town and not only admitted to it but gloated in the fact that i was good and its a pity i didnt remember oh yeah he was also in his early thirties married and had a child i didnt phone the police because i was scared and remembered bits and pieces i understand how women can be treated in rape cases and i chose to not pursue it i quit that job and moved about six months later after becoming ill in what i can only assume is some kind of ptsd nervous break down heres the revenge part i found him on facebook he still lives in phoenix i found his wifes facebook i found his address i created a fake profile and wrote his wife who was pictured with daddy and three children and told her every bit that happened it was nothing graphic as i was sincerely not trying to hurt her but there was definitely enough detail that she would know its true ive never heard back from her but i know she has seen it she has since moved to another city in phoenix from what i can see tl dr asshole drugs and rapes me so i find his wife years later and tell her what he did shortly after the birth of their child eta i really really appreciate the feedback from everyone even that which i may disagree with obviously rape is a very touchy subject for many people and can be quite divisive thank you all for the kind words and support even though this is an anonymous internet forum it really does mean a lot to me personally my greatest thanks again lt

the backstory this story is a few years old now im about to graduate from college as a superduper senior and this story starts between junior and senior year of high school im not sure you know the saying never stick your dick in crazy well in high school i did not realize the seriousness of that advice my ex lets call her b was best friends with the girl next door when i first met her she seemed like kind sweet and caring individual we met that first night and immediately hit it off texting back and fourth every waking moment after that point until i asked her out two weeks later her family was pretty strict but it was understandable i was a senior guy on the football and track team with a sports car and a fairly cocky attitude i was also an eagle scout and all around good guy so i managed to get in her familys good graces fairly quickly things seemed good for a while until we got past the phase of absolute good behavior no matter what thats when things started to go downhill she revealed to me that she had been a cutter in the past but that it was no longer an issue this it turned out was a lie as time went on she started to ease me into the idea that she liked self harm and that i was the thing that kept her afloat every day as a year old in his first real relationship i figured that i was a pretty awesome guy and i might be able to salvage what was otherwise a bad situation so i stuck with it thinking that things would get better throughout my senior year it became clear that she wasnt formerly into self harm it was still in full swing and me being the loving boyfriend i was tried to help her through it around march i had finally had it and tried to break up for the first time she told me that if i did this i would be signing her death warrant as she would become suicidal looking back this was the point that i should have called to cops i stupidly stuck around after this trying to bring her mental health up it wasnt like i didnt like her it was just that she stressed me out with her depressing bullshit after the breakup attempt though things changed she knew she had kept me on the hook out of sheer crazy maneuvering so she was always trying to gain the upper hand and any time i was holding my own it became my fault that she was cutting herself remember i was a year old kid naive to the world and really just trying to be sweet and loving it was around this time that she started gas lighting me and trying to turn me against anyone that was a friend or family to me that would say she was being crazy if she fucked up it was suddenly my fault and the relationship immediately became much less fun i am not proud to say that i put up with this bullshit for another year and a half it went on entirely too long and i will admit i fell for her brainwashing losing contact with nearly all my friends and my dads side of the family eventually i couldnt take it and left town to go to a different college further north in the state after a few weeks in a new town hanging out with my old friends and realizing that i was a pretty awesome dude in my own right i ended it casting off her brainwashing petty bullshit once and for all i immediately was getting texts i miss you i love you forever and always which started to quickly turn to come back im sad and finally bottoming out around i carved your initals into my leg and i took a bottle of pills let me put this straight i didnt and dont want her dead i just wanted to be free from that environment and i still cared for some reason just not enough to stay so i called when she told me she took a bottle of pills and when she didnt answer i called back maybe more times over the course of the next hour trying to get in touch with her or her friends to see if she was ok fast forward to the next day i get a call from the local sheriff from my hometown m i just got out of a conversation with b and she wants to file a harassment complaint against your calls yesterday so i explained the details to officer friendly that she was nuts and that it was not normal behavior on my part for that to happen he replied with thats fine she struck me as not normal and i tend to think given knowing youim from a small town ive met him before even been to barbecues with mutual friends that this isnt normal anyway youve been asked to not contact her again i replied that that was fine i broke up with her trying to get away so that was it i didnt talk to her again the revenge so at this point i had been away for another year and a half or so in my time in the university i rushed a fraternity and had dated a few times leaving b well into my past as a distant unpleasant memory one day i got a text from her out of nowhere hey its b i just got a new job and im dancing at lounge tonight you should come i looked up what this lounge she was dancing at was and it turns out that its a strip club and a pretty sleezy and low budget one at that i confronted one of my friends and pledge brothers in my fraternity f about the situation and what we should do about it and together we concocted a plan f saw me when i was with b and saw the bitchy shit she pulled and then heard about her call to the sheriff we got as many brothers together as we could and gave them a briefing session about what was up ms ex b is working at the lounge tonight here are pictures of her and what her outfit will be again she sent me photos trying to lure me there whatever you do do not get any dances from her or tip her when shes working the pole as word spread we got around guys in the house of to carpool to the lounge and fill that place more that it had been in years and throughout the night not a single one of my brothers gave b a cent instead getting lap dances and going to the pole whenever she wasnt there if she was in a place trying to gain customers we would empty that area over the course of the night i would bet we spent somewhere between grand and as best i could tell not a single cent spent on b the whole night the next day i got a text from b saying what the shit was that it was my first night and on the most crowded night that place has had in years nobody tipped me the boss just fired me because of not making any cash so i told her you said i cant contact you again or youd file harassment charges i just did what you asked and never contacted you againi then told my bro f i think i just won tldr in the end i managed to get out of an abusive as fuck relationship get closer with of my frat bros get my ex fired from a rd rate strip club and win the break up edits for formatting and some basic changes edit shout out to uwhiteguycash for the gold first time gilded so thank you

my friend was stationed in korea at the time on a yr tour he had aiped his wife is korean when a new warrant officer came in approx months after his arrival my friend never really cared for this officer however he dealt with it it was a known fact within the office that this officer was married with a family back in the states well shortly after arriving in korea the warrant officer met a young yr old korean girl who he began dating they dated quite a bit and everyone kind of turned a blind eye this is actually illegal in the military before i say anything please note i married a lovely korean woman and i am very happy with her and think korean people are great with this being said because of how korean society treats schooleducation young korean people generally lack the relationship maturity when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex as an american dating at yrs old is not uncommon my first girlfriendkiss was at i dont think that unusual my wifes first boyfriendkiss was at and most of her friends are right around that age group many korean girls that i know first boyfriendskiss came in around the age of yrs old which means this girls first boyfriend was this officer she didnt have the relationship maturityexperience to see everything not saying korean people are immature however i just thought that point needs to be clarified in fact they are very hard working well it really surprised everyone especially my friend when this officer proposed to this girl my friend got extremely worried at this point what was this guy doing was he really this stupid well he still turned a blind eye it was time for the officer to go back home by this time the girl had moved all of her stuff to the officers home the officer had all of her belongings packed up and sent back to america the officer brought the girl to the airport to get on the flight this girl went out and got her passport told her parents she moving to america and dropped everything in her life for this guy who she didnt even know he was married well they get to the airport and its her first time at the airport they walk around grab a coffee etc when he tells her he has to go to the bathroom he grabs his bag and off to the bathroom she waited for him she waited for him for approx mins before she decided to start looking for him she spent a good minutes checking for him asking around if anyone had seen him she got airport security involved about hrs later but they werent much help she was in tears she of course thought the worst something terrible had happened to the love of her life she called my friend in tears my friend was obviously confused the flight had been scheduled to leave hrs ago what happened he handed the phone to his wife so she could speak korean and he saw his wifes face go from a face of concern to confusion and then he knew her face became angry no angry is a nice way of saying this she fucking pissed off at this scumbag im sure at this point shed like nothing better to cut his balls off his wife explained everything to my friend the officer had abandoned his girlfriendfuture wife at the airport not only did he ditch this girl in the airport with the pretense of living with him forever he also took all of her stuff to america my friend rushed off to the airport a lengthy drive approx hrs to collect her on the way he took the time to make a few phone calls he had one of his soldiers even pull the officers home phone number lets just say my friend had a very interesting conversation with the following individuals commander of the officers former unit commander of the officers next unit his wife ill let you assume how those conversations went suffice to say that officer was discharged from the military and received a court martial here is what i know what happened for a fact he got divorced alimonychild support he got kicked out of the military he lost his retirement this was worth millions of dollars over the course of a lifetime edit grammar and cleared up a few points
my ex and i purchased the house in which he grew up we wanted to add a shutoff valve to the main water line inside the house so we could do some plumbing repairs to multiple items in the house our plumber told us he could not locate the citys main shutoff valve thats usually in the front of the house and we would have to pay a ginormous amount of money to freeze the line to get the work done not an option for us especially since the city provides our water and they should be able to turn it off right so i called the city water dept to have them shut off the water from the main city line the plumber told us the city should be able to locate this for us two city workers show up i will call them beavis and butthead b and b go out front and spend a few minutes looking for the shutoff valve cover they dont find it they come to my door and proceed to tell me the news and that it is my responsibility to hire someone to dig up my front yard to locate the underground shutoff valve i asked why i should have to do it as i was always under the impression that it was the citys responsibility to have access to my water shutoff valve i was told in no uncertain terms that women just dont understand how water systems work and i would have to deal with it on my own well im not the smartest person in the world but i understand the basics of how i get water from the city i also know that if the city workers want to shift that responsibility to me i will find a way to put the responsibility back where i truly believe it belongs since the city cant shut off my water i guess i can get free water forever so why should i pay for it one year later and i havent paid a water bill i finally get a call from the city comptroller asking when i plan on paying my water bill i tell him i will gladly pay my water bill as soon as they shut off my water you could hear the astonishment in his voice you want us to shut off your water i knew i was about to pay back b and b right then mr comptroller was very pissed off when i told him all the details of my discussion how b and b refused to find the shutoff and how they insulted me when they made their comment about how women just didnt understand how water stuff works blah blah blah i must say he was very sympathetic and he apologized profusely he promised he would get to the bottom of the problem and would call me back he did not sound too happy with the city water dept the next day i get a call from the comptroller and he tells me that b and b would be at my house whenever i had time to see them and he had stressed to them how important it was to find the main valve i made an appointment and sure enough b and b show up with a bobcat and some shovels and proceed to dig up the easement between the street and sidewalk but they dont find the shutoff so they get out their sledgehammers and start to break up two slabs of sidewalk before they finally find the shutoff valve completely buried under the sidewalk well when they came to the door and told me they found the shutoff all i could do was gloat they were all hot and sweaty and dirty and if they hadnt been such jerks i would have offered them a nice icy beverage by their sheepish demeanor i could tell they had been dressed down for their behavior it was a glorious moment within a couple of days the shutoff was moved to the easement the sidewalk was replaced b and b apologized and my plumbing problems got fixed dont tell me women dont understand plumbing 
im a professor at a state university for the past years and teach prehealth and premed students ive many stories both good and bad but ive never felt the need to retaliate against a student until one day i met my nemesis this student wanted to go to medical school though they were of very middling intellect and came off as socially inept and personally odious i and my class stood in her way so i had to be shoved out of the way on her route to being a healer she figured the best way to get ahead was to be the squeaky wheel and bitch about everything in academia if you complain enough about a class we give you a high grade and send you up to the next poor bastard for you to torment rinse and repeat so nemesis went all out to find everything and anything to complain about exam had questions on it syllabus said questions complaint lecture notes were released in a format that was based on pdf but the student wanted powerpoint hell no complaint missed inclass questions on quizzes and material wasnt covered in lecture readings children i assign them for my health complaint inappropriate language in lecture anatomy class penis penis penis but always anatomically correct complaint i did not return her emails the same day she wrote them complaint everything i did said or thought about complaint by the end she had escalated these issues all of the way to the top and i got called into the deans office my administrators above me have worked with me for years giving me no fear of a student going over my head with a complaint but this student tried dean neverminditllheal this student has sent more than a dozen complaints to the administration me just a dozen i was betting far far more dean normally we would let this pass as this student is known for doing this and has even involved legal counsel in previous classes but you have somehow exceeded her previous complaint record by a factor of and none of her other instructors this semester have gotten one she has singled you out for complaints and some arguably appear to be about you specifically targeting this student yeah in clinical cases i replaced all of the patients names with her first name even if the patient was a guy but her name was very common and there were three other ones with that name in class so go easy dont antagonize her just ride it out and be done with it me thanks dean good talk bro my nemesis kept it up i gave her a higher grade than she deserved which i believe was the whole point as she needed the grades for med school then i washed my proverbial hands a year later i was assigned to be the committee head of the faculty that create group letters of recommendation for medical school applications and she submitted the form for our committee to create her recommendation packet students can and should waive the right to read these evaluations if you are afraid of what a professor will say about you dont ask them for a letter my nemesis made sure to point out to the committee in a formal letter that because of problems with all of the professors that would be writing letters she wanted to make sure their letters were appropriate and of the correct tone and content before we sent them off therefore she would review them before approving them for inclusion in her packet nobody wanted to drop the atom bomb on her and write a true letter as you know lawyers and she would see all of these letters as would her counsel before we sent them so our hands were tied but one brave souls went around and solicited her letter writers into creating sublime choruses of praise these would be the letters you would expect to read to the nobel committee about hawking einstein newton and feynman we are talking true works of art nobody would believe that a student with this background or mcat score could get one of these eulogy masterpieces let alone a whole panel and i included a note from the committee stating that the student had previously filed academic complaints against each and every professor that wrote her a letter therefore these letters may not reflect her true academic potential we got our ferpa lawyer to check this with a fine tooth comb but our committee had a duty in our committee recommendation letter to inform those reading the professors individual recommendations if there may be a mitigating circumstance or formal action that could influence the veracity and quality of the recommendations the student didnt have the right to see that part unless they request it later after the letters have been sent out unfortunately for them so she carpet bombed the medical schools with primary applications every md do and offshore school that existed got one the cost must have been staggering but with parents that can afford lawyers for their brat in undergrad i am sure they footed the bill gladly to get her out of the house within her application packet came those beautiful letters and those three explosive paragraphs explaining that this student filed academic complaints against every letter writer and did not waive the right to keep their letters secret it doesnt take a genius on the admissions committee of each of these schools to read between the lines on this one and drop that application in the trash before granting an interview she did not get one interview more than applications not one school invited her to continue her application process that gets a professorial booooyaaaaah and for those of you whose lives i may have saved by preventing her from becoming the most litigious and incompetent doctor imaginable and screwing up treatment to you or your loved ones you are most heartily welcome 
had a salesman work for me who was a likable enough guy we lived in the same town our families knew one another and we shared a handful of mutual friends i was good to this guy we paid him generously we were patient as he tried to build a clientele we allowed unlimited leave when he had a baby and for his older kids needs too turned out he was working for someone else while also working for me he was stealing information and sharing it with them about our business i found this out after having to fire him for lying and forging a customers signature and faking a po let him go found out all the other stuff about his other work sharing secrets and found lots of illicit info on him computer while i was mad i didnt do anything because i didnt want to think about him anymore never spoke of him poorly around town and didnt share gossip so i was surprised to learn he was bad mouthing me spread lies and made up a story about why he quit caused his kid to threaten my kid at school my revenge was subtlei posted in the missed connections section of craigs list a post about him discribing an anonymous gay sex rendevious he is married at his home since i knew him and his personal details i was able to make a plausible story that after postedreceived lots of responses asking if i was looking for my former employee i said yes to over emails asking for information fast forward weeks later i heard his wife threw him out of the house revengebest served cold
this is a story about some revenge i orchestrated on behalf of my best friend my best friend is an artist she makes her living on her art which is a pretty difficult thing to do she also pays me to handle the daytoday business end of things that she doesnt like to deal with so when someone tries to screw her over i have a vested interest in putting a stop to it my friends art is fairly popular online which means it gets stolen a lot one of the things i take care of is keeping an eye out for infringement and contacting the people who have stolen from her i try to handle things civilly most of the thieves honestly dont know better theyre the kind of people who think that because they found it on google images its free for anyone to use most of the time they apologize and agree to stop once i explain to them that it is copyright infringement a couple of months ago i came across a guy who had taken one of my friends product designs copied it exactly and was now making and selling copies via instagram unlike most of the people i deal with this guy was actually an artist himself he was a college student majoring in social media and minoring in product design so youd think hed understand copyright and how to behave on the internet right nope he gave a halfassed apology and promised not to sell the reproductions anymore a few months later i was doing my usual google searches to hunt for art thieves when i came across the same guy he was no longer selling the design but he had added photos of it to his digital resume his linkedin and his profile on behance a website where artists and designers go to show off and get jobs now this guy has a huge social media presence as youd expect from someone with a degree in social media he has an account with every social media website in existence and about fifty ive never heard of the guy is obviously using social media and networking to land his first big job since he graduated in may and hes using my friends art and claiming it as his own in order to get hired potential employers are going to hire him based on a product design that he stole now at this point im pissed ive given him a chance to do the right thing he knows that hes in the wrong here hes been caught and instead of apologizing and moving on hes posted my friends work all over the internet claiming it as its own i can tell from the date on the posts that he uploaded all these images after we talked to him and informed him that he was infringing on her copyright thats when i decided to hit him where it hurt right now there is nothing more important to this guy than his name so i wrote up a blog post with the guys name and a long documentation of his theft including all the photos the post spread like wildfire and within just a few hours the search results for the guys name lead to my post my post is currently the th result when you search the guys name tldr you steal my friends art for your resume i make sure all your potential employers know what kind of person you are

my parents run a tow truck company they often are tasked with towing and impounding vehicles on behalf of the police most often when drunk drivers are caught and found unfit to drive his business is in a part of the world bc canada where rules against drunk drivers can be absolutely crushing licenses can be suspended breathalysers can be required day impounds may be required etc so we get a police job to go pick up a ford escape and impound it for days fees for this type of thing can go as high as depending on where it was towed from days after the drunk driver shows up to pick up his suv when he realizes that he owes a lot of money for the towing and storage of the car not to mention his fines and penalties from the police and insurance he flips out punches my dad in the face and runs out of the lot driving away with the guy who drove him there the vehicle is left in the yard police are called its all on security cameras and a warrant is issued for his arrest nothing happens the police dont find the guy and his bill keeps going up for every day it sits he has a guy claiming to be a lawyer phone in every few days but your client has to be here in person for us to release his vehicle for obvious reasons arrest mainly that guy isnt showing up so the company proceeds to make a claim for the vehicle dad drives into the city does that and visits the courthouse to take care of another issue when low and behold his assailant just so happens to be there dad calls the police and the courtroom sheriff promptly arrests him with my dad standing beside him dad laughing all the way casually strikes up a conversation with the sheriff about a pretty nice ford escape i just got for a cheap price the guy hasnt been sentenced yet but he does have a history with the police why hed accompany someone to a courthouse when there was a warrant for his arrest ill never know im going to assume because hes not a smart man
one day last summer i was out and about running some errands when a small car randomly cut me off in a parking lot the driver was on his cell phone and clearly not paying attention over the course of the next little distance he proceeded to cut me off several more times unsure if this guy was genuinely clueless because of the cell phone being held to his ear or if he had some random vendetta against me i decided to put some distance between us unfortunately at the next intersection we were both stopped at the red light the second the red light turned green i heard a honk okay i didnt leave the line as if it were a quarter mile drag but i wasnt taking any longer then the average driver then a second honk and i looked in my rear view mirror and this guy is giving me the finger being a little pissed at this guys notsostellar driving i decided to throw my truck in park and go confront him it was a stupid idea for so many reasons but sometimes my lack of fear makes me do stupid things i get back to his window and simply ask if there is a problem he puts his phone on his lap and then goes on a rant about how shitty of a driver i am and that i didnt move once the light turned green i asked if he wanted to start over in a more polite way he told me to fuck off then picked his phone back up and i shit you not he said sorry mom some asshole is blocking the road i ripped the phone out of his hand and began walking back to my truck he hopped out and began to charge at me but stopped the moment he realized i was not fucking around and ready to fight back he then asked for his phone back in a decently polite way i told him sure as long as you can catch i launched his iphone straight up into the air as high as i could he managed to stumble and miss catching his phone by mere inches it smashed into a million little pieces i immediately felt bad not for breaking his phone that felt great i felt bad that i was probably going to get in shit by the police and have to deal with that i dont mind a minor thing like that going on my record it is perfectly spotless otherwise so i decided to go straight to the police in hopes that i could reduce problems by immediately turning myself in at the station the other driver arrived shortly after me i assume it took him a little bit of time to pick up the pieces of his phone the police spoke to us separately he was first and it took about minutes then the cop came in to speak to me he said i have issued him two tickets one for distracted driving cellphones are banned while driving and one for reckless driving he has had three complaints and written warnings for other similar situations where he was on his cell phone and nearly caused accidents so i dont believe him when he tells me he wasnt on his cell phone as for you you shouldnt break peoples cell phones or even confront them no matter how bad their driving is report them to us and we will deal with it on a personal level i bet that felt good have a good day and remember not to get into any of these altercations i laughed at the outcome of that i walked outside and seen the other driver pulling out of the lot i gave him the most smug smile and wave i could muster up tldr bad drivers cuts me off several times when i confront him he verbally attacks me i smashed his phone police sympathized with me and gave the other driver two tickets

my sophomore year in high school i wrestled against a girl didnt have a problem with it until i discovered that she was a cheating dirty bitch she had long finger nails and kept jabbing me in the side i wasnt sure if she was doing it intentionally until after i reversed her when she scratched my arm from elbow to wrist she grabbed my arm dug her nails in and dragged her nails down to my hand without a doubt i knew she was trying to scratch me i pointed this out to the ref after the first period and she said it was an accident i pointed out the red marks on my ribs under my singlet where she had been jabbing me but he just waived it off and ignored my complaints so in the second period she was on bottom and i was on top and my back was to the ref so his vision was blocked i quickly gave her two quick rabbit punches in the face i dont care that she was a girl if you intentionally play unfair then you have to face some consequences she had probably been getting away with that shit because she was a girl up until then after i decked her she finished the rest of the match fairly she didnt even bother trying to complain to the ref about how i put her back in check
about years ago i had a horrible boss this guy was an asshole and liked it it went beyond being demanding or easy to anger he actually took pleasure in trying to humiliate and belittle everyone in every single conversation he had with them he was a director and let it go to his head this guy would demand you do something and when you did it demand to know who told you to do it and when you said it was him he would smile and threaten your job i avoided him as best i could however at one point a posting in another state opened up and i wanted the job i asked for and was given said posting i was told to be in that state in two weeks i broke the lease on my apartment and paid the difference my wife quit her job we went out there on our own dime and found a place to live two days before we were set to move i get the call its the asshole boss dont bother going out there i have decided to eliminate the posting i was livid my life was totally interrupted and when i complained i was told i had an attitude problem i stewed for a few days but then found a position at another company in the state i wanted to be in and moved out there anyway i came to find out that eventually this asshole director took another job at the competition all went well for awhile but then he got greedy and began negotiations with yet another companyusing his corporate email address like a fucking idiot they obviously found out and fired his ass but the icing on the cake was that the other company he was talking with never gave him the job after allso there he was jobless this was pleasure enough for me total schadenfreude through a friend who knows the asshole i found out that he never seemed to get a job after that months went bythen then then yearsthen yearshe got poorer and poorer his hot wife left him and took his children with her he was sleeping in an empty house which was eventually foreclosed and he got kicked out of it at this point things get fuzzy because even my friend didnt know where he was he may have been in the street he may have moved in with his aging mother meanwhile my own career had been on an upward arc and i was climbing higher up that corporate ladder it wasnt long before his resume ended up on my desk its a small industry normally i would have tossed out his application because everyone and their mother in this biz knew he was caught courting the competition on the company dime his reputation as a total ass was well known and the job he applied for was low level i mean bucks an hour low level grunt work he was a former director at figures and now was willing to work shitty work at a shitty wage just to feed himself anyone would have considered him overqualified including me but i had to have him in my office i wanted to see him on the other side of my desk asking me for bread crumbs like a common street beggar i wanted to see this asshole who nearly ruined my and a dozen others lives and laughed at it groveling for a job at my fucking feet so of course i scheduled an interview i was going to waste his time like he wasted mine it was one of the most pleasurable experiences i have ever had he pretended not to recognize me but i could see that he did he had gotten skinnier and reeked of despiration he had no idea that i knew the whole story so he lied to me about the whole reason he was out of work and when i told him exactly why he looked defeated i told him i had no place for a liar let alone an asshole and when he tried to shake my hand at the end of the interview i refused and asked him to leave there is an old saying you see the same people on the way down as on the way up
last weekend i attended the beer fest in edmonton ab canada the whole thing seemed like it was laid out and planned by a year old with a lot of bottle necks dead ends and zero gathering areas so because of this it was pretty slow to walk around the whole place my husband and i didnt mind we would just grab samples from each stand we went to so we would never go thirsty between vendors there was one girl however that felt the need to get somewhere as quickly as she could my husband and i had just picked up our latest beer samples and began walking towards where the rest of our friends were standing there was a long line of people in front of us trying as well to get to the other side of the venue it was slow as you had to stop every seconds to avoid spilling beer on some one or disrupting small groups trying to hold conversations but everyone was polite and would move out of your way as quickly as they could so were on our way my husband leading the way but theres a woman behind me with her cell phone literally on my back texting away who keeps bumping into me since shes not paying attention we had to stop at the corner where there was a massive bottle neck she ran directly into me and then i hear her say this isnt going to work for me and proceeds to push my arm trying to bulldoze past me which in turn causes me to spill some of my beer on my husbands arm and my forearm upon seeing this the woman behind me turns to her boyfriend and laughs then again proceeds to try to push past us revenge mode kicks in and all i can think of is the dose of instant karma this cunt needs so with my beer still in my hand i quickly turn towards her at the same time she is trying to push past us my arm hits hers which proceeds to fling the entire contents of my beer cup all over her chest and face of course i apologize immensely as she stands there in disbelief she slinks away in one direction as i turn back and get another beer from the closest vendor victory is mine and the next beer tasted delicious tldr girl at beer fest thinks she is important enough to push me from behind so i clumsily spill my entire beer all over her chest and face
im crossposting this here after some people suggested i do so through both pms and notsosubtle hints in the comments so i started working in a photo lab for a popular store a few years ago and i was trained by a girl who had worked there for about six years i honestly think she was bipolar or something some days she would be super sweet to me and other days she would rip my head off for the most minor stuff omg strangelovenebula you put a fucking marker in the pen drawer heads are gonna roll she always made me really nervous that i was fucking up my job constantly complained about everything i did and was just a really crazy bitch to everyone that worked there one time she freaked out and told me that dozens of customers had lodged complaints about me she never specified about what when i asked my store manager he had no idea what she was talking about she was just nuts and i think she enjoyed trying to make me feel bad which is tough since im pretty easygoing anyways at the end of the night i would have to remove this film rack out of the film processor and put it in a bowl of water to keep the rollers from drying out in the morning when she would open she would take it down from the shelf by the sink and put it back in the film processor for the day in my own form of petty revenge i began to fill the bowl each night exactly to the brim then i would set it on the very edge of the top shelf which was juuuust out of her reach in the mornings she would have to stand on tiptoe to get it down and inevitably the water would slosh down on her as she fumbled with the bowl she bitched at me in passing a few times but i kept it up she started hanging up signs that said not to fill the bowl all the way or not to put it on the top shelf but i ignored these and would cackle to myself a little each night as i did this she got more and more pissed off trying to complain to my store manager he pretty much ignored everything she said because it was wellknown that she was a crazy drama queen that tried to get everyone in trouble for something or other anyways i guess i cracked her because one day she was trying to complain to him about it and he wasnt really listening and refused to write me up for something so silly she ended up throwing a notebook at him as hard as she could and he fired her on the spot he promoted me to her job head photo and i got a fiftycent an hour raise its such a petty revenge but i really got a kick out of hearing other coworkers tell me how she would storm out of the lab in a huff with water dripping down her face and a damp shirt every morning a few times it really just toppled down and soaked her completely it warms the cockles of my heart dripping water hollows out stone not through force but through persistence ovid

the mods on rpettyrevenge removed this without telling me so i guess ill try here i used to work at an expensive consultancy with a boss the owner who fired me for being gay this was illegal here already but i was paid so poorly that i couldnt afford a lawyer to sue him however he hadnt thought to check with his biggest client before getting rid of me and they made him hire me back because i unfortunately needed the money and jobs were scarce here at the time i took it in addition to my part time consulting duties i was also responsible for booking all the consultants gigs and their travel arrangements and while the owner was the owner he also did occasional consulting all consulting was onsite travel to the client and we had clients all over the country so whenever a client called and asked for a consultant which was often id just check the owners calendar and if i hadnt already booked him for that week id do so preferably as far away as possible id ship him out on sunday and fly him home on saturday hed come home saturday afternoon jetlagged hed have just barely a day to recover and see his family and then hed have to leave for the airport to fly out for the next gig the clients were thrilled they thought he was the best man we had he wasnt but they thought he was he couldnt complain partly because it made him a lot of money and partly because i made sure he was never there to complain also he was a weird guy who insisted on micromanaging my computer programming work to the point that before hed leave hed tell me dont do anything on that until i get back and he meant it if i did any work on my work while he was away hed be irate but if i sat on my ass until his return hed be fine with it so he told me dont do anything on that until i get back thinking hed be back the next week and i kept him away for about four months during which time i booked the consultants and serviced my one client which all added up to working about one to two days a week and then sat in my office and read novels this was preweb and he had to pay me for it as i said this went on for about four months until his verypregnant wife appeared in my office one day loomed over me and in a very quiet voice informed me that she would like her husband back recognizing this for the quite severe threat it was i took pity on her and changed some bookings so he could come home i let him stay home for the birth of his child and for exactly the amount of paternity leave he said hed be taking and then i sent him away again note i had no intention of making him miss the birth of his child but his wife wanted him home a bit earlier than id planned so i played it her way i liked her despite her husband do not discriminate against me and then put me in charge of your schedule unless you want to be away from your wife for months and exhausted all the time
not sure if this should be posted here it is a little more dramatic than most stories you might see here and im not sure if it counts as pro revenge tldr at the bottom a bit of backstory first a long time ago when i lived with my family i was a handful to deal with i was diagnosed adhd getting into fights all the time and had severe anger issues my mother and sister had no idea how to deal with me not going to deny i was a shit of a kid i also happened to be the smartest in my family besides my stepfather who didnt live with us when it came to the subject of computers so i was the go to guy when it came to computers for my friends and for my family my family are actually the most computer illiterate people ive ever met in any case when i started coming into my teens i became less of a shit learned to control my anger a lot more and didnt get into fights as much i really really was trying to change my ways i also had a secret that i was hiding from my family and that was that i was gay when i was i came out of the closet to my family cue homophobic insults for the next two years my mother and sister showed no restraint especially when near eachother one on their own was usually fine though my sister would make passing comments like calling me disgusting i often hid in my room away from them but they would bang on my door calling me slurs my mother would frequently remind me how she was going to disown me and didnt care where i ended up this often brought me to tears and as a result i felt myself becoming a very angry and depressed person when i was my mother kicked me out of home over the next year after becoming independant i began to realize the struggles my mother faced as a single mother especially with me the struggles of dealing with my violent stepfather who ended up winning custody of my younger sister i concluded that her reaction to be coming out was probably some form of revenge but ultimately found out that she just disagreed with it though she does hold a lot of resentment towards how i acted when i was a kid over the next years i tried getting in contact with them on and off just to sit down and talk aside our differences but coming from a family from sydney west talking civilly is not my families strong suit every attempt the usual insults were thrown back at me unnatural this i will never accept your choice that from both my mother and sister this went on for three years i had given up on them at this point now during those three years my sister had a kid of her own and my mother and stepfather finally ended their tolerance of one another as such my stepfather was no longer fixing my mothers computer so on the fourth year guess who suddenly is interested in speaking to her daughter again my mother would call me asking about her smartphone and her computers and whatnot every so often i was annoyed by it but i figured this might be an opportunity to at least open the doors to us being able to be civil with one another so i helped her just to see where it would go i would travel two hours out help her fix her stuff and leave i eventually installed logmein on her computer in order to curb the travelling it would take me every so often i would mention to her mum im your daughter as well you know not just your technician her responses to that were generally just dismissive and then nothing would change over the course of months she would continue to call me asking for computerphone help and i would oblige but i would occasionally mention the above to her again skip forward i find out that my mother has cancer and has basically told every family member except me i confronted her about it she seemed very nonchalant about it as if it was normal for me not to be told stuff like this a few months ago i sent her a long message detailing why i can no longer help her because it was giving me false hope which was ignored but seen until i pressed the matter her response was telling me i deserved to be kicked out that i made her life more stressful than the cancer ever did and that im a freak who she will never accept she said she will never seek mediation with me because i am apparently the one who is unwell and so she shouldnt have to i blocked her on facebook and deleted her number at this point i felt like i had chased them enough feeling guilty and that im done trying to make up for it backstory over the revenge skip forward a few weeks my sister messages me for help her computer screen is broken and she is worried about her sons photos me hey who is this i had deleted her number so i didnt know it was her initially her its sister my computer scren is brokn amp im jus wonderin if i can get my fotos off me you know im sick of this computer shit right fuck off her righto mate all i wantd ws no if i culd get my sons fotos off eat a fat one me youll put on a friendly face when you need my help but the moment i decline you show me what you truly think of me reverting to an angry demeanor and flinging what you know to be hurtful insults hopefully you can work on that in years to come so your son doesnt pick up this trait of yours and become a bully her fuck off gronk im trying to figure out how to save every single foto i own of him since birth so dont u dare comment on my angry demeanor all i wanted to know is if there was a way me my going rate is an hour her fuck off metell me why should i care i dont know your son i dont know you youre just this jackass who hurls insults at me every now and again oh and between insults you ask me for help thats who you have been to me for the last years that got rid of her and then two days ago my mother messages me basically saying she thinks shes being hacked mum i dont think it was a good idea to leave log me in enabled like you suggested someone got into my computer me dont care its no longer my problem i didnt care i couldve easily helped both of them could have reassured my mother gotten my sisters photos off but after all of that fuck those guys tldr family treat me like shit for the better part of a decade for being gay decide to pretend it never happens when they want my help with computer related stuff i help them for a bit mum has cancer and tells everyone but me i tell her i cant help her anymore she lashes out at me but asks me for help months later because shes being hacked i decline helping her sister also asks for help recovering her sons photos from her failing computer i also decline helping her end edit added a bit more to phone dialogue

this time we were providing pa and backline for an african tour we had a run of a few shows every couple of days they started off ok i have a million promoter fail type stories although not all of them would be suitable for prorevenge typical african musicians though wanting to soundcheck for hours before performing for another hours these are long days also the level of professionalism that we are all used to goes out the window when you are dealing with inexperienced promoters and label reps who are new to this country and the near clinical way in which we operate we run things like a military operation if you think that every gig is run by stoned out roadies who sit watching spinal tap every day on the tourbus you are mostly mistaken like i said we run things strictly on time and we follow safety procedures and everyone on the crew is professional we struggle when people expect us to lower our standards to theirs so anyway we did some shows and the rule for this tour due to the volatile nature of the events people in the audience like to stab and kill each other every show so theres a risk of police shutdowns every show we decide to employ the tactic of payment for the following show at the end of the night in other words on show we got paid for that show and also the next show we turn up for show and also get paid for show etc we are at show and at the end of the night we couldnt find the promoter its a thursday and the next show is in london on the saturday night no stress we load out of the venue and i drop a text to the promoter me hey missed you tonight can you arrange to bank transfer the payment over to me for saturdays show no response that night he must be tired and gone to bed next day friday he calls me up and says he will wire me the money asap i tell him that i wont be departing for london until am on saturday morning its a hour drive from me he has until then to transfer me the money or i will assume the show is cancelled me and the rest of the team agree to call each other around am to check if the gig is on next day saturday at am i check the bank no funds no expectant funds nothingzip we all switch our phones off and have a day out with our respective friends and families a nice day off around pm i decide to switch my phone on im coming out of the cinema with my girlfriends my phone beeps i glance at the screen missed calls a dozen answer phone messages and texts from the promoter just as im about to laugh out loud the phone rings its the promoter promoter hey so ummmm where are you me im just outside the cinema on the way to nandos promoter laughs nervously errr you do know theres a show tonight right me errrr no theres not i reply quite reassuringly promoter what do you mean im at the venue now with the band where are you me im on my way to nandos for dinner im miles away the backline and pa is in a truck a further miles away all the crew are having a day off like i said there is no show tonight remember how i said we were supplying pa and backline the musicians were stood around onstage with no drums no keyboards no amps no pa system no techs not even a cable the promoter starts stressing big time on the phone to me pleading with me to rescue the show i ask him what time the doors are he says pm me ok look heres the thing it ll take me an hour to get to the truck its a hour drive to london itll take another hour to load in and another hours to setup for your show its pm now so that means we wont be ready to go for another hours promoter you mean hours me no because by the time you have personally driven up here to pay me my money before i set off thats going to be another hours which makes promoter shellshocked oooohhhhhhhh noooooooo suddenly realising he has fucked up and will have to refund the entire show i might sound harsh but this promoter has repeatedly tried to screw me and many of my colleagues over many times over the years he plays up to his cheeky little geezer type character his boss the head honcho was not happy with him we turned up for the tuesday show because we got paid in advance on the monday after tuesdays show we were paid in full for the rest of the tour a further shows 
in i was working at a vets office in high point nc during my lunch break i would drive down the road about half a mile to a game store beside an office depot to see what was available leaving the game store i saw a guy in a forest green bmw with dealer plates pull in on my drivers side slightly angled blocking me in i asked the guy if he could move his car a bit so i could pull out and he said that my piece of shit should be in a junkyard not on the road i was driving a ford galaxie fastback with a super cobra jet and weiand supercharger not a piece of shit by any means i attempt to pull out a few times but since im driving a land yacht its not happening getting more and more pissed off i decided hell with this guy cut my wheel hard right and just back out normally the front bumper of my car hits right in front of the passenger door and proceeds to tear off the front door rear door and rear quarter panel as im backing out i got out of there as quickly and possible and went back to work for about months i was worried that one day the cops would show up at my door for the hit and run but they never did
my friends and i have all been frequenting this neighborhood bar for the past year or so its popular usually fairly busy and cheap enough so as most bars go it has the one guy named brian the tool thats there every single night you go and you feel like hes there on all the nights you dont go to wearing one of the same outfits he owns that all feature a fedora and cramming the jukebox full of out of place and obtrusive heavy metal and of course hitting on everything with a vagina you know the type the one that starts with the women so far out of his league they are dots from where he is standing and works his way down the one that will literally pause between rejections and do a full scan of the bar before deciding which girl is hot enough to pursue next after having his fedora called out by us the first and only time he gave us a chance he never tried again but he was a permanent fixture in the bar what really upset me about brian the tool was how he treated a particular barfly michelle now michelle was a sweet heart and possibly the nicest girl youll ever meet but she was also chris farleys long lost sister im not joking i wish i had a picture because this girl was what happened if you slapped a dark cherry wig on tommy boy she also didnt believe in make up at any rate every night if brian couldnt score himself a pity fuck im going to say i saw him get one twice in months and michelle was around hed take her home he wouldnt speak to her all night and she once mentioned to me how she didnt even have his cell phone number but if she was there she would wait patiently until the bar shut down and him to bump her ugliest uglies it was one of the weirdest things too each time it happened he would approach her like a kid who just got clothes on xmas and sadly whisper the first sentence to her he had all night then he would leave and she didnt seem to be allowed to follow him out for minutes as though he didnt want us to know but we all knew at any rate since we couldnt help michelle we mentioned it was degrading but she wouldnt have it so you can only let moths flock to flames we gave up and let them do their dance every week flash forward months and im invited to a wedding by a guy ive been seeing walk through the door and theres brian with a very decent looking girl immediately upon seeing me brian refuses to make contact and veers his chica far far away i figure shes just a date he somehow conned so i think nothing of it in passing i mention to my date that i know the guy and get the response oh yeah thats kristins fianc come again oh yeah kristin is this super sweet nurse studying to become a pediatrician and has been dating brian for years engaged for six months apparently to help put herself through school and help support her apartment with brian who works as a very fancy temp worker at an amazon warehouse kristin outs in hour overnight shifts at the hospital suddenly its clear how brian gets away with going to the bar and pussy scouting every night his girls earning money and investing in the future and hes getting his dick wet with literally anything that will take it now this is a wedding love is in the air and the words trust honor and faithfulness are the themes and i am pissed at this useless good for nothing asshat that treats women like a buffet of squishy wet holes for his taking also his fedoras were just really fucking stupid quietly without telling my date i sneak up behind the tool and corner him he goes into deer in headlights mode and kristin seems annoyed i guess women pop up all the time hey brian remember me im the girl from insert bar name kristin reacts subtly to the bars name i get the feeling shes told brian she doesnt want him going here oh yeah hey yeah hey last weekend i let michelle borrow my lighter kristin turns her head to look at brian michelle is a familiar name uh okay well i asked her for it the other day but she said she lost it i was wondering if it was on your floor i get a nasty spiteful retaliation from brian basically saying fuck no but the damage was done i watch kristin storm away dramatically and cant help but smile smugly as i watch him chase her a half an hour later both of them are gone from the wedding party tldr fuck fedoras
i wasnt quite sure if i should post this in rtalesfromtechsupport or rpettyrevenge but its more about karma revenge than anything else back in my high school days i was the typical budding introverted male computer geek i was quiet kept to myself pretty much the stereotypical chess nerd who loved to read books and play video games i had my share of bully stories and random kids that picked on me but one particular uppity bitch had it in for me lets call her valerie battitude for the sake of this story i was in her scopes nearly every day for the years i attended high school val and her teengirlsquad group of friends would torment me ruthlessly to the point i attempted suicide at a particular low point in my life the constant name calling the snide remarks questioning of my sexuality the bullying never stopped even with administration intervention high school wasnt particularly bad for me but it was val who made my life a literal living hell i was powerless because she was the queen bitch and i had at least one class with her every semester high school ends and i get my college degree my career takes off and i advance several times sadly my company hits hard times and im laid off along with most of my staff months turn into nearly a year as im waiting for my next job but my emergency nest egg is getting low in order to support myself i take up an old parttime tech job working for my former employer he was glad to have me back and i got to pick up some extra cash doing inhome tech work on the side while i continued the job search my boss gets a call from a long time client and sends me out to handle it its pretty cutndry on paper but after checking the name it dawns on me that this client is the father of valarie battitude i instantly have horrible flashbacks of all the torture i went through in hs realizing im not the same wimpy geek in hs i swallow my hateful pride to knock on the door father battitude greets me warmly and we briefly converse with idle chitchat i dont let him on that i knew his of a daughter nor that she was the bane of my existence in my hs days i do find out that his daughter is temporarily staying back at papas home as she is out traveling the country for work he had divorced from mama battitude who took half his savings account over an unnamed incident that led me to believe she cheated on him clue figured out where val got her bad attitude from we get down to business and he explains his computer problems the main issue being that the dinosaur of a pc is practically a relic of stateoftheart fossil fuel by modern day comparisons i quickly demise no amount of software repair and malware removal is going to fix the speed problem hes facing it takes a whopping minutes to boot into the log in screen and i ball my fist into a tight ball when i see val battitudes name as the secondary accounts on the windows login screen shrugging it off i recommend to papa that getting a new computer rather than spending the hours it will take trying to get it back up to merely poor standards he agrees and wants me to go with him the store and pick one up that day im conflicted as this is the father of rosemarys baby but its obviously not entirely his fault his daughter is the bitch from hell so i say what the hell and agree i call my boss and hes ok with me doing some consulting work over the pc repair he originally sent me on im off the clock on by my bosses standards and its off to xyz computer store we are shooting the breeze at what he does for a living but mostly its about how he is proud that his daughter is an entrepreneur for some startup company on the web and how she is constantly traveling the state and country im controlling my gag reflex from the puffy clouds and sparkly rainbows his daughter excretes how can he talk about the very same person that would knock my lunch into the ground and then accidently step on it while looking at me in the eye and mock im sooooo sorry we get to the store and i find out through conversing with him and the sales associate that his computer we are replacing is actually vals old college computer that he recently commandeered while she was away food for thought enough technical jargon to sink a battleship and hours later father battitude is the proud owner of a new topoftheline computer and wireless network system i install the new pc get it up and running along with the new printer wifi multiple accounts setup along with windows remote access in case he needs my boss to log in for basic help standard procedure i move onto installing the old harddrive for the data transfer and father battitude has long since vacated the room to go watch tv elsewhere my loath and disgust resurfaces as my eyes wandered across the documents of valeries personal files the data transfer starts reading off odd file name that catch my eye it doesnt occur to me given the source just what im seeing skim across the screen so i manually follow the path to said directory of her old pathetically encrypted harddrive the discovery of several thousand megabytes of personal porn pictures and hardcore webcam videos halts me in my tracks this wasnt the vastly gifted entrepreneur daughter papa battitude had led on about this was an ageing webcam pornstar who was out touring the country doing porn or hooking up with her latest fling my curiosity turned into disgust and contempt as i skimmed through several dozen more photos of freakish and occasional kinky stuff where she is degrading men or causing pain i have no problem in general with what someone does for a living my thoughts were at that instant that this bitch is using men and continuing to cause more pain even after hs i had more reason to despise and hate her over anyone else and i had her in the palm of my hands wheels started turning daddy was obviously none the wiser to what his daughter did for a living and my conscience started a personal war with my ego at one end was my willingness to extract revenge and the other was my morales saying to forgive and let it go i settled on a happy medium that both sides gleefully agreed with my fear of being sued or that i could get my boss into some serious trouble prevented me from going too far so an evil little revenge scheme would have to suffice i uploaded all the files in question to my remote file server and got to work figuring out the best way to humiliate a domineering papa snottybitch was enthusiastically watching a game that would occupy him for a few hours so i took the time to organized all her photos and videos onto her newly created desktop each folder got a unique fetish name as i filled each one with her personal pictures of shame and degradation i started to get more and more creative as i began to have fun with it valerie of xxhs class of xxxx takes on guys at her daddies home or watch valerie battitude get dped on her parents bed i was cackling with glee as i rigged the coup de gras none of the files could be deletedchangedremoved without administration approval guess who had that mwahahahahaah two weeks later i get the phonecall i was waiting for from my boss father battitude request that i take a look at his daughters login account as there was something wrong with it the look on her face when i showed up at her fathers doorstep was priceless anger and rage quickly sinks into horror and regret as it dawns on her just who was behind all this the next half hour was mostly sobs and her saying sorry a thousand times over im a softy at heart but like captain malcolm reynolds of firefly says im a good guy stabs the guy in the gut well ill settle for just all right tldr version hs bully gets just deserts more than a decade later as all of her personal webcamporn files are organized and displayed in a humiliating way then is duped into meeting facetoface to her horror edited the name of valerie edit i wrote this story to help me with my writing skills write what you know please note that i wrote this in an attempt to get in my old self ie character this does not reflect who i am now 
by simply googling my dead brothers name i uncovered the pro revenge he attempted to exact on our mother by killing himself im the youngest of three boys my oldest brother committed suicide in at age without leaving a note heres the story my oldest brother grew up a conflicted man he was brilliant and honest but he had a very volatile relationship with our mother that seemed to center around her attempts to hold onto and control money we all felt this as we were very poor but my oldest brother seemed to take her efforts to deny us the basics of life personally the rest of us felt that our meager lifestyle of yard sale clothes no toys barber school haircuts dented cans and stale bread was simply a product of our poverty by the time he reached his early s he moved out but continued to stop by and try to engage our mother in arguments designed to teach her the errors in her thinking this never went well he eventually went to brown university on a full scholarship and began teaching in an inner city setting it was at this point around that he began his decent into depression and major mental illness he selfmedicated with alcohol and anti depression meds i could see the changes in him monthly by he was not the same person that i grew up with he picked verbal fights saw enemies everywhere and began to act out at his job i later learned that it was around this point and ill explain how later he decided to commit suicide but he had unfinished business with my mother so he concocted a twisted scheme aimed to devastate her at her weakest moment he purchased a secret life insurance policy named my mother as the beneficiary without her knowledge and secretly paid the premium every moth despite he and his wife having deep financial issues of course his wife knew nothing of the suicide plans or the policy insurance policies have a lengthy waiting period before they will pay out in the case of a suicide but thats okay because my brother wanted to have a little fun before killing himself anyway his fun included adopting the concern level of a honey badger and messing with every teacher student administrator and custodian he disliked his devastating intellect was his weapon and he used it to embarrass and shock his targets he eventually was suspended multiple times for verbally assaulting a janitor and for allowing his th grade students to cut his hair and drive his car he also created drama by telling stories of bar fights with famous people and lying to get out of attending meetings he had become an out of control prick and was drinking everyday his wife held it together but she was beginning to crack under the pressure all the while my brother was fine because he knew it would all be over soon and he was living his new life of giving zero fucks and his plan to screw with my mother was coming along fine i attempted to get him into numerous programs i even cut ties with him from my own children and told him that all he needed to do was to get into a program and even if he failed could resume our close contact he opted to continue his rampage our parents saw no real need for concern so they didnt join with me my father even expressed anger at me for me giving him that ultimatum around he began predicting his own death to his classes knowing that th graders are very gullible he shrouded it with being told by psychics that he would die at home and in a year that ended with a this is what i learned by googling his name about years after his death when i did a link to a video game forum popped up and a pm yearold post by one of his students had made about his teacher dying this is when i realized that my brothers suicide was planed years before he did it i emailed that student and he gave me the whole story of my brother riveting the class on several occasions with tales of his own death heres the intended revenge plan and its years too late exposure in my mother passed my brothers death years earlier began her mental and physical breakdown all she wanted to know was why of course we had no idea why but her death triggered a records search at prudential insurance where she had her own policy my dad had begun the wheels in motion by filing for her payout and the search kicked back my brothers name because that was ironically where he had his secret life insurance policy the agent asked my dad who the person who came back in the search was and my dad stated that it was his oldest son who had committed suicide back in you see my brother despite his brilliance didnt know how life insurance worked and he assumed that his death would somehow cause his policy to force a payout to my mother this would have happen when all of us were deep in contemplation as to why he would kill himself and right then my mother would then get the check the check was his suicide note directly to my mother alone and it was the one thing that has dogged their relationship forever money but the insurance company did not know of his death in they assumed hed just allowed the policy to lapse my brothers wife knew nothing of the policy and neither did my mother my dad who is and failing never connected the dots as he doesnt know of my brother predicting his own death my father provided prudential with the copy of the death certificate of both my brother and my mother and they verified that the policy was enforce at the time of my brothers suicide and sent my dad the benefits check ive never told my dad any of this as it would probably kill him i shared the details with my middle brother and he agrees that this was exactly what my oldest brother was up to edit for clarity this was my brothers attempt at revenge obviously he failed by not understanding that insurance companies need to be notified of someones death before they pay and yes he was in pain and needed help but he refused it he claimed that he couldnt relate to average people who were in aa and wouldnt go he was an elitist who used his intellect as an excuse to keep drinking and abusing prescription meds he was deeply deeply troubled

i recently graduated from college in another state during that time i rented a house with other girls in a primarily student neighborhood we were neat responsible tenants who paid rentbills on time and took care of the house but we were firsttime renters and therefore clueless about tenant law the landlord was very aware of that and used it to his advantage i could go on forever about what a douchelord he was but the tldr version is that he was sexist would regularly enter the house without our permission overcharge for everything and then get all offensive when we questioned it did not keep his house up to city code and ignore our requests for repairs allinall he was not a nice person you could have a more pleasant and productive conversation talking to a brick wall we did try to get legal help from the university legal services office on a few occasions but since we already signed the lease there was not a lot that could be done anyway towards the end of our lease whenever potential tenants would come tour the house we would take them aside and tell them not to sign a lease with this man we sabotaged a few attempts at finding tenants that way we also called the university offcampus housing office and told them to not allow him to advertise his property on campus or in the school paper because he was a crappy landlord the best part was when he called me to ask why i thought nobody was interested in the house i had to stifle a smile and say i dont know maybe the economy is bad edit added missing words

for a while i worked as a web designer in a small ad agency serving a very niche industry previously the design team had no creative lead and were all sort of operating independently across varying clients we decided to hire a creative director to fill that gap and i was given the task of sorting through and giving first round interviews to find the person who would later become my supervisor two candidates in particular stood out from the rest for very different reasons one was exceptionally talented an all around nice guy and somebody who generally would have been great for the role the other lets call him john had mediocre talent came across as an insufferable arrogant prick but had previous experience working within the niche industry that we serviced he also had contacts within that industry that could lead to new business despite my strong recommendation to not hire john his relationships in the industry were too compelling to our agencys leadership to pass up and they hired him it didnt take long before the entire company started to realize john was a huge burden he had virtually zero experience in anything related to digital design design for apps websites mobile etc were all completely and utterly beyond his grasp but he used his position of relative power to make decisions on those projects that the entire design team refused to support most of which came back to bite the company in the ass later the design team hated him because fixing and working around his screwups became part of our daily routine the sales team hated him because hed claim it took him unbelievably exaggerated amounts of time to complete even the most trivial of tasks ex days to design a business card template so they wouldnt even assign him projects anymore work that was clearly his responsibility started to rapidly trickle down to the rest of the design team wed be working late nights out of days a week because all of his projects that were in danger of missing deadlines would be reassigned to us meanwhile hed be the first to walk out the door every day right at pm without fail on top of all that the guy was absolutely without a doubt the biggest tool ive ever met always right about everything completely unbending on his idiotic opinions and completely clueless that literally every person in the building wished he would get hit by a truck i genuinely tried to work with him for about a year until i decided that the job had become intolerable because of him and wasnt going to change any time soon so i turned in my two week notice about a month after i left i heard that he had been let go from the job shortly after that i noticed that he had changed his linkedin status to show that he was working for a new agency i had never heard of also servicing that same niche industry i looked them up and quickly figured out that he had started his own agency a primarily digital agency when he had no experience in digital or interactive design and had literally fucked up every digitalinteractive project hed ever been on i know because most of them were reassigned to me when he proved incapable of doing them himself i looked at the portfolio on his website and found literally project after project of my work he was using my work from the ad agency as examples of the work his agency could produce i briefly considered contacting him and requesting he remove my work from his portfolio for ethical reasons but i could already hear his reply in my head as creative lead all work done by my team is an extension of my creative direction hed used similar lines in the past to insert himself into receiving credit on successful projects hed had zero involvement on so instead i sent an email to one of the partners of the agency we both had worked for saying something along the lines of hey not sure if youve noticed this but it looks like john is using your companys intellectual property to directly compete against you if i had to guess id assume his next step would be to make a move at your client list the reply was short and sweet thanks for bringing this to my attention hell be hearing from our attorney in the morning johns website was brought down less than hours later 
years ago i lived in a coastal city and became friends with a guy who owned a boat he kept his boat docked near a popular tourist area and the garage he used was often full due to the crowds as a slip owner he had a pass that would give him priority at a private garage entrance so he could skip the lines and be more certain of getting a parking spot this is not uncommon for private garages that offer monthly passes or passes to employees also due to the crowds this garage had a computer that would count the number of cars going in and the cars going out it would not let any vehicles into the garage if there were no spots available one day my friend used his pass to get into the garage knowing it was nearly full after doing a full lap of all levels he realized the only remaining spot was next to an older shitbrown metallic corvette with vanity plates that had parked about a foot over the line well sucks to be that guy my friend pulled his little suv in blocking the drivers door of the vette after all parking is scarce and this guy didnt pay for two spots petty revenge later that night after a day on the water he returned to find that the corvette owner apparently didnt like having his door blocked and retaliated by keying the side of my friends cherokee he filed a claim lost his deductible and got the side of his jeep repainted about a year later he bought another boat and was working to restore the cabin he drove into the garage as he always does and starts looking for a spot when what does he see the same shitbrown corvette with the same vanity plate well the heavens were certainly thinking of justice today he got out of his jeep and opened the tailgate to peruse the plethora of instruments that were at his disposal after all he had a boat load of tools to restore his old boat screwdriver not much you can do with that hammer too cliche belt sander no power cable battery powered nail gun folks we have a winner a few quick minutes later the fiberglass body of the corvette was perforated by nails just putting nails through body panels is hardly fair to the nail gun after all nails are supposed to connect things together they must fulfill their purpose we wouldnt want those nails to suffer an existential crisis would we so the doors hood boot lid popup headlights and even the fuel cap were all nailed shut do not fuck with another mans ride revenge will be served and it may be very cold indeed

longterm bf lets call him grant whilst grant had been cheating on and gaslighting my friend the two of them for some reason decided to stay friendly grant had lived with her more like loafed off her and somewhere to live now that they had broken up i got a call fairly late at night asking if he could stay with me which i said yes to id never particularly liked grant but i figured that anything between my friend and him was none of my business and i needed someone to split the rent with grant moved in and we got on relatively well one evening sarah grant and i went to the pub we had a few drinks and then headed back to mine grant knew that sarah and i were involved fastforward about a week and grant has borrowed my laptop and got chatting with sarah online as an msn message has popped up with her saying hello he said that it was him not me and they chatted no problems here a few days later grant asks to borrow my computer one evening whilst im out i tell him the password joke about using incognito mode if hes being naughty and forget about it when i get home i ask him for the computer so that i can use it in the morning first thing in the morning i open the computer which had run out of battery in the middle of grant using it grant had been talking to sarah on msn and the last few lines of their conversation was visible it seemed somewhat inappropriate but i thought it must be innocent i scrolled up to investigate and discovered that the two of them had been sending photosvideos to each other culminating in a video from grant to sarah of a tribute nature thankfully the picturesvideos had all been sent via phones so i wasnt subjected to seeing any of them but i was pretty narked that he had arranged all of this using my computer i was furious but said nothing grant had a key to my house and owed me about in back rent which i wanted to get i talked to my calm collected neapolitan colleague about the situation to make sure i wasnt overreacting and he said you know what you have to do crumpledlinensuit i planned my revenge carefully being nice to grant the whole time by a strange twist of fate that very evening grant managed to break his door key in the slightly dodgy lock i immediately took both keys off him and said id get a new one cut the next day and not to worry about it i also casually asked if he could sort out the backrent and made up a white lie about the landlord pestering me next morning grant calls out to me whilst im in the shower that hes just popping to the atm m from the house to get the money he owes me like a flash im out of the shower dressed and grab a pack of smokes i run out to the front of the house and sit outside casually smoking grant returns from the cashpoint pays me the rent and i offer him a lucky strike which he takes i swiftly finish mine i was about halfway through when he lit up and say that im going inside to put the kettle on but could he finish smoking outside so the house doesnt smell i go in the door locks behind me i count the money and double check i have his key a minute or so later the doorbell rings and i lean out of the upstairs window and ask him loudly i was just wondering when it became ok to send videos of yourself wanking to the girl your housemates seeing he asks if we can talk about this indoors and i coldly say no if you shit on your doorstep sometimes you get shit on your shoes find somewhere else to sleep tonight youre not coming back in here i ask then him if theres anything he needs for the day then go and get him some clean work clothes his antidepressants im not totally heartless and a few other necessities which i bag up and pass to him out of the window he has a few hours before he needs to be at work and i just leave him sitting on the wall outside whilst i go out the back exit to go to work myself i tell him that he can send me a message to arrange to pick up the rest of his stuff once hes sorted a place to live he ended up staying with friends that night and collecting his stuff a few days later i have no idea what happened to him afterwards i never spoke to him again just cold hard cut him out sarah sent me a message later that day saying that she thought i was massively overreacting and to get in contact if i had calmed down enough i just ignored it i bumped into her a year or so later she apologised for her actions and we decided to forgive and forget i helped her with some academic stuff and we parted on better terms although its been several years now since ive seen her all in all i was actually more upset with grant than i was with sarah although i thought it was pretty shitty behaviour all round i later found out that all the time grant was with my friend he had been sending similar videos unsolicited to girls he worked with revenge was sweet especially being so cold about it tldr housemate was inappropriate with lass i was seeing i locked him out and told him to find somewhere else to live then never spoke to him again edit added in fake names for clarity edit jesus wept i know there is some mild uncertainty about the legality of this but it was years ago the guy was a friend and was staying there as a favour whilst helping me cover the rent in return maybe some tenancy rights were violated if under the law of england and wales and not the usa the shortterm adhoc arrangement we had a actually counted as a tenancy and b could even be proved given that it would only be his word against mine years later that this even happened and just looked like he was kipping in my spare room after breaking up with his gf as a favour as he was giving me cash but if in the extremely unlikely event that he ever tries to sue me and claim i was his landlord which would be extremely difficult to both argue and subsequently prove and which i would have no authority to be as id be subletting ill tell the council that he was living there undeclared which is his responsibility to do and get him screwed for council tax that he should have paid whilst he was living there which would with standard legal system interest of about compounded over several years undoubtedly be significantly more than the amount hed get from me 
edit thanks for the gold anon ill use my new powers wisely firstly i apparently suck at reddit formatting so apologies secondly this is probably long ill try to divide it up and put the rest of it in the comments thirdly as far as i know none of this wasis illegal at the time this happened long long ago someone suggested i post it on here so im finally getting around to doing it my sister gave me permission in that i asked her and she said what the fuck is reddit dont send naked pictures to hackers so not that i was planning on it but none of yall are getting naked pictures fourthly my sister is mental as in legit medications needed chronic and lifelong but a great mom we come to this agreement early on in her mental health crises point that no matter how paranoid or awful it is she tells me everything thats going on with her and i can give her feedback with no judgment it works well sometimes i tell her shes right sometimes i tell her shes delusional sometimes i tell her shes being a dick and to knock it off shes told me everything since we were teenagers and to this day it hasnt changed she will motherfucking lie to everyone and shes a good liar dont get me wrong but she wont lie to me because i know when shes lying i call her out on it and we move on we have established this relationship because she needed a coping mechanism for ifwhen she lost touch with reality and she knew she needed one person to trust and keep herself grounded this is before we knew anything about professional psych help we were kids and it still works for us so its all good finally let me state that theirs was a marriage doomed from the start and they both did dick things to contribute to its downfall this is not a story about me taking revenge over some stupid married fight or what not a little background my sister and i are very close i practically raised her so i mamabear the fuck out of any threats to her happiness and safety we had an awful childhood and she my brother and i survived and have close bonds because of it but we didnt leave it undamaged my sister is bi polar and has these crazy paranoid and depressive episodes sometimes shes been on meds for a long time and for the most part they work when she was our ma died and she made a series of shitty life choices which resulted in her marrying her high school sweetheart and having kids in two years one year she had twins he wasnt a bad guy they were just too fucking young so about years go by they are tumultuous years because sister is crazy bil is young and lacks intelligence booksmart but not life smart let me just mention here as a note that regardless of this all they are both very good parents and the kids to this day have no idea what went down and they never will as far as we are all concerned bil through hard work and negligence to his wife and kids not really his fault trying to better himself and generally stupid gets a masters in education while working full time and manages to snag a full time job teaching as a highschool science teacher woo hoo finally that bitch can start getting home on the weekends and evenings and help with the younguns life is good times story of revenge so in the year or two since bil has gotten his teaching gig at highschool her has proven himself to not only be good at his job but immensely popular with students good on him the world needs more good teachers by my sister is unhappy more and more shes confiding to me that she thinks bil is cheating on her turns out the art teacher at the school and he have been cosponsoring a lot of student clubs together and what not he has gotten his ear pierced and started to dress cooler i just let her vent her marriage problems arent mine to solve and being a good sister i stay the shit out of them things start getting weirder bil was hella conservative and religious suddenly he is sponsoring the gaystraight student alliance with the art teacher awesome says me sister is getting more suspicious tells me they keep accidentally running into art teacher when they are out with kids art teacher is married to superintendent and has kids around her boys age the kids like to play together this is happening over the course of a year just so you know not all of a sudden my calls to my sister are getting more frantic im thinking she needs to get her meds adjusted so she does and it calms her down but shes still convinced something is going on they have a lot of text fights at this point they dont argue in front of the kids shit is starting to escalate but being the good sister i stay out of the marriage seriously they could be screwing the entire neighborhood not my problem but i can tell things are escalating shes accusing him of cheating hes calling her paranoid he starts staying out later for student activities this leaves no one to watch the kids so she has to start missing therapy and doctor appointments i step up and call him on it he denies everything and tells me that my sister refuses to go i know this is a lie i dont call him on it i just take note my sister has no family near here my brother and i both live out of state and everyone else is dead or in prison cuz thats how we roll so shes alone out there he puts a passcode on his computer and phone he tells her its because shes crazy and he cant trust her to not delete his things people at her church start shunning her he friends start dropping out of her life she has no idea what the fuck is going on i dont because we dont swing in the same godly circles i think if i stepped into a church id probably combust or something shes starting got get unstable because of all of the weirdness but i can calm her down keep her in check she has no friends left at this point except for me she calls me one day hysterical she says bil has her convinced to go check herself into a psych ward because shes delusional wut i ask her about her delusions and she tells me about things she found on the computer that she imagined like love letters and shit and they arent there now outside i am calm inside i am panicking my sister has been crazy my whole life i know when shes having an episode i can tell by her voice and language she isnt having one now but convinced of it i chat with her to calm her down tell her if she thinks its a good idea i cant stop her but ask if she can wait an extra week because i was flying down the next day to surprise her she agrees we hand up and i buy the next ticket i can get out to go see her and assess the situation bil picks me up and starts going off about my sisters mental break etc inward eye rolling going on but i act concerned something to note ive known bil since he was i can read him like a book i know when hes lying hes scared of me always has been he spends the entire damn week on his best behaviors being the husband and father of the year i know hes up to some shit at this point because this dude is not acting normal my sister fills me in on the details of whats been going on and i have to agree it sounds shady 
growing up i studied on a pretty renowned private school in my neck of the woods public schools here in this part of the world are terrible so the private school business does not cater to the rich like in north america its a requirement for even the middle class of course there are the cheaper ones and the more expensive ones and the one i was in was the most expensive in the region it was pretty hard for my mom to afford it but she busted her ass to be able to provide that to us as the years went by the tuition kept getting more and more expensive so my mom would have to beg for a discount every year bullying was getting more and more intense and the school kept turning a blind eye to it the final straw happened one time i tried to correct a teacher on a grammar error and he went completely apeshit on me sent me to the directors office and ridiculed me throughout the whole year and the school sided completely with him so my mom asked me if i was ok about looking for a new school this was two years before high school ended and i would have to face the big exam to get into a university which is how you get into them around here she went there to give them the news and the schools director said this to her well good riddance see you guys in two years when polanetaryforotdds will have to come back and do some extra courses here so hes able to get into a university implying that i wouldnt make it anywhere without the school i found another school private but cheaper and studied there the remaining two years of high school made lifelong friends in the process studied hard and applied for a test to get into a coveted university on the most contested program results are in passed in first place if that wasnt sweet enough days later we are contacted by the school i studied last they asked me if i wanted to do a commercial that would run on tv and would be plastered all over the city i never talked to the previous schools director again but im pretty sure he remembered the words he told my mom when he saw my giant mug on a billboard advertising for his competitor
this happened a few years ago but its memory always gives me a revenge boner our family home is right in the smack of an open grassland in the outskirts of a midsized city somewhere in the philippines although our neighborhood is sparsely populated small businesses have sprouted all over since it is situated along a main thoroughfare heading to and fro the city center among these is a shithole karaoke bar or videoke in the local parlance this karaoke bar was located right beside the driveway leading to our main gate our house is surrounded by tall concrete walls and adorned by iron spikes on top which is typical in our country it first started out as a small daytime cafeteria usually catering to truck and utility drivers and personnel things were pretty vanilla since it opened and its existence never really bothered us save for the occasional wheeler blocking our driveway a honk or two and they would be moving along later however the management decided to reorganize the place into a cheapass openair bar putting out tables beside the road and extended its operating hours deep into the night along with the revamp came this machine from this is when things began to go bonkers with just a few drops in the coin slot customers can now belt out standards from engelbert humperdinck abba bee gees and frank sinatra alcohol would later up the ante at nighttime a boozers rendition of my way is not exactly my idea for a lullaby this drove my family nuts although most of the time the karaokes decibel level is somewhat bearable inside the house its the murderinducing singing by william hungwannabes that really got into us and adding insult to injury the bar would sometimes put the karaoke on full blast when they feel like it mostly at nighttime my parents first went for the diplomatic approach to address the situation they politely asked the owner a potbellied police officer to at least bring the sound volume down to bearable levels especially at nighttime he initially agreed and things went without a hitch for the next few weeks we later noticed however that the bar had gradually increased the volume until it was back again to preagreement levels even louder than ever when confronted by my mom the asswipe owner just dissed her and said that she is being an elitist who is trying to put him out of business the words he used in our local language is harsher but basically the same idea a few nights after the confrontation the bar was hosting a gathering of a local truck drivers association with beer flowing on the side of the road that damned karaoke is blaring louder than ever this coupled with singing and shouting drunkards created an atmosphere similar to a cornucopia of hyenas and banshees having an orgy this was the last straw for my dad who suddenly flipped from a relatively nice guy into a bastard coated bastard with bastard filling dad later told me he had been plotting this revenge from the time the owner insulted my mom he was just waiting for the right opportunity and motivation to do it he began dismantling our home sound system a component hifi stereo system and told me to set it up on our patio by the garden he went to the storeroom and brought out two very big speakers the type which you often see at parties and other special events wired them into the sound system put on their stands and placed them at our gate as if that was not enough he opened all the doors of our three cars he then told me to come up with perfect song to use and save it in usbs one for the stereo system and three for all the cars with the usbs in hand he then ordered two of my siblings and i to each get into the cars and upon his signal to simultaneously press play and turn the volume at max hironobu kageyamas cha la head cha la began blasting them out of their wits i used the original live english and versions of the song the version was the most badass of them all chilling effectwise it took us four tries before all sound systems became synchronized after our noise barrage started i slowly scadoodled to our gate and saw the same boozer truck drivers who were gleefully singing moments ago now turned sourfaced and constantly making dastardly looks at our direction the karaoke bar owner later approached our gate and angrily demanded that we cease from whatever we are doing the bumpkin even brandished the fact that he is a police officer and can make our lives hell which on a hindsight might have caused real trouble for us out of spite he attempted to topple one of the big speakers from its stand but was a tad too short to reach over our gate my dad the big ol hot and tassy just wryly smirked and went inside the house in less than an hour after our sound cannons blasted the party ended in a puff and some of the customers begrudgingly walked out while hurling invectives my sister insists she even saw two guys pelting stones towards our house much later the karaoke was silenced and the bar closed for the night hours earlier than usual the karaoke bar still continued with its shenanigans after that night albeit never going full retard with karaokes volume again at least during the evening one of the female workers the owners mistress i was told later verbally slandered me a few days later while i was driving out of the house i was a law student when it happened so i used some legal gobbledygook to intimidate the douchebagette instead or so i think we were already planning to commence legal action when it suddenly boarded up about two months later one of its waitresses who used to work for my mom told us that the bar got a bad rap among its regulars remember this place was frequented by truck drivers because of that night word spread and caused business to slow down that and some internal strife within the management eventually led to the bars ultimate demise tldr openair karaoke bar next door is a noisy nuisance dad got totally pissed off one night creates his own sound cannons and blasted the place out of business edit changed blumpkin to bumpkin my yankee stepgrandad often used the latter to peons he hate thought he said the former ho hum googled the former i dont want to get involved in anything scat

throwaway for obvious reasons so i work in a call centre for a mobile phone provider you phone me up i see every last personal bit of detail that youve provided with us especially your phone number on average i would take anywhere from calls each day most of which are not pleasant i understand customers feel irate theyre annoyed and upset im okay with customer shouting at me or getting frustrated because if i was in their position i would be the exact same so i do my best to help say my goodbyes and forget all about you only thing i can do but there are some calls some people who are truly horrible scum of the earth who feel that because there is a network of sound waves between you and them that they are above you better than you that youre not even human and theyre the ones i really hate backstory a month ago i receive from a call from a customer before me she had spoke to an advisor who promised to waive her bill in international charges ps always check the website for your service provider many companies have a maximum charge limited for international rates usually around but they will never tell you this you need to challenge them on it right away i could smell bullshit no one would promised that amount of money because they would never get the authorisation for it i explained to her that i would have to raise a call listening request to see what was agreed upon she came back and said oh no its okay i recorded the call to which she played the recording back to me lo and behold the advisor did promise this but eh whatever she cant use that recording in a court of law and we have no way of verifying that recording so i still had to raise the request i made sure to ask her if shes recording this call she replied no i made sure to warn her that if she was recording the call i was not okay with it and would have to terminate the call she sternly said she wasnt and we carried on talking in the end i advised her the call listening can take working days and if she wanted a separate callback about the issue i can raise that for her now she did so both where processed both of which are handled by separate departments done dusted call over i went on lunch and swiftly forgot about her two weeks later someone on my floor calls me over and says this girl wants to talk to you she said you promised to call her back and that you would credit her account i looked over into the account and its her again i explained to him what happened he could see both requests had been made but have yet to have been picked up which happens a lot unfortunately so he could do nothing else but to raise the issues again with the department and tell her that i would phone her back after pm we close at pm i didnt know he did this at the time but obviously he was trying to fob her off this is a man who ive not once ever in my years working here seen get slightly annoyed yet this girl had him pulling at his hair i watched in awe until walking away to make sure i wasnt caught in the crossfire today i come back onto the floor after my break and someone elses manager walks up to me and says sternly you must take this call i ask why he says my advisor has had this girl on hold for half an hour because she refuses to talk to anyone else she says you promised this that and the other yet nothing has happened she even has a recording of you promising this after some bitching and trying to explain myself the manager had put his foot down and sat me down in front of the phone that was directly linked to satans cumbucket hello youre speaking to op how can i help you where the fuck have you been please dont curse im under no obligation to take this call and im doing it for pure goodwill dont give me that you promised me off my bill and a call back that very day its a month later and nothing has happened im very sorry to hear that but if i do recall i advised you that i would raise a callback not one from myself again im sorry these issues havent been resolved so let my try and fix it for you today bullshit listen to this she then proceeds to play a recording of me promising her money off her bill she had manipulated it poorly to make it sound like i had something i had never done if i do recall i specifically asked if you were recording that call to which you said no so you lied to me and you have a proven history of lying and recording calls so unfortunately im no longer comfortable to take this call anymore have a nice day oh what youre running away because you know im going to put you out of a job sorry scared youre fucking scared her i assumed boyfriend shouts from the background you better be scared we have fucking proof that you lied to us you guys always lie hence why we have to record these calls youll be out on the street without a penny to your name ill make sure of it sorry but as the topic of this conversation now has little releve she cuts over me making blah blah blah noises mocking my obviously foreign accent thats all i hear from you cunts blah blah blah as her and her boyfriend laugh like a pair of elementary school bullies at that point my blood was boiling so i terminated the call without another word now this is where my apology comes into effect this is one customer i could not forget about one customer i could not brush off my shoulder i sought revenge as mention before i had access to her mobile number address heck even her favourite color so i made a note of them all on a bit of scrap paper and tucked it away for later that night i searched the web for every text subscription service i could find bonus points if they charged and signer her up for it i know our policy on these matters third party issue customer will have to deal with the third party charging her so i made sure she where to receive at least chargeable texts each and every day making sure that she would rack up a phone bill with a service provider who will provide no leeway with the payments if she was going to try and scrounge me for that could and would affect my earnings then i was to make sure she didnt have a penny left to her name now its too days later and im completely guilt ridden so im sorry for what ive done im sorry i stooped to your level but good god do i feel good about it
once a week for work i load and unload a mediumsized truck of luggage about eight feet high for cruise ship guests at a threestar hotel the luggage i unload was loaded previously by unionized longshoremen at a nearby dock and the luggage i load goes back to them last week the luggage truck arrived completely full of luggage the thing that sucked about this particular load almost all of the bags were loaded with the wheels facing out making it very difficult to pull bags out of the stack to unload most bags dont have handles at the bottom near the wheels unloading took a lot longer than usual i showed the driver of the truck lets call him joel how it was all stacked as he was helping me and he had my sympathy then he talked about how much he loved delivering luggage for the longshoremen because he cant help unload or load for them because of union rules then the wheels started clicking together we decided to load every piece of luggage with the wheels facing out knowing it would be harder for them it is to unload under those conditions later that day i saw joel at the office and asked how it went this is what he told me as the longshoremen opened the back door they got really pissed off when they saw the bags with wheels facing out the man in charge asked me who the idiot was that loaded all of these bags i quickly replied well i did cause thats how you guys loaded my truck this morning i figured since you guys are the professionals that was the proper way to do it he quickly turned to his workers and barked at them to never load luggage that way again i stood off to the side the whole time smiling to myself while they unloaded the truck 
i can contribute to the hell out of this i was contacted by a client of mine with a problem hed been drunk and partying with some work colleagues and things got a little out of hand he ended up hooking up with someone related to the case he was working on professionally and someone stumbled across them middeed and took some photos very naked very explicit midcoitous worse still this coming to light would have thrown the whole thing in jeopardy the photos ended up on one of those revenge porn sites im not sure whether it was his ex or someone intent on tampering with the case but it didnt matter i emailed the site hosting it and formally requested it be removed the owner responded saying they dont do takedown requests and requested that i fornicate with myself to be expected which was fine because it was step i pulled the whois information for the site to get the name of the company he was using to operate the site then used public records to find out who he was name address phone number home address then used social media to find his personal email address i then used ip lookups to determine the company hosting it i found photos of the girl and set up fake social media accounts for her as a year old girl with enough content that it would appear legit i then contacted the domain registrar and his web host saying that the site contained illegal child pornography and that this served as formal documentation that i had notified them of it used an embedded px transparent png as proof they received it and read it and they had seven days to deregister the domain and delete the site or id be reporting them to the fbi and would be accessories after the fact to the distribution of child pornography i did this on friday afternoon as both the domain registrar and web hosts phone support was only weekdays the site was deleted almost immediately and the domain name suspended minutes later i called him on the phone using the info that id pulled addressed him by name and informed him that i wouldve liked to have made contact again by email but unfortunately his email was not working and neither was his web site and that because of his failure to reply to a reasonable request i had taken it upon myself to have it taken down for me and that it would be in his best interests to pay attention to things i ask for in the future his voice was shaking with a combination of fear and rage next time you to tell someone to go fuck themselves make sure they cant fuck you instead when the site finally reemerged some time the following week my clients sexy escapades had been removed from the site i received a very nice bottle of scotch from the client and logged the work on the ticket as web site maintenance close enough edit thanks op for making me remember this ive added it to rtalesfromtechsupport

this reminded me of me slighty different because i destroyed my exwifes relationship with her entire family when i was married i tried to make it work my ex will have a different story of course but my conscience is clean i worked my ass off so we could get out of debt i was there for her brother and sister when stepdad would go on a bender and hulk out when his frustrations got the best of him i never hit her and i never cheated on her i really truly tried to make it work my ex had cheated on me once before but i sincerely believe that people can change if they really want to she was profusely and abjectly sorry and promised to never do it again i took her apology at face value and life went on i never brought it up again not even in our worst arguments but having been burned i remained vigilant we had moved in with her mom to help out with her familys medical bills but moved out when those were under control and we were finally able to get ahead just a little we had a little bit of disposable income and a little bit more free time for ourselves four years into our marriage i noticed that she was going out a lot with friends work was demanding more of her time she was coming home later and later she was skipping out on eating our meals together classic signs i finally confronted her one day she told me she was going out with friends again i said it was fine when her friends came to pick her up i told her i wanted to meet them oh we have to be somewhere at this time and well just make it if we leave now i consider myself pretty laid back but i took a hard line this time youre not going anywhere until i meet them she knows shes caught she goes out the door and comes back with one guy my heart rate shoots up and i try to keep my rage under control my dad was an oldschool soldier and he taught us discipline you learn discipline real fast when screwing up means you get the belt i have both of them sit down she cant even look at me i straight up ask are you her boyfriend is she your girlfriend guy has a smirksneer on his face what do you think you know that saying seeing red its true i saw red i wanted to get my machete and go to town but discipline you are better than they are i control my breathing take a deep cleansing breath my voice is shaky i point to her you woman if this is how you treat our marriage then i want nothing to do with you i point to the guy you if she can do this to her husband guess what shes going to do to you i point to the door both of you may now leave the guy drops the smeerk off his face because he sees something in mine and both get up and scramble for the door right before it shuts i can hear her yelling at him about how close he came to dying i hear the car peel out a few seconds later i lock the door and collapse down against it ltemotions ensuegt that night she calls me up shes getting her stuff and getting the fo of my life im still messed up so i say yes i tell her ill even stay out while she does this fine she says the next day i go out and do stuff then i go do more stuff just to do stuff when i get home shes taken her stuff shes also taken a shit tons worth of my stuff stuff that was sentimental to me but not to her just to deny me that little bit more happiness thats not right thats just rubbing it in with a rake im stone cold sober now and i begin to plan it takes a week but end result i take her first person i called immediately after i got home was her mom i told mil that we her daughter and i couldnt be together anymore mil tries to get more information but i tell her to get it from her daughter and call me if she needs any more details mil is cussing up a storm not directed at me when i hang up a couple of days later i got a call from her brother who is and built like a brick shithouse this is the guy who told me that if i ever hurt his little sister he would melt my dead body in acid so no one would ever find it bro im sorry about what happened if you need anything just call my mil has ten siblings she told all of them and all of them were solidly behind me even the psycho aunt that nobody else in the family talked to her cousins nieces and nephews called me up to offer support it was immensely gratifying karma about a year later i heard through a friend that bf got her pregnant then dumped her a year after that heard she was pregnant again from a different guy who also dumped her tldr wife cheats on me her family backs me not her
note while some details of this story may seem fantastical this is completely true gentlemans honor i have a friend whose job was to teach english in foreign countries often to adults on this particular job he found himself in saudi arabia he would be teaching english on land owned by a sheikh who was a wealthy community leader before he had come to saudi arabia he heard that this particular sheikh had hired sixty men from bangladesh for some sort of manual labor and had refused to pay them the men had tolerated this for a time but eventually decided to strike nothing violent just a simple sitdown however in saudi arabia striking is illegal so the sheikh deported all sixty men getting months of free labor in the process you can imagine that my friend was on his toes when he reached sa he had been teaching for about a month now and sure enough his payday had come and gone without being paid he had visited the sheikh with his complaints but he would just wave them off saying inshallah which means if god wills it essentially just a way to procrastinate after several more unfruitful attempts to get his money keep in mind his paycheck was only dollars and this man was a multimillionare he was became fed up he visited the sheikhs office receives the customary inshallah and hands him a subpoena turns out my friend had paid a visit to the american embassy and told them what was going on the embassy was concerned and set up a court date now this was especially bad for the sheikh who was friends with the higherups in the american embassy and this would severely damage his reputation but my friend wasnt done there the sheikh was a devout muslim most people in that area were so my friend directly quotes the quran giving verse and chapter saying pay the worker while the sweat is still wet upon his brow this was a major insult to the man and he practically screamed my friend out of his office threatening bloody murder that was phase one the trial came and the sheikh appeared in court it was a relatively simple case and my friend got his money this is where it gets interesting my friend ive said that a lot still had some time left to teach but things were getting pretty ugly and a powerful sheikh is not an enemy you want to have so he decided to hightail it back to the land of the free the catch was that the sheikh had his passport when you live on his land and are paid by him he essentially owns you and it was policy to take the persons passport and only give it back after escorting them to the airport to leave the country so my friend started thinking deviously he called his wife safe in america and asked for one of the families passports once he got it he visited the sheiks office and talked to his secretary or whatever he was the conversation went something like this friend you know you people have cheated me and lied to me and i bet you dont even have my passport secretary of course we have your passport friend so show it to me secretary no i will not show you friend thats because you dont have it you liar eventually he got to see his passport and after much cajoling managed to hold it he then proceeds and i shit you not to rub it all over his body and act like he just found a long lost friend all the while trying to switch it with his daughters passport which was under his leg he made the switch successfully and after having the other passport snatched back with a cry of you crazy american left with his passport victory but he wasnt out of the woods yet he drove to the small house he was living in and packed everything he could into his car he even bundled up the larger items on the roof rack he then hopped in and drove miles to the nearest airport now comes the kicker my friend visited the closest american embassy thank goodness for those and reported a stolen passport that last part had to be all caps because of the magnitude of it remember he had switched passports his daughters passport was now in the sheikhs office and it had no reason to be there the embassy called the sheikhs office and it went down after the formalities embassy do you have the passport of a jane smith obviously not real name sheikh no no we have the passport of a john smith embassy could you just check for me real quick sheikh silencethen muffled arabic cursing gotcha so not only did my friend tarnish this selfish stingy bastards name at the embassy he also framed him for the theft of a passport and the punishment for theft in saudi arabia is dismemberment i humbly pray your forgiveness for any grammatical errors and just to put a few minds at rest he was not dismembered

my former uncle bob was a dead beat why my aunt married him is a mystery he was an alcoholic and a pervert to the extreme he couldnt hold down a job and was a terrible father not only that he was always in the trouble with the law for some reason well this happened quite some time ago think years back in a small town in the middle of no where where the sheriff also had the same high regard for bob well bob was renowned for peeping into bathroom windows for a bit of voyager action however one night he decided hed peep in on my cousin taking a shower not only was this perverted wrong and illegal it was within the family unfortunately for bob my other uncle tom was walking home when he spotted bob grazing through the bathroom window and he could hear the shower running so he knew bob was peeping his daughter well unfortunately for bob tom is quite a large man he works construction for every ounce of strength tom has bob lacks tom grabbed bob and for the next several minutes pummels him into submission punches to the face gut throwing around just a general quality beat down of course this all speculation as the police report was quite different the after math was not pretty broken nose cracked eye socket broken ribs and plenty of blood over both men of course the sheriff who is well acquainted with bob is called in the sheriff arrives a few minutes later and sees bob on the sidewalk obviously in pain and he sees tom its obvious there was a fight so the sheriff walks up to tom and says what happened here tom starts to go off and the sheriff stops and says now tom it appears to me as if bob came over and tripped is that what happened to which tom responded indeed it was the sheriff turned around looked at bob and said bob it appears as if you tripped and fell and im going take you the hospital bob learned his lesson recovered was divorced and we havent seen him since after the divorce he limped around for awhile after that

you need to read them meme as figured you all might enjoy before you wonder maybe she was going slow in the fast lane or maybe she was driving like an idiot i was going in a in the right hand slow lane i had gotten over after passing another vehicle to let the cars coming up behind me pass with out having to slow down i am a considerate driver my low profile lp friend was on the end of line of the cars coming up on me when i got over he wanted to pass them on the right without knowing i was there i suppose that was my fault along with the cars to the right left of me slowing down to my speed due to a cop coming from the opposite direction anywho for about miles extreme tailgating persisted our group of cars got clogged up in stoplights and other traffic of the cars turned off in various directions leaving we get up to a good stretch and back up to speed at this point the guy next to me the original truck in front of him had had enough of him zigzagging between the two lanes tailgating either one of us he would speed up to pass me lp would jump behind him and he would slow down i did remain at a consistent mph so lp would jump behind me etc i noticed the board in the road it was sitting perpendicular across the lanes about in the left lane and s in my lane i had about seconds to decide to be a jackass or not be a jackass i decided on the later former i waited till the last possible second swerved my suv right just as he was going back to the left lane to harass the truck bam he hits it i heard it a satisfactory smile crept across my lips and my truck friend realized what i had done he sped up with lp right on his ass lp rolls down his window flicks me off pulls out in front of me brake checks and speeds off i was expecting all this a quarter mile down the road his flashers go on and he pulls over to the elane with a flat tire i slowed as i went by him rolled down my window smiled and waved tl dr traffic can be frustrating if you drive like a jackass people will treat you as such edit had to change a right to a left see strike through
so this happened over the course of several years backstory i played golf for a university and was fortunate enough to have a scholarship that paid for me to go to school back in the summer of i was arrested for a dui i blew when the legal limit is bac i didnt know any attorneys where i lived went out of state for school but i had a very dear friend that thought he could help me out i was referred to a guy i will call tom name changed i paid tom dollars to handle my dui and he said that was the friends and family discount and i figured i would be in good hands a couple months later being an idiot kid i say kid even though i was at the time i got pulled over again and was driving on a suspended license car impounded ticket etc my coach was not pleased and i was removed from the team to this day i do not blame my coach he made the right decision i ended up having to leave school and move home as i could not afford to stay without my scholarship the above is important because tom being the attorney of record got all of my notices to appear in court and was required to appear on my behalf since i no longer lived in the state over the next couple of years i found out on three or four occasions that i had a bench warrant for my arrest for failure to appear in court i knew nothing about having to appear due to the fact that i was not receiving any of the notices and tom was not showing up to get my simple dui taken care of another year passed and the dui was still not settled i was moving on with my life and had finally got a good job working as a recruiter for a national company life was looking up and i was enjoying the work after about a month at the new job my supervisor pulls me into the conference room and informs me that the company had run its mandatory background check and asks me why there was a bench warrant out for my arrest in another state i inform him of the dui for those that may ask in the application it asked if i had been convicted of any felonies technically the dui was not settled and a first dui is rarely ever considered a felony and he tells me that due to their insurance company not being willing to cover me i would be let go and that day would be my last day i was defeated it had taken me months to get that job and get out of waiting tables i called tom to see what the absolute fuck was going on with my case and how i had yet another bench warrant out for my arrest he dodged my calls for days i started keeping call logs on when i called if i was able to reach him etc but it was to no avail he basically disappeared the revenge i started looking into what it would take to file a complaint with the state bar association this is not a simple process and you have to be able to prove the attorney was negligent in how they were handling your case fortunately my mother was a stringent records keeper for matters like this and had the call records for the last several months along with the minimal documentation contracts etc from when we hired tom we filled out what seemed like an endless supply of forms for the complaint and sent everything we had to the state bar association it took several months but once the bar association looked into the case they wrote to inform me that they had suspended toms license from practicing law for years in that state and he would not be able to appeal it for years they also refunded me the that i had paid him which went to hiring a new attorney the new attorney was great and was able to get the matter resolved within months but she did tell me that when she appeared before the judge he was visibly upset at me due to how tom had handled the case i was not given any leniency and got maximum fine amounts and years unsupervised probation all totaled it took almost years to get my dui case settled in court my probation has been over and done with for a while but i still smile knowing that tom is still unable to work in his primary profession and for those wondering i do still drink but when i do i drink responsibly and take a cab tldr dont do your job which results in getting me fired from mine i will make sure you cant work in your profession for years 
ive debated if this counts as pro revenge since i literally didnt have to do anything but i think itll still fall under the category ive mentioned in a past post dont wish bad on others wish good on yourself this is a prime example after college the recession had started up and jobs were severely limited i ended up taking an entry level call center job for retirement plans which is quite possibly the worst hell you can imagine i was talking to yr old women during the stock market plummets and had to tell them what happened to their life savings it was heart shattering you also experience the worst of the genetic toilet and thats where this one caller ill name big mac falls in i was called at am by an older man who demanded to speak with my friend who was a manager in training my friend wasnt going to be in until am so i told him and offered to either transfer to his voicemail take a message and email him personally or transfer him to whatever manager was available ill call my friend bob big mac youre not listening im telling you to transfer me to bob right now me i understand you want to talk to bob but he doesnt get in for another half hour its literally physically impossible to transfer you big mac or bm didnt comprehend this stating it was absurd that he was on vacation in florida he lived i think in jersey and he had to call and couldnt talk to bob and just kept bitching in general i offered numerous times to help him myself or any of the other options i gave him earlier he became more irate bm now you listen to me you make sure bob calls me before he has his first cup of coffee do you understand me me ok staying calm i mentally checked out on this dude after the rd time explaining bob wasnt there bm now listen very closely if bob doesnt call me when he gets in im going to my local mcdonalds and shooting up the place and im going to blame your company and me sir sir were on a recorded line i really ask you not to joke about murder bm you have no idea how serious i am at the exact moment i spokebob was walking by me me ok we hung up within seconds me i really hope i never have to deal with a dude like that again heres where the wish comes into play bob that guy sounded pleasant nowwhats this about joking about murder i told him and within minutes they called bms local police and arrested him in jersey calling from florida huh the police later told me when they arrested bm he was yelling that he was going to sue the cops his town and state my company and most of all me for slander he continued to yell and deny until he was sat down in the police station and was played the phone call the cops tell me bm immediately burst into tears and begged for forgiveness and that he didnt mean it this was immediately minutes after he maintained his stance on denying allogations and suing everyone i ended up talking to bm once more two weeks later much more sheepish than before and ended the call by telling me how much he appreciated my service he recognized my name and voice and knew i was the same guy like i said dont wish bad on others wish good on yourself if a wish comes true one helps you more than the other plus karmas a bitch
ive heard this story from a few sources it seems though that over the years the number of people that claim that they were actually in the truck at the time have increased to circus clown car proportions when i asked him about it mark not his real name said he was driving his pickup full of friends in a grocery store parking lot when a car abruptly backs out forcing him to stop short then after snailing along for about s a man exiting the store yells out hey angela how are you this lady proceeds then to actually stop her car exit the vehicle and leave her car door open blocking both lanes of the parking lot now to go visit with her friend after about steps mark yells out hey angela how about you come back here and move your car she turns around and asks how do you know my name he replies i just heard that guy yell it over there now how about moving your car a vehicle has also pulled up behind him so he cant even back out now she goes oh fuck you you asshole then walks over to her friend and begins chatting with him my friend stews for a moment and then guns his truck right through her driver side door ripping it off its hinges he yelled fuck you too angela as he peeled out of the parking lot tldr lady blocks parking lot with her open car door friend drives through said door like a crazy person
 english is not my first language ignore the grammar issues please tldr version was very good friends with boss and female coworkerfriends they had an affair together and took my honesty and friendship and respect and shoved it in my face i got back by waiting a full year and ratting them out to their spouses causing them to get divorced wall of text version so a few years ago i worked at a fortune company i was there on a contract everything was great really liked the team boss paul was great he and i could talk about anything honestly as two guys hes been to my house ive been to his his wife is funny and a stayathome mom if it wasnt for the bosscontractor thing we could be bros outside of work at some point there is a new woman contractor mary that starts on the team she sits in the cube next to me shes married pretty hot a little bit flirty just generally great too talk to she and i hit it off right away we become pretty close texting each other at night about work and family and just general shit every now and then she throws some random comments out there about me coming over to her place which from a selfesteem point of view was just a big plus in my book never took her up on it but could have we have our normal disagreements about how to run stuff complete tasks etc and while those got heated it was just two strong willed people having differing opinions no big deal she becomes a family friend our kids play together families go to events together etc fast forward to about months later i am chatting with my boss late at night project cutover he mentions that he is jealous how mary and i can fight and clear the air and just move on i thank him for the compliment and didnt think anything of it well within a couple of weeks bossman and mary are doing lunch together constantly i ask him if i should move out of the way as it is obvious that he likes her remember i am there on a contract so my boss can fire me without a reason that why i treated him with deference he says no life goes on for another couple of weeks this way then he puts her on his pet project all of her time is now allocated to his stuff he doesnt have time for the rest of the team as all of his attention is focused on his project i am sure you can see where this is heading it was quite obvious to the entire group that they were having an affair the entire group was up in arms about this because this new girl is getting all of the bosss attention getting perks etc same old story that you have heard about before needless to say i too am upset i am losing my bff i figured we were friends enough to keep being friends even through her affair obviously not what bugged me about the entire thing is that i told my boss who was also a friend that his affair with her was ruining my work relationship and my personal relationship with mary he denied to my face that they were having an affair which was such bs because i overheard him talking to her on the phone saying how he wanted to come over to her place for one of their status meetings and make out with her side note there were also a couple of photos of them that were taken by people on the team one was taken in the office at a group celebration for someones birthday in the background you can see them in his office with his hands on her ass and another one where the team was out to a concert everyone was drinking people finally noticed that they disappeared one of the women in the group took a pic of them kissing in his car of course i didnt tell them about these pictures during our talk fuck him and her less than a month later we do a shuffling of cube locations to better align the people who work on projects together i am moved to a deserted island no one around me handwriting is on the wall one month after that i am ccd on an email to my contracting firm informing them that my last day will be weeks from that email so through this whole thing my friend just quit hanging out and i get why didnt give a shit anymore pretty much just dumped me as a friend i didnt like it i tried to ask her why to see if she would say anything at all no dice her allegiance was to paul now i told her that i was upset she told me she didnt care and didnt have time for me fuck it if you want to have an affair go for it the whole affair part didnt bother me too much i will admit to some envy there but i am not going to sacrifice everything i have for some ass just not worth it to me what bothered me was the lack of respect that they both showed me i was pretty honest with both of them about what the team was saying how everyone was feeling etc what they did was take my honesty and use it so that they could cover up their affair better for example when i said that people were noticing that she would leave and then paul would get his coat on and leave within min he started leaving his coat in the office and leaving about min after her when i said that people noticed that he was giving gifts to her and not to the group then all of a sudden the group started getting stuff too crap like that what was funny in a fucked up way is that about months after i was gone she started being friendly again random how are you my day sucked texts anyway i moved on workwise still texted her every few days after she started texting me again nothing major just pleasantries i liken the ups and downs of our friendship to being rich then being poor i would much rather be rich again who doesnt right but that anger was still inside me because of how vulnerable i made myself to her and how i felt i was used so i resolved to get even i waited a full year and heard that she had accepted a full time position with my former boss i then sent an anonymous email to his wife letting her know about the affair and giving her details and the proof the pictures too mary of course called me so did my former boss he was pissed i told both of them that i did not do anything how could i i have been gone for more than a year i dont know anything about your life anymore fuckers i heard that both of them got tossed out of their homes and are getting divorced they deserve each other moral of the story if you are going to have an affair be discreet and keep your friends close or have the balls to say i dont want to be friends anymore and not be a passiveaggressive douchebag because if not they may become your enemy and might be even more passiveaggressive and look for revenge did it make me feel better that i did it fuck yes ill be around if you have questions this is a throwaway account so feel free to ask or criticize or whatever 
didnt know this sub existed so cross posting now this began approximately weeks ago and culminated last saturday two of my friends from college now stay close and live in the same city since we graduated we all stayed close by hanging out drinking and most of all by pulling pranks on each other it started as rather innocuous escapades changing out someones entire apartment furnishings with ugly curbside furnishingsthift store moving each others cars while we were at work etc of course a sort of escalation came into play with the pranks becoming more elaborate and slightly twisted the two of them hired a transvestive to agressively hit on me at a bar we frequent and then payed her to stalk me for a week it always made for good laughs most of the time at this point i should introduce the two devient bastards i call friends grard as we shall call him is from a well off family and kind of a dick and edmond is a bit more reserved and busts his ass working at the county morgue i only give the background on them because it is sort of integral to what happened leading up to a few months ago grard started becoming a little too aggressive with pulling one over on edmond to the point where it was painfully obvious that things were getting a little too mean spirited we talked about it a few times and grard always just played it off like it was no big deal however the pranks continued and just the generally verbal ribbing he gave edmond was just too much for the guy to take after work one day edmond and i are drinking bourbon at my house and he tells me that he is sick of grards shit he then lays out his devious plan to put him in his place i realizing the amazing crown jewel that he has plotted agree to assist a few weeks later the three of us are at the bar and this beautiful blonde comes over and starts falling all over grard unbeknownst to him it is actually a cousin of edmond who had been enlisted to the plot she eggs on to drink vigorously until the bar kicks all of us out we already planning to stay with at grards place due to his close proximity to that part of town get back and keep him drinking at this point the poor fellow is blackout drunk and it doesnt take long for him to pass out with his head in the toilet collectively we move the victim into his bed and get to work edmond and his cousin begin applying makeup to her first they take her down to her underwear and then apply a very pale foundation to her entire body she takes on a very palor appearance before edmond places a fake neck wound from a costume store on her neck next edmond bring in a cooler with several pints of real fucking blood at this point i didnt even want to know the hows or whys but i kept rolling with it after a few hours of waiting around all of our nerves frayed from waiting by his door hoping he did not wake up and throw a wrench into out plans we laid the finishing touches edmonds cousin crept into grards room and played in his bed edmond then cut open the blood bags and covered grard the girl and a kitchen knife from grards kitchen of course at this point the sunrise had fully illuminated the room when i left and edmond stayed behind suddenly i hear edmond cry out grard what the hell have you done an audible groaning could be heard from the bedroom as the still drunk grard started out of his slumber followed by a stream of expletives from the newly faux murderer i rush into the room on cue to release my own stream of expletives and to grab grard no reason to give him too much time to contemplate the situation i usher him into the living room and sit him down to calm him down right now would have been the perfect time to end this charade and make it a story we could all have laughed about however edmond was not done with his prey he comes out of the bedroom to tell grard that the girl is dead the hysterics coming from our murderer are endless edmond kneels down to eye level and slaps him across the face and tells him to get it together because he is going to have to call the police grard reacts to this by freaking out and begging the two of us not to do that masterfully edmond pretends to deeply contemplate the poor mans pleas and then says i can take care of this for you but you have to commit to it never say a word about this to anyone ever i on cue again escort grard to the shower take his clothes and tell him to clean all traces of blood from himself edmond and i then go inside of the bedroom and wrap his cousin into a blanket as we hear grard exit the shower we pick up the girl and carry her to the bed of my pickup truck with a cover outside when he sees us carrying the mass of cloth and body he freaks out into hysterics again i we spend the rest of the morning cutting up carpet moving the mattress and bleaching walls and floors all the while stopping to console our terrified friend at many a point we could have stopped and revealed our ruse to grard and perhaps we should have however edmond was not yet done with him the following weeks were not good for grard the three of us hung out still but no longer did we go out and the would be murderer constantly checked the news for a missing person or a body turning up somewhere he once pressed edmond for details of what we did with the evidence only to be met with a stern its better if you didnt know fast forward to last saturday evening with the three of us sitting in grards living room he begun coming out of his state of shock and would talk to us more about the normal things we guys bullshit about on a regular night coincidentally it was also the night that edmond layed his final stroke after finishing a beer grard stood up and turned to get another from the kitchen other end of the house where a pair of glass doors lead out to the back deck standing on the deck was none other than edmonds cousin in her blood stained pallor with a cheap faux neck wound staring back at him instantly the haunted victim began pointing and screaming to which edmond and i started uncontrollably laughing grard was too enshired in his fear to notice our reaction for several minutes as he continued his hysterical response curled up on the floor at this point the game was finished we let the would be spectre into the house and explained the masterfully laid prank on our friend instantly the fear turned to rage and he threatened to kill us as he ran the three of us out of his house neither edmond or i have been able to get grard to talk to us since tldr we made our friend think he killed someone and then haunted him with his perceived victim notes i do not know the origin of the blood i do know from my experience growing up on a farm that the blood passed the cursory olfactory test i do not go into detail about why gerard deserves this mostly because i do not have edmond consent for that it does cross work and family boundaries that we all had until recently respected
us army i was in advanced training where you go after basic training to learn your actual job and there was a problem individual in our barracks bay room of beds he was being discharged for failure to adapt and was prolonging it as long as possible to milk the pay he was getting from the army which he kept referring to as the easiest job hes ever had the bay had bunk beds and one single bed he got the single bed because nobody wanted to be near him he did stuff like the following walked around claiming to be black clearly not to groups of black soldiers because his adopted mother is black used nigger as a greeting to black soldiers while flashing what he probably thought were gang signs but looked like he was having a seizure walked around with his laptop on his shoulder playing rap music from it like it was a s boombox talked loudly in his sleep mostly creepy sex stuff including the names of specific soldiers in the bay incessantly bragged about how he could kick everyones ass but screamed for the drill sergeant like a child crying for mommy if anyone got physical with him all that crap we could ignore because he was on his way out and we thus had no responsibility to try to help him improve but one thing he wouldnt do was secure his locker hed always leave it unlocked and the whole bay would get punished for having an unsecured locker hed also throw a raging fit if you closed his lock when he wasnt around because you touched his stuff as such we never referred to him by name he was simply the douchebag i was one of the brainy soldiers so the drill sergeants would pull me off of the work details to do paperwork for them i didnt mind trading hours of gardening in the sun for hours of paperwork in an air conditioned office i probably would have done better in the air force than i did in the army while doing paperwork i overheard that there was going to be a full locker dump inspection the next morning that night i went to the little convenience store across from the barracks and made an unusually large purchase from the hygiene aisle the next morning the drill sergeants storm through the barracks room by room dumping the contents of everyones lockers to check for contraband mine is dumped of course no problems my bunkmates is dumped no problems then its time for the douchebags locker at first its trash he was too lazy to actually throw his trash away so he just threw it on top of his other stuff candy wrappers youre not supposed to eat in the barracks empty tiny bottles of alcohol drinking not allowed in training dirty clothes so nasty the drill sergeant kept rubbing his hand on his pants after touching them with each infraction the drill sergeant gets angrier and louder but the douchebag knows that if they try to give him serious punishment that hell be there even longer the drill sergeant then grabs the backpack hanging on the locker door pulls it open and turns it over on the bed out spill a halfdozen douches half of them new in their box and half of them out of the box with their contents emptied the drill sergeant stops yelling midsentence and just stares the douchebag is confused until he picks one up of the packages and reads what it is he explodes hes screaming that theyre not his hes throwing the bottles at other soldiers who are at parade rest waiting for their locker inspection ripping the sheets off his bed and hes even kicking his own stuff on the floor the drill sergeant just watches as he ragingly stomps on the stuff on the floor in his tempertantrum up until the moment he realizes he just brought his foot down through his laptop then his rage turns to despair as he cradles this laptop like its a dying child crying and screaming in full meltdown the drill sergeant watches for about another minute then loudly says carry on and exits the bay and no he didnt start securing his locker after that
making a throwaway for this had to get it off my chest to someone after so many years where do i even begin my parents were immigrants from latvia dad was a physicist he passed away when i was my brother and since then mom struggled to earn for our living it was rough before that mom was a housewife taking care of us full time so she had no big education or work experience so she turned to cleaning cooking and babysitting for our neighbors in the community after some time we couldnt afford to pay rent on time and thats when i realized that we are in trouble because the landlord was coming and shouting at my mother she was crying it happened several times i helped as much as a kid can i guess but that was not enough to keep us fed amp bring money after several angry visits the landlord came with a friend they were both drunk and they beat up mom and forced her to have sex saying that they will harm me and my little brother it was the most terrifying moment of my life mom was hysterical and crying and didnt stand up for the rest of the day we were crying with her and didnt understand what and why had happened the landlord said he will come back after a week he did that for over a year coming back once or twice a week alone or with his friend they didnt shout or beat mom up any more and they locked me and my brother in the toilet so that we didnt see anything but mom was crying very long after each time they came mom was starting to get crazy then she was talking to herself and crying several times during the day some time passed like this and the landlord began staying overnight mom acted really crazy she would beg him to stay in the morning made him breakfast and all and gradually he was living with us my mother treated him like dad and i had to pretend that i like him because every time he didnt like my behavior he would make mom shout and cry at night my brother doesnt remember our dad at all so our stepfather likes him more than me anyway back to the point to make this whole mess even more rough our stepfather has seizures sometimes especially when hes drinking and doesnt take his medicine or vomits the tablets it happens sometimes during those times he is unconscious for like minutes and dancing all over the floor anyway he doesnt remember anything so when i was years old i had so much hate for him boiling in me that i was planning ways to kill him before going to sleep but i was afraid of doing anything like that which would destroy our family even more so i was secretly dreaming of harming him and this was especially strong when he was drunk or unconscious i remember this like it happened today he came back home drunk late at night we were all pretending that we are sleeping to avoid trouble although he was very loud and stumbling amp banging on everything at nights like this we were just silently hoping that he would collapse and sleep and do no harm and he did after waiting the safe amount of time i was able to go to the toilet to pee which was good in times when he was not drunk enough me and my brother peed into empty soda bottles to avoid going to the toilet so when i went to the toilet to pee i saw him there he was on the floor lying in his vomit with pants down and having a seizure i was petrified i thought he was sleeping with mom but instead of waking mom up i took a needle which he always used for picking his teeth and i stabbed him in the balls i dipped the needle in his vomit and stabbed his balls for more than minutes i made sure that his vomit got into his balls after that i put the needle back on the sink and went back to sleep feeling excitement and relief of course he didnt remember anything the next day but he was very very angry and sore and accused mom that she hit him in the balls when she was transporting him to bed in the morning he stayed in being very pissed after i came back from school i found out that the friend drove him to the hospital well it turned out he got testicular gangrene sepsis amp came back from the hospital several weeks later without balls and lacking a big chunk of meat around the area those weeks were the best weeks of my life also he stopped drinking after this but he never stopped being an abusive asshole until he died when i was never told anyone not even my brother edit first of all thank you for not judging for what i did i have had enough mental problems when i was a kid i thought that i was a monster for what i did fortunately the situation got much better when our stepfather came back from the hospital he stopped drinking was less aggressive and didnt disappear for days and come back beating us and mom this helped me a lot to justify what i did but again i was not aware of the possible consequences when enacting my spontaneous revenge i wanted to give him pain and a swollen sack while he barely made it alive from what the doctors were saying the doctors never told him about the needle marks i think because of the swelling i never got to see it but the friend driving him to the hospital told us that it looked like a plum the size of a grapefruit he died of unrelated reasons when i was after he stopped drinking food became his new addiction and he got really obese quickly he had a fatal stroke as for his friend i never wanted revenge on him because when our stepfather disappeared sometimes for days long he came to us gave mom food and money he helped us to get through the rough times i always thought that he was the good guy at least in comparison to our stepfather as for myself i am doing fine thank you for asking i am happily married my wife also was a victim of childhood abuse so we understand each other on a level impossible for normals out of fear for reenacting the past my wife and i made the decision to sterilize did that last year so no children possible for us and thats fine i often wonder how would my life go if my father hadnt died id probably be a physicist or something im working shifts but now that all is fine i think i can better appreciate this small fine life i have with my wife all good stepfather burn in hell
using a throwaway for this its long so i hope its at least entertaining for you all i work in it for a large company a year ago we were a bit short staffed so we finally picked up a new coworker well call him chad when i saw chads resume there were a few red flags for example he had close to different jobs in the past years for the first few days everyone was ok with him but after a few shifts we noticed a pattern he would constantly browse gaming sites go home for lunch so he could play with his games which was fine since its his lunch break anyway and after coming back from break he would have his ipad with him so that he can watch twitch after business hours we work hour shifts and the datacenter is pretty dead around pm he was a pure video game addict dont get me wrong i am ok with people slacking off but i at least want them to learn how to do their job first so that they can be of help when needed for the first months my team tried our best to train him but he was way more focused on gaming than actually learning the job he never retained anything we taught him because he just wasnt interested my team kept telling our manager about his lack of progress but our manager just chalked it up to us doing a horrible job of training him when chad was months into the job he still didnt know how to do the basics that most people already pick up by the first week and our manager still refused to fire him most assumed that he didnt have the balls to pull the trigger on it at that point our team was already so fed up with chad that we just ignored him and gave up training him our team is so we cover for holidays but the company only wants staff members max for holiday shifts because they dont want to pay too much overtime when the next holiday shift was coming up i volunteered for it with another coworker i love the overtime pay and plus i didnt want chad to work it because if something did blow up he would be useless i worked holidays alone with chad before and i did all the work really frustrating this didnt sit well with chad though and he brought it up to me he told me it wasnt fair that i was working more holidays than him and he wanted to work this next one he also brought it up to my manager and i was pretty much forced to let him have it i saw the smug look on his face as he rejoiced in his triumph but deep down that was the last straw for me i didnt believe that this guy deserved to get overtime pay for a shift that i know he wont be lifting a finger for so i felt like i had to get my revenge i started browsing his facebook page to try to dig up dirt on this guy and turns out his fb was a goldmine the guy always complained about work and made his status updates public so that i could see it without even being his friend here are a few that i found once i found these i forwarded screenshots to my coworkers and that eventually reached my manager this woke my manager up and he was finally on a mission to get chad fired the only tricky part was that chads facebook name was fake and he had no pictures of himself in his profile the only reason i knew it was his facebook was because i always saw him on it during work my manager decided to take a stab anyway and had a on meeting with chad and showed him the facebook page and asked him if it was his as we predicted chad denied it all after that meeting my manager gave me the update that we dont have enough evidence to fire him i was so close to getting him that i didnt want to let this bastard slip through i searched his fb even more found his wifes fb page and sure enough her pictures were also public and it had quite a few pictures of chad tagged with his fb profile nailed him my manager brought up the pictures and chad had no choice but to admit it was him he even had the balls to say to my manager the only reason i lied about my fb page the first time was because i wanted to protect you my manager just incase this would bring trouble from hr he was fired on the spot felt so good the aftermath my manager still had to deal with chad a few times via email afterwards apparently after chad got fired he sent an email to my managers boss saying how my manager made my team gather the evidence so that chad can get fired before he moves to the us we didnt even know he was moving to the usa infact he always said how he hated that country so it was a surprise to us he also sent an email to my manager about how he found out he has cancer and since he doesnt have a job he cant afford the medical bills for it not sure if chad was just lying about that to make my manager feel bad but i wouldnt put it past him bonus picture here is a status of him complaining about other peoples laziness when he himself is the laziest bastard i have ever worked with tldr useless coworker forced me to step down from working for overtime pay i dug up dirt from his fb to get his ass fired

my grandfather owned a rather large farm in a small farming community he always got along well with the neighbors that is until jim moved in jim was someone that my grandfather had known from his time on a nearby police force jim had approached him and asked him to sell a small parcel of land to build a house on it was an inconvenience as my grandfather owned the land on three sides of this but he grandfather accepted and jim started to build fast forward a few years my father and grandfather continually found garbage dumped on their land later that summer they also caught jim digging a duck blind in the middle of their field that was the beginning of the end for the relationship after several attempts of my grandfather being civil and jim continuing to dump garbage things were getting worse it all came to an end one day when my father was driving through the field in a new combine and drove it right into another duck blind that jim had dug now my grandfathers farm wasnt just for growing plants he also had a few hundred pigs and a few thousand hens he picked my father up in the field and drove to the manure at the back of the farm im not sure how many of you are familiar with a liquid manure spreader but they have the ability to coat anything and everything within a radius behind the unit with a very thick and very smelly coating of shit well my grandfather loaded the spreader full then just to make sure it stuck in place broke a few bales of hay into the spreader he proceeded to back the tractor and spreader up to the property line at jims back yard and let loose by the time he was done he had done this on all three sides of jims property and left a four inch thick coating of shit cemented in place with the hay around the entire property it was that bad that jim had to pack up and lived at a campground for the entire summer eventually he moved and had to sell the land back to my grandfather at a fraction of what he bought it for tldr was a duck blind worth four inches of cemented shit
i used to live in a tiny studio apartment in a really shitty neighborhood with very thin walls and stupid neighbors one of them had a girl over every now and then and he made her presence known to all he had his bed against the wall my bed was against every time she was there his headboard would repeatedly smack against my wall worse this dude had some serious stamina so my boyfriend and i had to listen to this for hours when i approached my neighbor about this he said there were pillows behind the headboard so that couldnt be him he offered to show me and sure enough he did have pillows stuffed behind the headboard they were on the floor the top of the headboard was hitting our shared wall not the part bolted to his bed frame he insisted this was enough and that would be the end of it now im not going to pester my property manager over my horny neighbor but im not going to start a band and use his headboard for tempo either this had to stop but how a while later i was watching a video on youtube where someone had dubbed yakety sax over horrible things to make them funny the boyfriend saw this and asked why dont we use this on the neighbor that man was a genius so we cued up the stereo with a copy of the benny hill theme set the volume as high as it would go and turned it off armed and ready sure enough as we start falling asleep he starts up fire the first round we blast the music he stops we turn it off and enjoy the silence he didnt get the hint he started up again louder and more aggressive enthusiastic than before fire the cannons this time around we were laughing hysterically the boyfriend called it the soundtrack of their love that musical cold shower ended all our problems the nearby apartments were really pissed until they heard the story it propagated though the entire building that neighbor never brought another woman home
so this happened sometime ago when i was riding shotgun driving with my dad down a throughway it was a lane throughway that has a speed limit of mph my dad was going about mph and would go into the left lane to pass slower cars then he would get back into the right lane we come up to this truck that is either doing the speed limit or going slightly over so my dad pulls into the left lane again to pass and then right when we are about neck and neck with this truck this woman in a big ol suv comes like a bat out of hell and is behind my dad she starts honking the horn and you can tell she is losing her shit being behind my dad i think what made my father mad was how all of a sudden this woman was going off the deep end tailgating flashing her brights honking the horn what i found weird was my dad decided to just match the speed of the truck next to him the revenge he stayed at the same speed as this truck for about a mile or two this lady going bat shit the entire time i asked my dad why he was doing this and why he didnt just pass the truck and let this woman be on her way and out of her life he looked at me and said son it is not ok for people to act like that now at this point there is a long line of cars in the left lane behind my dad he slows down a little as if to have the truck on the right pass him as soon as this crazy lady see this she switches lanes my dad speeds up and takes a whole train full of cars with him as everyone passes this lady who is now stuck in the right lane not the best revenge story but it was just cool how calm my dad was and made that lady learn a little patience
firstly i have no idea if this story is true or not it was told to me by a girlfriend i had years ago either way it makes for a good story she used to live in a town where in the fall people would rake their leaves into a big pile on tuesdays and then on wednesday morning a big truck would come around and suck the leaves up and take them away some dumbass local teens had taken to driving around town on tuesday nights and driving through the leaf piles spreading them everywhere and making a big mess after having it happen to her a few times she apparently took matters into her own hands she raked up all the leaves one tuesday and then placed a few cinder blocks into the pile so they could not be seen sure enough at some point later that night she could hear their car and hootinghollering driving up the street into the leaf piles and when they got to her pile she heard a loud bang and someone yell what the fuck she peeked out her window to see one of the teens getting out and inspecting the damage before screaming to his buddies about the fact that his dad would kill him for the damage to the car which apparently belonged to his dadafter which he got in the car and drove off slowly she found bits of fender in the leaves the next day oh and apparently it never happened again
if this is better for petty revenge just let me know and i will move it but i thought it was better here this was years ago when i was a supervisor at a grocery store and as you know people love to park in the fire lane for who knows what reason i am guess entitlement or lazy for our store this posed a few problems one it was getting in the way of us bringing in carts from outside and two is that we had a drive thru for our pharmacy and people where getting in the way of that too i even had a car park in the drive thru but that is a different less satisfying story there are signs saying this is a fire lane and dont park there ok time for the story one day i was checking our cart situation when a car pulls into our fire lane and gets very close to our doors this is bad because i dont want our cart guys accidentally hitting his car when they bring carts in and you know the whole illegal part i see him get out and come in through the door i am standing by i ask him please dont park your car there it is in the fire lane his response was to stare at me and just continue walking ok fine i gave you a chance i inform my coworker working the service counter to call the police and inform them someone has parked in a fire lane i inform the manager as well and i have told him the authorities have already been called it takes min for the police to show up the officer pulls up behind the car and my cart person comes and grabs me to tell me the police have shown up as i am walking out the door guess who shows up thats right the driver and he sees the police car right behind his and the officer less than ft away that i was walking out to talk to so what is his response now that this is happening his response and i am directly quoting faggoty ass bitch i am not happy about but i say nothing believe me i wanted to say something i head back in and inform the manager what just transpired when in comes the officer he would like to speak to me alone i really had no idea what was wrong or if i was in trouble did i do something wrong by wasting his time or some other thing well it turns out that the officer heard his comment and was planning on giving him a disorderly conduct ticket for his language i want to say also for him parking in the fire lane but i fail to see how that relates to traffic he asks me if this is ok i ponder this for a moment because i dont want to head to court if i have to testify or some such thing but then the words he said pop back into my head and i agree to give him the ticket here is the kicker the officer continues to inform me that he cant do anything about the kid in the car but he said he will inform the driver that he will mention this in his log and it will be seen by social services i was not expecting that i look over at the window to see the car and sure enough there is a kid about or in the back seat now jumping up and down my only guess is that the kid was asleep when i first saw the car holy crap that far out weighs the parking in a fire lane or the car getting hit by carts one of the customers later came up to me to thank me for calling the police because she saw that kid was left alone in the car i told her i didnt know but i would have called if i had seen that as well pets too the officer leaves and i go back to work and relieve my service counter worker to go on break less than minutes later the driver walks in and walks by the service counter and gives me the death stare all i could think was i just wanted you to park your car in a normal spot crap and now thinking back on that he still didnt have his kid i should have call the police again smacks head
i got some pa loudspeaker horns to battle my neighbors dog after being rudely awoken way too early for a few weeks in a row well i decided to record my neighbors dog during one of these sessions i then went ahead and got four speaker horns from craigslist and set them up pointed towards my neighbors house i then played the recording of my neighbors dog barking for them one early morning for about an hour have not heard the dog since he is still there but somehow the neighbors magically seems to have a better handle on the barking 
not sure if this belongs here but ill try wanted to post this early but had a crazy end of the month so i run a fairly large dealer network as many of you know and because of this i have quite a bit of capital at my disposal well ive been in this business since i was ive been around the block more than a couple of times ive also been ripped off before and know how to protect my business im no slouch so dont try and pull a fast one on me i also believe that a man word is as solid and binding as a written contractat least it was when i started well one day i get a phone call its henry henry is a smart bright intelligent young man from a fairly successful family heck henry used to work for me before his family decided to invest in him and buy his own dealership thats all well and goodgood for your henry well henry calls me up and after a bit of small chit chat henry says that he has an excellent deal for me and would like for me to purchase a large quantity of his stock i however am a bit overstocked on used vehicles at that moment and politely said im not all that interested in buying any more stock henry then confided into me he got himself in some sort of legaltax problem and needed an influx of cash to pay out a settlement or his dealership would get foreclosed on now i felt bad for henry he explained more in detail on how he got in trouble and now had to pay the price well he had about a vehicles in stock and wanted to make about k in cash and was willing to part when some pretty good vehicles at very solid wholesale pricing well fine lets see what he has finding reconditioned vehicles at a good price is always hard and helping out a fellow dealership is always a good thing i told henry id stop on by and check out what he has on the lot so i did i found in total about vehicles in which i wanted to purchase for my used car inventory and i advised henry of this we came to an agreement those specific vehicles for giving henry more than enough capital to take care of his problem plus some extra cash on top honestly the deal wasnt that great of a bargain for me but hey i wasnt going lose on this one i also felt really good about giving henry a helping hand we agreed he said he needed to prep them and id pay for the transport back to my dealership i however insisted on i would pay once the vehicles were delivered and not before he was actually a bit peeved at this stipulation i then reminded him that the cash was not a problem and he knew this so he relented all is well and done and a few days later we start the transfer and when everything is said and done my used car mgr calls me up and tells me henry only sent over when the truck driver who knew i had purchased vehicles had brought this to henry attention he said i knew what was going on and everything was ok well everything was not ok and a car deal is not a small deal and i am most certainly going be checking in on thisnow i figured henry sold of the vehicles to customersthats ok we will just lower our agreed upon purchase price i take his and we are done so i called up henry i expected the phone call to be pretty simple hey henry i got vehicles we need to agree to a new price let me just deduct what those vehicles where worth and ill wire that over keep in mind we didnt have a contract saying ill pay x for y but i did have a list of vin numbers henry bulked at this said we had agreed on those vehicles for k i balked right back and said hes being unreasonablei was very upset at this point cause this man was honestly trying to pull such a stupid fast one on me i then told henry deal is off you can come and pick up your vehicles well of course he was having cash problems and it costs money to transport vehicles so those vehicles sat in my back lot for awhile when eventually his dealership went bankrupt and everything went up for auction i hoped on over and bought out his entire stock for a fraction of what it was worth it was quite a significant windfall for us and our sales people where more than happy to sell them now the story isnt over just yetthere is one more nail to be hammered in this coffin my owner bought a dealership several months after this fiasco i of course was in charge of this dealer as i was all the dealers in this owners network so here i am inside the dealership getting a feel for this place when henry walks in i was in a back office henry approached a sales person asked for a manager and told the manager he was an experienced sales person looking for a sales persons job of course henry did very well in the interview with the sales manager and the manager called me up advised he had a great hire and wanted me to give a quick once over i said to bring him on in there i am sitting in my office when their is a knock on my door i say come in manager walks in first and starts to introduce henry when henry walks in right behind him and we lock eyesyou all of a sudden see this poor man soul get crushed henry excuses himself and runs off to go to the bathroom the manager is quite confused and i simply say nice find but i bet you he aint coming back ive not seen henry since o and henry made my sales staff very happy not sure if you guys know how the business works however my sales staff is paid on the profit of a vehicle they get a bump at and another bump at well we got his entire stock of vehicles for a rock bottom price so lets say normally we pay say for this truck and sell it for with a pack sales person makes however if we got that truck for sales person now makes or as much as so those vehicles went through our dealer network very fast we had quite a few sales person have zip code pay days because of henry 
i posted this over on a darkest secret thread and someone thought you guys would like it here not all that dark but ive never told anyone my revenge story when i was years old my mom sent me to a summer camp in another county i knew other people there and we were placed in the same cabin the other cabin was full of the locals who had been there previous years i was a fat awkward kid and i got picked on all the time this camp was no exception but there was this one kid who was relentless well call him sam sam was always pushing me around calling me names constantly i wouldnt even eat if he was still in the lunch area one day we were in our cabin talking about how mean the other guys were and i decided to seek revenge i had to take a massive shit so i grabbed this plastic grocery bag and filled it up i took the bag to the other cabin while the other kids were out being cool i found sams bunk grabbed a pair of his underwear and shoved them down in the bag after squishing it up again i put it under sams mattress with a little bit of it hanging out by the way the stench was horrendous relieved i hadnt been caught i ran out of there and back to our cabin when the bullies came back in from playing we could hear their disgust it didnt take long for sam to be the new target of endless bullying nobody wanted anything to do with the kid that shit himself guess who didnt get picked on for the rest of camp
so due to a comment i made in a rrelationships post im here to elaborate background i f was at the time i moved from the east coast to the middle of nowhere i had made what i thought was a great friend in a younger girl f on campus she reminded me of myself and on top of it she was incredibly intelligent and a joy to be around she was unsure had low selfesteem was an introvert due to a really fucked up childhood i really did everything i could to include her in everything down to holidays with my family and worked on building trust she deserved it we got along so well and she started to come out of her shell and really blossomed we moved in together around this time i was admittedly dumb young naive and got into a relationship with a m twice divorced because he seemed like the most interesting and tolerable human in the area other than my roomie it should be noted that his first wife was a close friend of his hs girlfriend his second wife was a close friend of his first wife obvious pattern not saying i was smart the two of them over the course of a year hung out maybe times at bars they very rarely even talked to each other in fact he was an asshole and had little to no interest or so id thought in meeting any of my friends she was gone for the summer for an academic pursuit and when she came back i decided to cook a dinner for her and my so as i wanted them to be friends i wanted to be able to hang out with the both of them we picked his place because it had the bigger kitchen side note roomie had her first kiss as a drunken dare on her academic trip she had never been hit on let alone anything else in the midst of cooking i realized i needed a couple things to finish dinner put them in charge of keeping stuff from burning while i darted out for minutes came back found so and roomie banging needless to say i was devastated and maybe went a little nuts and vodka became my bff i lost a lot of weight i kicked roomie out of the apartment and threw all her shit on the lawn that night she moved in with him my friends back home tried to make me feel better by checking out the hysterical personal ads and casual encounters on craigslist bad idea i found several ads he had posted he had a very unique and pretentious writing style and they stretched back at least months rather than wallowing further in despair my friends back home drew up the game plan using pics provided by a friend of mine we created a google number and all had access to text from so i took the chance and replied to one of the postings he was obviously oblivious he also hated talking on the phone so i guess thats called catfishing and we talked for three weeks he travels for work and set up a date for the date i picked a local bar in town with a front and back patio told all my friends to tell their friends and packed nearly the entire place with team tananaramarex the folks who we didnt know were soon in on the act the friends he would recognize were on the back porch with me i had a friend of mine serve under a cover story as bouncerbody guardfirst contact when we got the text he was there i walked out with the friends that were hanging out back with me and i confronted him told him he was a piece of shit he was and how he should never do what he did to me and his exwives ever again and took a bow to a standing ovation i texted my former roomie as he left told her what i did and apologized for the condition he would be coming home in i felt as if she was manipulated and told her i never had any hard feelings against her really and that i understood if she was going to hate me after that i never spoke to either of them again and despite the small size of the town i never saw him again after that i moved away back to civilization a year and a half ago i dont regret what i did i still feel bad about my former roomie that piece of shit though i hope he never dates another woman tldr my so banged my virgin roomie i kicked her out catfished him from a craigslist casual encounter ad and humiliated him in a packed bar not sorry evidence literally pried out of my old ass external other edit i am more ashamed of dating this verbose cockmuncher now than i was then what an awful piece of shit
just replied in a petty revenge thread about cheating amp thought my cheating story belonged here my moms first year teaching included this class of seniors they were a bunch punks who made her cry with some not so nice pranks like putting deer urine in her air conditioner and crazy gluing the lock in her classroom door these are two of the big things i remember that really upset her my revenge consisted of selling them a fake answer key which made them fail their test they of course were upset so they started blocking their cell phone numbers before calling me during lunch amp leaving death threat voicemails unfortunately for them my dad is an agent with the fbi in our small home town after letting him know what was happening with the voicemails he got pretty concerned he doesnt play around with that kind of stuff so he immediately got a warrant court order that day from a judge issued to the cell phone carriers involved to obtain the account information after contacting the account holders parents and figuring out what was going on he had them meet him at the school while the officer assigned to our campus pulled those seniors out of class in cuffs he was initially pretty concerned which is what prompted him to get the warrant court order issued but he didnt want to screw over these kids by pressing charges instead he just put the fear of god into them amp explained how serious the situation could have been nobody messed with my mom or i after that my moms teaching included this class of seniors they were a bunch punks who made her cry putting deer urine in her air conditioner and crazy gluing the lock in her classroom door were the two big things i can remember my revenge consisted of selling them a fake answer key which made them fail their test they of course were upset so they started blocking their number and calling me during lunch to leave death threat voicemails unfortunately for them my fbi agent dad doesnt play around with that kinda stuff amp got a warrant that day from a judge to then get their info from their carriers before school was over he had the schools police officer pull them out of class in cuffs my dad pretty much just put the fear of god into them without having to say much at all nobody messed with my mom or i after that edit formatting edit i feel like i should add once he found out the people calling were the dumb kids involved before the warrant got the carriers to release who was involved he was pretty concerned after that he was just pissed off edit i suck at telling stories so i tried harder edit it was a court order not a warrant basis was domestic terrorism
i used to work for a company that was terrible about promising the moon and then dropping the responsibility for delivering it squarely on me they promised customers hardware features that nobody in the industry offered then theyd dump it in my lap and say make it happen then the salesman who sold it would scream bloody murder over things taking twice as long to install than they budgeted for when you sell people things that dont exist yet dont be surprised when it takes a tad longer than the handy spreadsheet corporate sent you says it will take it really ate into their commission so some of them wised up and would consult me before bidding a job with anything weird one guy just never got the message he did it over and over again without so much as a thank you for bailing him out i did my job and i took pride in it but one day he had the temerity to complain to our parent company about my open disdain for their lack of quality it was no surprise to them as i was always ranting to their quality control people over stupid crap that they shipped out im talking about receiving stuff with half the components falling off the board because that half of the board hadnt been soldered properly other things would come in with parts missing or the motor running backward etc of course all of them had quality control stickers on them claiming that they had passed some inspection or other so far as i could tell the only way some of them would have passed even a visual inspection would have been if they were using satellite imagery on most jobs out of devices failed on initial power up of the remaining more than half would fail in the first year of operation im a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to my work and this always upset and embarrassed me the conversation started over him trying to blame me for the number of warranty claims he insisted that i must not be grounding things properly nevermind every branch of the company was having the same trouble i do admit to going on a bit of a tirade but i was beyond fed up at this point and didnt really care whether i got fired or not i take pride in my work turd polishing is not something i signed up for nor do i tolerate it quietly especially when the company hasnt given anyone a decent raise in almost five years mr letsblametheguy whosavesmybacon had just sold another real science project that involved field modifying our equipment to add a feature that it was never intended to have meanwhile different companies had equipment that had to be cajoled into playing nice with our stuff and each other of course on jobs like that the final connections and making everything work together always gets overlooked when contracts are drawn up you always end up with everyone arguing that they arent responsible and trying to push it off onto everyone else it quickly escalates up the chain of command well this time was no different when i called to get him involved he texted me back saying he didnt have time to deal with it he was heading out for a week vacation starting that friday and had more important things to do in the end all i could get out of him was i dont care how you do it just make it happen normally id have pushed the issue but for once i didnt i meekly did what i was told and made it happen i never once slacked off but let me tell you after a month of hour work weeks those jobs had some of the best documentation and the prettiest wiring harnesses ive ever made nobody had to argue about a thing every time another company pawned their scope of work off on me i made it happen and documented my time meticulously i even took the progress photos he was supposed to submit and submitted them he never saw a dime of that commission hours of overtime that you failed to budget for will kinda do that edit forgot to include the tldr tldr salesman drops a hugejob for equipment that doesnt exist in my lap right before going on a week vacation his only instructions were make it happen well i made it happen by working so much overtime that my labor ate up his entire months commission so i got to claim hours of overtime and he didnt get paid that month 
i used to keep a bottle or sriracha in the fridge at my last job i even went as far as to write on the bottle that anyone could use it just please return it about a week in my bottle of sriracha goes missing the next bottle i put in the fridge i wrote do not touch on as someone had already abused the privilege of having public domain hot sauce a week or two later this bottle too goes missing at this point im heated from my lack of delicious sriracha so i go out and buy two bottles instead of one the first i put in my cubby so only i could use it the second i dumped the top inch of sriracha out of and replaced it with million scoville hot sauce i dont know who stole the third bottle but i know that they were probably shitting blood as just the residue left on my hands after washing them times was enough to make me gasp for air when i accidentally touched my finger to my mouth poor bastard 
a couple years ago i was in graduate school living with my gf and our yr old we lived in a cheaper area of town due to my fantastic grad student salaryit was not a dangerous areajust kinda cramped we lived in a townhouse apartment complex and had other neighbors with a shared walkwayentrance area for the first few weeks everything was great relatively quiet and had lots of room for low rent month for a until one of our neighbors started seeing a douchebag we noticed that someone would regularly show up at about am with their bass cranked way up and would just chill in the parking lot while his bae got ready normally it doesnt bother me if it was for a short period but he would sit for like mins and sometimes he wouldnt even be in the car but leave his music blaring with his windows down so i decided to ask him to turn it down while in the parking lot as he has been waking our daughter and a cranky child is not fun to deal with all day long he usually did but only for that visit the next night it would be right back to the same volume like he had the memory of a goldfish fast forward a couple weeks of this and than i notice he starts parking right in front of the walkway during the day now to the average person it is clear this is not really a spot but rather a gap in the parking spaces with no parking block and with orange lines on either side to allow residents to go to and from the building without having to squeeze between cars it is also smaller than the other spots but can still barely fit a vehicle now keep in mind this is a pretty small parking lot with many extra spacesso its not like you save that much time or effort parking there compared to even the furthest spot anyway he starts parking there of the time and just starts irritating my wife and i due to the fact that it can be a tight squeeze with a car seat or with our dogs not to mention that this is not an spot to begin with my solution is to park in the adjacent spot over the line so there is not enough room for his fatassed monte carlo to fit his response he parks behind my car in the middle of the parking lot thinking he can block me in well he does and the next morning i have an important am meeting and lo and behold i am blocked thankfully i own a really cheap saturn to get me to and from class i got it for about so its also mostly plastic in my early morning rage i decide to just nudgescrapehit his car with my car because i know he really cares about his vehicle as he is constantly cleaning and waxing it yet he parks in the middle of the parking lot a fantastic crunching sound ensues as i slowly push into his bumper than i readjust and pull out beside his vehicle while scraping all the way down the side of it than i leave to work when i get to work i notice a dent on my bumper that i smack to pop out and cleaned up some paint transfer my plastic panels did not sustain enough damage to actually break as they just bent during contact and popped out when i get back home the guy is in fury and is threatening to stab me and such but i claim it wasnt me and i was able to squeeze out of the spotso the police were called and they look at the cars and see no fresh damage on my car and say it wasnt me the officer also tells the guy well what the hell did you expect when you parked in the middle of the parking lot i also discover i was not the only one to hit his vehicle as there was another mark down the side which to my delight ended up being due to one of his girls friends since she admitted to maybe bumping his car while backing out after this incident i demanded to be let out of our lease with no penalty amp with our security deposit thankfully the office obliged and we moved to another part of town added bonus after said douche fixed his bumper and door panel someone spray painted his white car with black spray paint not me i swear edit decided to add a picture i had this was taken the weekend before the incident the parking lines on the left are all empty spots you can kinda see my saturn in front of his vehicle 
i had originally posted this in petty revenge but ubrilliantlyinsane suggested i should post it here enjoy when i was a little girl we didnt live on an actual street we lived on a culdesac my neighbors had put up a basketball hoop at the end and it was the coolest thing because kids from all over would come and wed play together i could get along with every one of them except for these two boys from day one they called me every name in the book made fun of me called me fat threw rocks at me you name it i remember coming home to my parents and just crying because i didnt know how to handle it they explained that they couldnt go out there every time i had a disagreement with someone so i should just say something back next day there they come theres actually a lot of kids outside and im playing with my friends and they decide to come up and start namecalling but i turned around and called them the mf word right there in front of god and everybody you know what they did they told my parents i was grounded for the longest time so apparently they cant handle me talking back but i knew that i got on their nerves easily once i was allowed to go back outside thats all i did was bother them i refused to play with my friends because i needed to annoy them i was that kid i would just say stuff like youre stupid i hate you your mom hates you you suck etc on this particular day i was riding my bike they decide to leave for some reason i cant remember and i call out to them yeah you better leave or ill run you over with my bike you cant run me over with your bike excuse me are you are you trying me do you have any idea how long ive waited for something like this to happen seriously yeah i can run you over with my bike okay ill just stand right here well if youre just going to stand there i am not going to pass up this opportunity are you kidding me so there i go i turn my bike around the end of the court and pedal as fast as i can towards him and boom run him over i was so proud of myself and kind of shocked that i did it i hear from under me get off me cough cough i cant breathe so i backpedal over him instead of getting off the bike and he is dry heaving so hard i almost felt bad he manages to spit out a few words in between his coughs why would you do that get off my street motherfucker from that day on i was never bullied again edit fixed minor grammar mistakesrewrote sentences to make more sense edit whenever im having a conversation with someone about being bullied ill listen to whatever they have to say no matter how longwinded they are its a hard subject to talk about and if youre willing to share with me your experiences i will hear you out a lot of people dont realize this but its actually healthy to get upset or angry sometimes however what you do with that anger is a different story and to deny yourself those feelings and to hold onto them will only turn into hatred and whether you like it or not hatred is passion instead of being passionate about things you love and people you care about your passion is wasted towards brewing hatred i realize that not all problems can be solved by fighting back but i am an incredibly stubborn and severely blunt person and i will not sit there idly and let someone aggravate me until all of my thoughts are polluted by whatever things they have done to me i say all that to say this i admit that this story is greatly exaggerated but i dont tell this story because i want bragging rights or because violence is the answer i tell this story to inspire others to do something about their issues instead of not doing anything at all and letting all that anger bottle up inside of you the very reason this subreddit was created however there is some truth to this story i did get bullied i did get in trouble for cursing i did have mal intent with my bike and i did scare everyone on my block so all of you motherfuckers in the comment section causing a huge commotion over something that never happened to them need to calm the fuck down immediately and should probably do something productive at work for once instead of waste our dwindling natural resources used to create the electricity you are carelessly exploiting on trivial internet bickering drops mic
ex employer left me with k of shares that can never be redeemed not within my power so i reported them to the cra for sred fraud fines are on top of what they got so k means k you need to pay the government back i also reported them for running income out of the country and the operations they run out of a rd world nation i told them also about possible tax evasion scheme they also seem to have been running if found guilty the fine is likely to bankrupt the company while the audit is going im still continuing to pursue my money and building a case against them then when i win a judgement and they dont have cash im going to go in to their offices and take their laptops and servers im going to copy and format them and then sell them the ceo somehow has been immune to this shortage of funds situation and im sure that there is massive fraud on their end when it gets exposed i will do everything in my power so that fucker ends up in prison the money doesnt even matter to me i could spend another k if it ensured the destruction of his company and personal life for the record this company that doesnt pay me had me make their main platform which they brag about front and center on their home page i was lead developer and brought it to market under insane timelines with a inexperienced team instead of thanking me they scammed me dismissed me the day the project was done without cause and didnt even give me a reference for my work that theyve significantly profited off over the last years i have sympathy for them anymore the fraud needs to be exposed and i dont care about my money just their shame ceo getting assraped in jail though would definitely be a bonus its not just me his fucked a lot of people in the past a lot worse than me they just dont like fighting
i have been working at ralphs grocery store for months now and this story starts month into my employment it was raining outside and i was braving the elements to bring in carts for customers and a lady i will call her mrs wonderful decides it is my fault that none of the available carts are dry directing her very loud and aggressive voice past the stand with paper towels to dry the carts right at me i begin fuming inside at this entitled bitch who is too good for the elements but i smile and wipe down her cart for her i tell her that if customers brought their carts up to the front after unloading their groceries none of them would be wet but she disregarded my statements and later left her cart in the middle of one of the handicapped spots for it to get rained on the gears have begun to turn in my head months go by with her coming in about twice a week to buy dollars worth of expensive wine and vegan groceries for her very wealthy husband i assume based on her massive ring and porsche carrera gt and then i became a cashier and i saw my opportunity whenever i worked i would watch for her and when she got in line i would hop on a register and call her over to my line to checkout everything was ready for my revenge at our first encounter behind the register i slipped her salt off the belt to the side because the only reason people buy salt is because they are out and basically everything needs salt i dont ring it up its not on the receipt its not in her bags and its not hers perfect she comes in the next day only for salt and with a very unhappy look on her face i smirk i do this a couple more times not every time because this is a long play and i cannot get caught but about every third time but i think she is about to put and together so i move to phase two of the plan i start to take items off her belt at other cashiers register she comes in screaming at my manager because her items keep going missing on the day before i had taken the cumin from her belt on another cashiers register mrs fantastic speed walks in arms aswinging and walks up to the year old gentlemen who had rung her up the day before and yells where is my fucking cumin and he started laughing made this all worth it and made me want to continue this to the next level mrs compassionate then storms over to my manager who says she will look into it but never does because she thinks mrs forgiving is just looking for free groceries then mrs giving begins to stare intently at the belt when she is checking out fuck what am i going to do now so whenever i am sweeping the floors and i see her i steal an item from mrs sharings basket even watching the belt she sees nothing happening yet her butter an egg yes only a single egg from the carton some spices the occasional meat and when im feeling really ballsy a bottle of wine gets put swiftly back on the shelf i can visibly see her breaking down week after week looking in her cart to make sure everything is there every minute watching the belt being aggressive and hateful to the cashiers i step it up another notch i start to not steal her groceries but swap them with the competitors brands i have no idea if she notices but it makes me feel good inside to think that she is confused when she gets home one particular night i replaced her dollar bottle of wine with a dollar bottle which i had stored under the register one that looks eerily similar to the one she bought and i think i saw her start to tear up when i rang the correct one up for the next day at least i hope thats what i saw month ago i decided to lay off this woman because i think i broke her enough to say ive gotten my revenge that didnt stop her from still checking over her shoulder watching the belt staring at the screen that tallies up the order every time she is in the store but she still leaves her cart in the lot and doesnt put it away so i am still taking items out of her cart every once in a while just to keep her on edge anxious and fearful and will continue to haunt her shopping experience forever so mrs delightfull thank you for shopping at ralphs where you get real low prices and a fast checkout tldr i ruined a bitchy womans life by messing with her at ralphs

preemptive edit this was originally written by me under a different reddit account on rpettyrevenge a poster there suggested i should post here so i did on my new account im russianamerican and every summer i spend time in a summer camp over there great place lots of fun memories for one thinking about working there next year this story takes place several summers ago the previous school year was hellish for me had a few things gone differently i might not be here today so i was happy id get two months in russia before switching high schools the first of three sessions at camp went well i got a leadership award celebrated my birthday watched russia choke in the euro that session ended and within two days the next one started with new kids the leadership award i got on the previous session somewhat enticed me to be more active in the camp so first day in the afternoon im walking around meeting new people walk into a male room of the city younger than us call them city we lived in a building of with kids broken up into six cities of each led by a lordlady the equivalent of a counselor anyway i walk into this room say hi start chatting a couple of the kids are making small talk a third is lying on his bed facing away from me playing on his phone i try to get something going with him silence another attempt the guy flips me the bird and says fuck off will you his english nickname at the camp turned out to be blaine i tried to get along with him and the other boys in his city and things got better or maybe just less blatant the boys in my city started flirting with the girls both in our city and in city blaines city the first few days were fine but slowly blaine and his roommates starting acting annoyed that our city was encroaching on their females it didnt matter that they sat on their asses all day playing on their phones they wanted the girls from their city to be talking to them only i tried to stay off to the side of this mainly because i had shitall luck flirting with people and because i felt that this would only get worse but i still for some reason decided to play wingman for the other kids in my room this got to the point where i faked lightheadedness at night so that the counselor watching our hallway would be distracted enough to let messer my roommate slip down the hall afterhours after that particular episode messer decided i shouldnt keep playing wingman and decided that hed help me find a girl one week left no fucking problem messer went about trying to find me a second half me tagging along for shits and giggles he very quickly settled on esme a relatively tall blonde girl from city i took it upon myself to get acquainted with her because well she was pretty attractive for a year old in most other situations this would wind up being a borderline rneckbeardstories submission with enough of my cringe to go around but that didnt happen here the afternoon after highly suggesting who i should try and hook up with our building went to the pool i chatted a bit with esme and it went reasonably well by any standards i thought something had started all the while the relationship between the two oldest cities was crumbling to dust someone from city tried to spook a girl of ours during an archery event by firing into her lane while she was picking arrows up as multiple people nearby had fired simultaneously no one knew who was guilty purposefully too high to hit anything but close enough to spook tim my roommate built like a lineman retaliated by fucking with citys compot drinks putting salt in some pepper in others olive oil in a third things were getting relatively heated anyway before i had a chance to tank any gains i made the next day blaine did that for me you see esme was his girl and id be damned if i didnt know that more so i was from city so now by flirting with his girl i had signed myself on to the conflict blaine or one of his cronies started by writing a gossip note in our buildings gossip box a place where one could drop anonymous notes that if deemed appropriate were read at the daily announcements the note put in there contained a whole lot of shit calling various people sluts telling our head lord he was a drunk idiot and naming citys lady a shiteating hippy fucktard the note was signed hunter now anyone with a brain if they saw this note would understand hunter has enough sense not to write something like that and sign his name as im sitting in my room in walks the lady from city i had actually known her from the previous year of camp and was on quite friendly terms with her our lady follows city s lady looks pissed and she shows me the unfurled note and asks me why i thought this way why the hell am i coming here if im so pessimistic etc etc our lady followed up by saying this was good for two warnings and a removal of the leadership award i got the previous session i was stunned by all of this and told them that in no way i thought any of that why the hell would i sign my name that this was some horrible setup i managed to argue it down to one warning but was shaken blaine had immediately gone for the jugular a few hours later we started our second thematic game of the day at the camp each day had a theme like indians police business this day was military and the second game was one where two enemy armies with different colored paper strips taped to their shoulder fought each other around the territory of the camp trying to tear off each others lives strips of paper taped to the shoulder i was placed into one army blaine and esme into another the game started and we were maneuvered around by the lord in charge we encountered the enemy and engaged them i was running with a couple of other older boys finding high value targets and eliminating them one of my comrades was george a guy from our city the other was imber a beatboxing douche who lived with blaine wasnt there on the first day imber peeled off to take care of some annoying cityers while george and i tried to run a pincer around messer as im shuffling closer towards messer who was busy shuffling away from george i was keeping my eye out for anybody trying to snipe me from behind even with george watching my other side as he closed in this left a degree blindspot in vision around my right shoulder something charged into this blindspot at full fucking force knocking me to the ground i try to roll over to see if it was someone who sniped me from behind nope no one retreating into that direction whoever hit me must have continued running at that moment messer no longer cornered but still pursued by george ran up and quickly tore my strip off and then ran off to shake off george i started to push myself up to a sitting position but before i got anywhere someone stepped on me or more exactly ran onto over and through me that stunned me for a second and i lay there trying to regain my breath for some reason i rolled over and saw blaine running off about feet from me the direction he was going in the lack of anyone else in that immediate area that fucker had just purposefully run over me finally our general ordered a retreat i dont know why he did not pause the game when i was knocked down like he was supposed to i walked back to our group and george told me that imber purportedly on our side was the guy who knocked me down i accosted him with this and he claimed that he had seen blaine and went off to kill him accidentally bumping me malicious intent obviously could not be proven well fuck that i didnt need a goddamn jury blaine was going to pay for what he and imber just did i made him my only target for the remaining three battles first battle nothing on the second one i came close to tearing it off but was ultimately killed myself by an unrelated player third battle last life final opportunity to show this fucker that yes you can push me down but i will still find you and still kill you i ran around that field chasing my only target nothing could stand in my way every city or city kid who charged up to me was killed i finally ended up feet behind blaine as he was knocking it out with someone else i saw my opportunity and charged blaine didnt turn around until the final two steps which put his right shoulder directly in my path i could have bodychecked him ripping his strip off and spiking it into the grass but unlike blaine i didnt want to break any rules so i shout my palm forward ripped the strip off and juked slightly to the left to avoid hitting him i had killed him blaines puny ingame life was now sitting crumpled in my hands i was now the jaime lannister of the battlefield blaineslayer i darted around looking for my next target and spotted n one of our girls both city and army under attack someone else was ripping at n literally practically scratching with finger nails and trying to slow down n by latching on to her ponytail i recognized that blonde blur esme i didnt hold a grudge against her like i did against blaine but that was brutal play right there and itd be much less brutal if esme was dead as well i closed in stop stop someone was blaring a whistle i felt someone bear hug me as well turning my charge into more of a standing crawl and then suddenly i was losing ground being pulled back the game had stopped even the nesme catfight had died down people were staring atoh my they were staring at me staring at me getting dragged out of the game by a counselor yelling at me for brutal play this counselor had spent two years out of high school in the russian paratroops so i decided to shut up and not resist i was dragged over to our cities lady hunter your play out there was very brutal and dangerous because we had to drag you out of the game were giving you a second warning the only reason youre not losing your leader title is because you got these warnings separately at first i honestly believed her maybe in my wrath i did manage to knock a kid down i played a lot fairer than other kids but oh well shit happens who do i apologwait a fucking second off in the distance i saw blaine and imber leaning against the building both were dead not in the game and thus had the freedom to talk suddenly blaine tapped imber on the shoulder pointed where i was sitting and the two started laughing those bastards he had complained and gotten me pulled from the game and a warning given to me on top of that whatever doubt i had left evaporated when my lady said the other party in the situation was fine if i had knocked down a year old they most certainly wouldnt be fine the medic would be looking them over and id be told to apologize but there was no one to apologize to because this was all a fucking setup so there i sat for the rest of the game trying to think of what id do next i had already tried to take revenge on blaine but he had upped the ante i had to do something total something to which there could be no response and then it hit me blaine was watching the warnings rise on me one more warning and id be stripped of my award sent home and banned from the camp for a whole calendar year given that i still had a session to go that would mean or so flushed down the toilet why not give blaine some warnings but the score was too lopsided for minor retaliation at if i goaded blaine into his first warning hed respond with forcing my third and final warning a situation impossible to recover from of course i could isolate myself enough to lower the chances of those warnings but thatd make these last five days not fun at all i needed to get him all at once from experience rummaging around in his room the day before trying to find proof of the notes he had wrote i noticed blaine had brought an ecigarette with him to camp i normally dont give a fuck even if youre whatever floats your boat but this time that was solid solid evidence against him it anything would get him out immediately it was the cig but i couldnt just bring it to the attention of the lords that would be too easy too identifiable and for all i knew id get my third warning for snooping around peoples rooms i had to accidentally find it in the presence of a lordlady and then draw their attention to it without simply saying blaine why do you have an ecig in your room i started to think about how to purposefully discover something in front of other people and yet still look innocent i woke up the next day and a plan immediately came into my mind the schedule in the hallway which i had read while brewing tea in the morning told us today was supposed to be adventures day whose main event was an inbuilding activity where two cities under the direction of the older citys lordlady led city and city etc moved around trying to solve puzzles in various rooms that meant id be sitting in the same room as blaine several times today under jurisdiction of our citys lady after lunch i walked up to the head lord and asked him what rooms would be in use and if i needed to clean my room i was told no the only rooms in use would be the following four one of those rooms was blaines everything had fallen in place during quiet hour while the main hall was empty i got into the possessions of our citys lady inside was a bag of lindor truffles she obsessed over i took those truffles and hid them under my bed until blaines room left for english lessons i bolted in there and placed the bag of truffles inside a moreorless empty drawer that i knew contained a couple bottles of soda i then rummaged around for the ecig and placed it in there as well perfect the day continued along we went to have dinner after the first event and then were split into our three groups of two cities for the second event just like i had remembered from past sessions we were paired with city in we went finally into the tomb our redecorated building and we went from room to room solving mysteries we approached blaines room rd went in and sat down our lady started her script about what we needed to do in the room it was undoing a curse of some sorts by toggling various mundane objects in the correct order at a stopping point i interrupted and asked blaine if i could have a drink since i was sitting on his bed next to his drawers with soda fine he said you can be total year old asses to one another in russia but you had a social obligation to share food to his credit all he expected to see was a couple of bottles of soda i started to open the drawer and before our lady could interrupt me about disturbing the game i opened it and pulled out the lindor while im at it could i have some i held the bag and asked blaine he looked at it strangely our lady looked at him strangely cut off mid sentence by finding her bag for she had noticed it missing right after dinner right in blaines drawers what is this she asked point at the bag blaine was stammering something out as our lady got up and walked towards the drawers this is when the killer blow struck she walked over to me and grabbed the bag prepared to spout off a lecture about stealing items then she noticed the ecig that woman might have valued her lindor but upon spotting the ecig the lindor fell to the floor up went the cigarette blaine was pale as a sheet as our lady turned around and stood there blankfaced with the cigarette after seconds she said go downstairs inform the head lord of thisincidentand then pack your bags blaine left the room and we continued playing the intercity game suddenly the hostility we had experienced in previous games had subsided blaine spent his last hours at the camp standing at the security post waiting for his mothers car to arrive from moscow ish miles to the northeast i had managed to make it and god did i revel in that golden goal but there was still one last thing to do if you remember i never got around to killing esme in the military game her catfight had gone unpunished i let it slide until the final day awards for the campers were being discussed between the lords and ladies there were two tiers permanent awards like the one i got the previous session that came with a title discount website mention and singlesession awards that did not role over from year to year i was asked to check nickname spelling for each kid that won an award esme somehow qualified for a singlesession award and i smiled as i saw her name no no this ones wrong it should be spelled assme trust me on this one sure enough esme was called up to the stage and received her certificate declaring assme an example of being an active camper and corresponding name badge i chuckled as she looked at the name and slowly put it in her pocket was that a bit too much potentially but two years later when i ran into her again she had gotten a higher title with the correct spelling on it no for those of you asking nothing ever happened between me and her i was already thoroughly put off by the whole blaine experience and by the time i added her on the russian equivalent of facebook and noticed her flurry of white supremacist posts all drive was lost tldr roommate at summer camp inadvertently drags me into conflict between two groups of males by introducing me to a blond acquaintance of the other group i am targeted by that group for halfheartedly trying to flirt with her because she is theirs despite them not really going after her am slandered injured and come pretty close to being banned from summer camp i loved instead i manage to get their leader kicked out by setting him up for theft and tobacco possession 
alright this was told to me by a friend he is the pilot of the story this happened on a towboat a towboat holds about people the captain is the highest and his word is pretty much law on a vessel then the relief captain then pilot then engineertankerman then deckhand the captain who we will call cap was a colossal dick he constantly tormented the deck crew he lost over deckhands in one year deckhands would literally just leave the boat whenever the boat would dock for fuel or for barge transfers the captain was giving a stern talking to but considering that captains are like gold it would take an extreme amount to get them fired enter riou riou was an innocent faced year old kid he was very eager to learn and tried to take the initiative to do as much as he could he had a great attitude and my friend could easily seem him advancing soon cap on the other hand had a permanent stick shoved up his ass and hated riou he would constantly make homophobic slurs against riou frequently implying that he wouldnt even let riou perform certain sexual favors no matter how much riou begged riou at first took it well he just figured it was new guy hazing but even the other more experienced deck hands thought this was extreme not because of what was being said but because of the malice behind it cap also gave riou extremely ridiculous jobs like telling him to go out with a toothbrush and scrub the barge its around a degrees in august and he is having this kid on his hands and knees on a heater barge that has heaters that heat the sludgeoil so it doesnt solify inside the barge so the barge is easily degrees my friend did what he could to help the guy because he didnt want him to quit he was telling him that he only had to make it more weeks then he could request a transfer to another boat and he would make sure he got it riou had other plans so to make sure you guys understand what happened watches are hours long captain was on front watch so he worked to both times the pilot worked back watch which was to the wheelhouse is the usually the highest point of the boat this boat had decks wheel house on the top then the pilots rooms on the third deck then the second deck which housed the crew then the bottom deck which was the galley engine room generator room and rudder room stairs separate each of the decks so cap just relieved my pilot friend and he was heading downstairs to his room to get some stuff then go eat breakfast riou was heading up to the wheelhouse as the captain usually calls him up there first thing in the morning to give him his shit list as my friend was coming out of his room he heard riou screaming along the lines of no get your hands off me stop oww why are you doing this then the pilot hears a large thud he ran to the stair case and saw riou laying at the bottom in a crumpled heap and cap up at the top screaming stuff at riou my friend thought the captain finally snapped and tried to kill a deckhand he did insinuate that he would do it often enough so the office is contacted they had to get riou off the boat and to the hospital i believe he ended up having a couple broken ribs a broken wrist and i believe a concussion the local authorities are called and cap is arrested after they took everyones story riou claimed that cap pushed him down the stairs cap lost his job his license i think he was put on parole my friend said he never talked to him again and only heard about what happened through other towboaters riou on the other hand healed nicely and even continued towboating fast forward years and riou is now an experienced engineer when my friend is riding over to make some extra cash and is put on the same boat as riou before my friend got off the boat riou confessed to him that riou did it to himself because he couldnt take it anymore my friend had a lot of self conflicting issues with this story as to whether or not to tell the office the truth but so far he still hasnt its been about years since this has happened tldr captain gets arrested for karma
i had originally posted this in rpettyrevenge but it was suggested that i cross post it here too does it count as petty revenge if the target didnt specifically do anything to me personally a few years ago i went back to school to get another ba because the first time around my gpa could be charitably called aggressively mediocre and i really wanted to go to grad school my wife had a full time job at the time so i didnt need to get a part time job or anything but i get bored easily i applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and wasnt particularly demanding work it was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the lobbies of various dorms on weekends and checking ids of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest it was part of the campus safety initiative most of the time i just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last callthis is in canada so its pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age occasionally i was asked to patrol around campus and ticket cars that were improperly parked i didnt mind the walking but ticketing students never sat well with mewho has money for that shitso this was not my favorite part of the job as an aside i tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard fuck the man anyway one day in the late fallstill above freezing but not by muchi was outside the engineering building and i saw a newish bmw seriesor maybe it was an m i dont recall so im just going to say it was an m for brevityparked in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags as usual i approach the car slowly like im sneaking up on it i discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive ive found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud blustery car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd its better to sneak up on the car confirm that it is in fact illegally parked or has an expired pass walk away write the ticket and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper gtbe me meter nazi gtuse stealthy ticket gtit is very effective i wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off i did another walk around the rear parking lot and then because it was near the end of my shift i returned to that same building because there was a tims inside and i wanted to grab lunch and a coffee i go inside get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke im standing by the smoking dont actually know what these things are calleddrink in one hand sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket smoke in the other hand and just zone out next thing i know theres some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly i zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the m hes this skinny dude wearing a puffy and hes got fancy hair i figure hes probably or tops hes got the yellow envelope in one hand and hes all fucking shit fuck fuck dick cunt shit fuck motherfucker etc while hes swearing and having a bit of a spaz hes also looking around presumably to see if the meter nazi is still around so he can give him a piece of his mind oh wait im the meter nazi and im like feet away still smoking sandwich in my pocket coffee in the other hand parking ticket printer slung across my chest well shit gtbe me gtbe at the end of your shift gtexpect to be yelled at by puffy vest fancy hair i steel myself for the eventual tirade policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations our interactions should consist of yes sirmaam no sirmaam i understand sirmaam but overall being firm about why they received a ticket he swings his vision around several times but doesnt seem to spot me im not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory blue campus security jacket and a ticket printer he keeps looking around left right left right i take another drag for whatever reason he doesnt see me he angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car bleeps the car with his remote and heads back into the building so im still standing by the smoking sandwich in my pocket halffull medium doubledoublethe old medium not the new upsized mediumwith one drag left on my smoke so i finish my smoke feed the pawn and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich im sitting on the bench eating my sandwich drinking my coffee and staring at this m that is still parked in the handicap space im gonna finish my sandwich drink my doubledouble have another smoke and then im going to give him another ticket says i to myself its a trap replies my brain making a very good point i dunno man this is too good of an opportunity to pass up im just saying how could it be a trap what he has a gang of puffy vested bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a dance do whatever you want just no concussions my brain made a valid point this would be an excellent trap i pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth wash it down with my now lukewarm doubledouble and light up another smokedu maurier light kings with the droopy cigarette impotence warning no doubtand stare at the entrance to the engineering building no sign of puffy vest fancy hair with one hand i start typing out the ticket on the printer but dont press the print button yetif i hit the button it saves the data and theres no way to undo it once that happens i wasnt yet ready to commit to this course of action i finish my second cigarette pull out a yellow envelope take a breath and hit print as i start walking toward the car the thermal printer quickly spits out the ticket and i quickly insert the ticket into the envelope and sling it under the wiper nothing happens no ambush no screaming no puffy vest fancy hair all that buildup for nothing i check my phoneif i recall correctly it was a motorola flip phone of some varietyand shift ended a few minutes ago im not technically in any hurry to get back to the office we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so im not preventing anyone from starting their shift by dillydallying i use the camera phonewith a whopping x resolutionto take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper then i walk into the engineering building get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area and i hope that this kid isnt in a three hour class im now here for a show im going to get yelled at itll be a huge scene ill have to be all professional about it but seeing puffy vest fancy hair have another spaz is totally worth it youre an idiot says my brain i let my coffee cool just for a bit before i take a swig of course i forgot to check where the paper cup seam was and dribbled coffee down my chin son of a bitch i put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee dribble from my chin just as i hear another stream of cunt fuck motherfucker what the fucking fuck erupts from the vicinity of the m who the fuck did this what the fuck theres puffy vest fancy hair sack of fast food in one hand jumbo fountain drink in the otherah to have the metabolism of a yearold againhes whirling around trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm hes now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by for some reason he still hasnt spotted me im standing a mere feet from where he is spazzing i am right beside the smoking pawn wearing a blue jacket that says campus security on it i have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest for some reason his gaze never lingers on me at all after a few more seconds of spazzing he gets in his car throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away why he didnt see me is inexplicable the only hypothesis i have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else maybe a high visibility or maybe something like i dunno i dont recall how much those tickets run a few hundred i think but that kid had one expensive day my boss did tell me that the kids father called in pretty pissed about the tickets i had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because i figured hed probably ask my why i wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day my boss explained to the kids father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle remove the ticket and leave it counted as a separate parking incident thus two tickets were warranted tldr guy in puffy vest gets a double shot of karma for parking in handicap zone

i was going to post this in petty revenge but my friend said it would do better here so here i go now note i did this because i read this somewhere else and thought i would try it ampnbsp backstory about three weeks ago a kid that goes to my school and me got into a fight the night before playing hockey so he apparently hadnt vented all his anger towards me and popped the front and back tire of my bike in two locations he was actually very smart to do this as i only have two patches in my patch kit now as ive said in other stories my school is about k away from my house my parents were out of town for a while and my brother cant legally drive so i was stuck with the option of ride my bike home and destroy my rims or walk so i walked and walked and walked as soon as i got home i went on to reddit to try to find other peoples revenge in similar situations and found one that suited me perfectly ampnbsp revenge at my school you can rent lockers by asking the secretary for a key to locker number xxx or something you can have these lockers for two weeks for free then you start to have to pay for them month my friends saw the fight happen and agreed to help me with revenge two weeks before the end of the school year we all of us started going in every two hours or so and checking out keys with a different secretary each time there were then wed wait three or so days and repeat we got keys in all three days before the end of the year on the final day we all had to go to an end of the year assembly however me and all my friends skipped grabbed his phone out from his desk and started our plan we locked his phone in a locker then the key to that locker in a locker along with a complicated math equation to tell him what locker number the key he had went to then locked that key in another locker we repeated this with all the keys until we had just the first key and a math equation we set those in his desk and wait i will update to see how he reacts hope you liked my revenge tldr guy makes me walk k home i make him do math edit he finally got his phone back and my friend told a friend who told guy in story whos now really mad at us i also as final revenge locked his locker key in a locker when he was busy and took the idea of a commenter thanks umynamesdick and wrote an equation that said how many steps northeast or something he had to walk to get the key to get his key back edit alot of people are asking this i picked up all the keys he used when he was working on the next locker and i gave them back to the office
when i was about years old i lived at the end of a deadend street my friends and i all loved sports amp since my road had no traffic it was the perfect setting for all our football amp street hockey games about houses up from mine on the opposite side of the street there lived an old man who was a complete asshole his favorite thing to do was to sit in his living room amp stare out his front window looking for shit to complain about he would seriously bitch about the most trivial shit trying to get us in trouble he would call my parents because we were going too fast on our bicycles because we had hung on the rim of our own personal basketball goalit was ridiculous one day he took the shit too far though for christmas i had gotten one of those neat nerf footballs with a tail that you could throw a mile it was just a couple days after i got it amp we were playing football in the street when one of my friends missed a catch amp the ball took an odd bounce landing right in ol dickheads front yard like a geriatric flash his old ass was out the door snatching the ball up amp carrying it back inside i ran up and knocked on the door and asked for it back because it was my football amp he basically told me to go fuck myself it was on his property amp its his football now little did this old man know that just recently my friends amp i had developed the technology to fill water balloons with any kind of liquid we wanted this fancy piece of engineering was a simple liter coke bottle the trick is to fill the bottle with liquid blow up the balloon with air pinch it closed amp then put he balloon on the neck of the bottle simply turn it upside down amp your balloon is now full of whatever i rallied the troops and we went to work on building up our weapons cache we all took turns pissing in the bottle until it was full put on some kitchen gloves amp started filling balloons in the end we had about or good ones as soon as the balloons were full we sprang into action we all unloaded our ordinance right on his front door watching as the balloons unleashed their steaming payload all over the entry way we all bolted for some nearby bushes to hide amp watch the show hearing the impacts ol dickhead comes flying out the door amp almost busts ass from slipping in the puddle of piss he let loose with one of the best fits of rage ive had the pleasure of hearing to this day never did get that football back but after hearing my side of the story my dad bought me a new one 
original thread so i honestly had no idea it got big or that people cared so i am super sorry that i didnt update sooner it didnt seem like anything happened right away so i was feeling a disappointing update would suck but it all worked out really nicely my manager updated me on the situation a bit so the day i came back it turned out they had taken her up to hr and told her they knew about the comments she demanded to see the print outs but they said no when she came back down she was pissed off and was for days after that whispering to people about how unfair it all was a few coworkers actually deactivated their facebooks for a few weeks in paranoia that something similar would happen to them then it really seemed like nothing happened and i was pretty bummed but then my coworker who hates her way more than i do gleefully told me otherwise so right after the event she took a vacation to texas this vacation was really sudden considering we require three weeks notice for vacation shes also talks constantly so we hear about all of her plans months ahead of time this one she didnt talk about at all i found out the reason for her sudden vacation was that she was suspended for a little over a week but used the excuse of a vacation to cover it up and visited some friends of the family she didnt tell a soul i guess she was really embarrassed but my coworker who hates her is very good friends with one of the higher up managers and found out she doesnt suspect me at all because im such a sweet person outwardly even to her shes actually been even nicer to me lately than ever and even ran up and glomped the hell out of me at work the other day out of nowhere so maybe she learned her lesson not too sure but its a happy ending in my books 
this is a twofold revenge part is revenge on my behalf by someone else the other part is not mine but it was perpetrated by one of my clients who told me what hed done almost ten years later ive been in real estate in chicago actually southside and southsouthwest suburbs for nearly years so im helping a guy sell his condo the place was absolutely gorgeous the guy was a general contractor bought it as a dump gutted it and turned it into a palace what makes this even more entertaining is that the guy was years old his wife died he sold his house bought the condo and figured hed die there nope he ended up meeting some spry little year old hottie and they were going to get married and live at her house lets call the seller mike a guy who we will call big fking ahole bfa comes to see the condo which is somewhat overpriced but it was severely over improved and i thought we could get that price i didnt notice bfas appointment time when i went to visit mike for a signature on a price reduction so i just happened to be there when bfa shows up bfa shows up and doesnt have an agent with him this is a nono but since im there i walk him through he mentions that he called his realtor because he saw my sign so this wasnt a property that his agent actually found for him oh well whatever he seems unimpressed and leaves mike drops the price to and wants minimum because he doesnt want to owe anything after closing bfas agent calls me and says bfa wants to make an offer but shes busy she wants me to meet with her client to write up an offer i point out the legal issues with this and shes like i wont say anything if you dont i call my broker not the same one in the previous story i wrote and explain the situation he asks his wife also a realtor to handle writing up the offer illinois allows dual agency where i can help a buyer and seller at the same time for the same property but i cant do it for a realtor with another brokerage after my brokers wife gets done bfa tells her hes having second thoughts and to hold off during the next two weeks bfa shows up at mikes condo seven times unannounced no appointment and has no realtor with him mike is a nice guy and thinks hes got a hot buyer so he lets the guy in to look around measure write notes take pictures etc i had no idea this was going on or i would have put a stop to it anyway bfa talks to mike whos ready to move bfa says he knows mike only bought it for three years earlier mike tells the guy that the lowest hes going is because he took out a construction loan and put about into the fullgut remodel with high end materials and appliances im not kidding the place was spectacular bedroom bath living room huge chefs kitchen wet bar jacuzzi tubs formal dining room vaulted ceilings family room loft and every room was wired for phone cable surround sound and internet which was a relatively new thing at the time mike also showed bfa the net sheet i gave him which showed that at mike would walk away with bfa calls his realtor who calls me to have me make the offer that my brokers wife wrote up however bfa calls my brokers wife and tells her to lower the offer from to because that old man can afford to bring a hundred bucks to closing the way the numbers work based on the net sheet and market time mike still would have walked away with a few bucks i get the offer from my brokers wife and she tells me to enjoy the little gift and im not taking anything away ill explain this later i present the offer to mike and mike tells me to just hold onto it because he has another appointment scheduled and wants to see if theyll make an offer they dont but mike waits anyway at this point bfa has inconvenienced him multiple times and gave a low im gonna screw this old man so he walks away with nothing offer after having a very frank discussion bfa is calling every day to ask about his offer i can tell that he loves it his agent nowhere to be found never got a call from her finally weeks later bfas calls have gone from innocent inquiry to angry screaming no theres no time limit on illinois real estate contracts unless you put one in and he didnt mike finally signs off because he feels bad for me he would have left bfa hanging another weeks if he didnt feel bad about me having to deal with the calls bfa does his inspection and tries to renegotiate mike tells him to drop dead since mike is a general contractor and knows the work is done to code despite what bfas inspector said by the way bfas inspector was a friend of his bfa still moves forward bfa drags his feet with his bank and the closing keeps getting pushed back mike is pissed at bfa finally we close instead of being in a room together mike and bfa are in separate rooms because they hate each other at this point and no one wants an explosion bfa tries to renegotiate at the closing mike literally yells he wants because i dont have low flow toilets ill give him but im going to jam it up his ass to my fucking elbow i dont know if bfa heard it but i would have loved to have seen the look on his face now the revenge had on my behalf the closer comes in near the end and says jane doe from xyz realty called to tell me to send her commission check to her office i dont see that shes getting a check i give her a copy of the contract and addenda and show her what my brokers wife added to it not only did she have him sign an exclusive buyer broker agreement naming her as his designated agent she also got him to write and sign in his own handwriting i inquired about this property because i saw myzyris sign my agent didnt accompany me when myzyri showed me the unit brokers wife drafted my offer this basically showed that the other realtor didnt do her job so i wasnt paying her buyers realtors are paid part of the sellers agents commission so i explained all this and on the advice of the sellers attorney i amended my commission statement to give the other realtor a referral fee she cashed the check and called for weeks demanding her money the chicago association of realtors reviewed her case and told her to get lost as a side note many years later i saw that she had her license revoked for multiple ethics violations and now mikes revenge about ten years later mikes new wife died and he called me to sell that house because he was going to move into an assisted living facility while talking with mike he told me about the things he did before leaving the condo the fans had no chains or switches they were operated with remote controls he taped the remotes to the tops of the fan blades and turned them on high before leaving the last time he removed the super high quality garbage disposal that was super quiet and installed the cheapest and loudest one he could fine he shut off all the water valves for the sinks and toilets he poured straight bleach in the toilet tanks he claims that will destroy the mechanisms in the toilet tank or at least drastically reduce the life expectancy he put water restrictors in the showers he removed the wheels from the bottoms of the sliding glass doors and left them in a kitchen drawer assuming bfa would just throw them out assuming they were junk he turned the little pins on the igniter for the attached grill so they wouldnt create a spark he disconnected the igniter on the oven he didnt break it he just loosened the connection i think there were a few other things but i cant remember what they were he said he got a nasty letter from bfas attorney about the doors oven and grill demanding to be paid for the service calls for the repairs he ignored it and never heard anything else about it tldr lazy realtor doesnt do her job but still expects to get paid a commission she winds up with a referral fee because she didnt involve herself in any step of the transaction jerky buyer ticks off a seller who gets revenge by doing annoying things before leaving the condo for the last time 
i guess you could say this borders the line of petty and pro you be the judge so years ago i moved to the city with no job being as young as i was finding a job was pretty hard i asked my uncle if he could find me something at the auto dealership he worked at i found my way into the lube bay oil changes and basic maint i started in the summer and man was it hot hot engines hot oil and just general hotness but as much as i felt like i was in hell i would not let that affect my work i was more than a lube tech i was an a craftsman if it was busy i would make sure every last thing was done new filter vacuum all cornersunder mats record your tire tread depth and rotate your tires if need be if it was slow i would go above and beyond wash the inside of your windows wash your wheels blow out your air filters overall i felt like i was a pretty solid worker and did my job how i would want it done myself all customers are different and unique some are appreciative awesome some could care less most people some are picky not many though and some are just plain horrible this is a story about the latter this woman drove a purple minivan and we shall call her mv mv came in my first week it was rather slow and a greaseball i work with asked me if i would take mv so that he could go home early greaseball loved to go home early and i loved making more money so i said yeah no prob greaseball a lotboy pulls the van up to my pit and i crank out all the engine stuff new oil new filter top off fluids and go through my whole check sheet done no prob now off to clean the car i notice its dirty as im putting on new gloves open then door and it hits me this bitch smelt like a hot asshole on a humid summer day in the ghettos of bombay there were car seats that were speckled by half eaten skittles lolipops and boogers the floors were trashed juice bottles milk shakes cereal everywhere shall i go on ok an empty cd caseand ish dvds scattered abroad tissues with god knows what on them molding chinese food dirty socksunderwearand diapers candy that had become part of the interior mcdonalds bags stuffed with garbage and maybe even part of a dead horse im not even sure so i tough it out and do my whole routine dvds back in the case dirty clothes bagged up garbage emptied floors vacuumed as well as i could and car washed i even got the inside windows done and good riddance by far the worst vehicle i had in my first month flash forward a few months its busy as hell and we are short staffed as its lunchtime my next car pulls up and wouldnt you know it it belongs to mv same purple van same smell same mess and i had to do it so im putting in my new mileage sticker the one we put in the corner of your windshield so you know when you should get your next oil change and realize that has only been ish miles since last change now we all tell you to change oil every miles but that is just a big scam to get money from you guys sorry but its true most cars on the road todaycould go miles or more before they need a change but if you knew that auto shops would loose a huge chunk of business so i go over to my service manager and ask him why they need an oil change its only been k i plead the oil is still good he informs me that mv claimed that i had not changed her filterand that i was going to receive a warning later which could lead to termination if i couldnt correct that error in service that got me steamed literally i always changed oil filters i had heard stories of cheap lube places and how they would not change an oil filter to increase store profit but that isnt me i mean like wow so what ever im steamed but i know after i finish this one i will be on lunch so i crank it out and clean it up just like i do for all my customers and just like i did last time for mv the next hour of leisure was well deserved flash forward a few months and mv is back she is on a service planand gets scheduled oil changes every months i guess the last one was free too because of some loophole or something well a new guy gets mv and i sympathize with him as he gets the first wiff of mvs new winter smell while he is changing the oil i told him to make sure to change the filter and i gave him a paint pen to mark it with we will sometimes mark your filter with a timestamp putting a dab of paint on your filter and engine that way we can tell if it has been tampered with since your last visit i help him make a note of that in our system so that we can see it but the customer cant i had a hunch she would be back and wouldnt you know it miles later it was back and it was my duty once again talk with our service manager show him the note and the markings he goes off to inform mv that the filter was changed and that she would not be getting another service until miles but before i returned the vehicle to her i had to mess with her a little i ever so carefully popped open a crevice of her dashboard and threw a screw in there and put the dash back in place at miles mv was back but this time she went to a mechanic because she needed to get a strange rattling noise checked out so i went over to the mechanic whom i got along pretty well with i told him about our history with her as well as the screw and he got a pretty big kick out of that i asked him to tell mv that it would take a lot of time for that as well as ordering some new parts total cost was about more than the free oil changed that she had accused me into doing best part was the tech told me he wiped off the old filter really well and remarked it and for the first time mv really didnt get her filter changed tldr lady accused me of not changing her filter but i did so i put a screw in her dashboard and she ended up paying to get the rattling noise gone
first of all this is a throwaway account im not from a english speaking country so for the nazis take it easy was told by a friend to tell this story here so here it goes this happened six years ago there had been a new biker gang forming in my home town there were already two other ones at that time but this new gang was being real jerks to normal people and they were annoying as shit this gang had started harassing people at local bars and restaurants just showing of and trying to make a name of them self a few weeks later and they had now started riding their loud bikes through the neighborhoods cunts as they are about three to four times a week between am and about am the police was contacted several times but nothing is changed we in the neighborhood decided to take the matter in our own hands we started talking to each other what we can do that wont hurt them just something so they will stay away we started talking about putting out obstacles and parking our cars on the street blocking as much as possible but still make a hard to ride through making a zickzacking like pattern just so he would slow down bothered so he wouldnt come here any more then we decided that a good old egging would sent a message we talked to all the neighbors told them our plans if they had have enough they should buy plenty of eggs and join us the street i was living on was formed like a u with three apartment houses and about apartments with the window and some balconies to the street we said that we would sit up and just wait for him to come have our windows open because you could hear him from a great distance the first night he didnt come we tried the next one about am i hear him coming the pulse is rising this is it he is finally entering our street he sees the roadblock and slowly cruises forward making as much noise as possible for the trouble we gave him he takes the first obstacle and now the first apartments are starting to launch their eggs hitting him really good on the helmet and his bike we blocked the road so much that if he wanted to turn around he would have to fully stop several times so he just went forward faster thinking it would be over not in this neighborhood he rode though a rain of at least eggs all soaked in eggs from head to bottom as well as his bike he was never to been seen in this area no more victory yes we got eggs on our cars to but it was worth not having to deal with them waking us up at night tldrbiker gang started making trouble in my neighborhood got in one little fight and and got all scared egged
in middle school i wasnt the most popular guy out there in fact i was easy to pick on and admittedly a scaredy cat i hate confrontation i was bullied my whole life since elementary school and even by my friends well th grade year this guy named d for dick had grown accustomed to slamming my books out of hand or unzipping my backpack all the way so that my stuff would spill out pulling my pants down tripping me calling me names and the list can go on for days well he liked to wait for me before my th block out side on the breezeway he would pick on me then but he had started to get more violent i remember to the day when he said im gone kill you youre a fucking mexican not even the cool ones pussy i said okay just leave me alone im gonna be late to class then he said i bet you like cock you fag you want to see it faggot i know you do i saidi really dont want to see it i promise he then proceeded to unbuckle his belt and act like it was his penis i looked away and started to walk away but he threw my shit on the ground i bent down to get it and he slapped me with on the head his belt and was like im gonna cum on you since you like gay shit i head butted him in balls and ran off but i started to cry and pretended it never happened fast forward two days i had luckily been able to avoid him but i had to go the restroom during my technology lab block and so i went to the restroom i go in to a stall and finish my business and as im walking out hes right there skipping class i look down and go to the sink to wash my hands but he notices me he pushes me slowly against the wall and gets in my face you thought it was funny huh hitting me in balls i said no i was just tired of you calling me gay he proceeds to call me any word he can in order to call me gay my eyes start to water and try and run away but again he grabs me says where you think you going fag he again unbuckles his belt and starts to grab it like its his dick he pushes me to the ground as im getting up he slaps me with his belt across the face i pushed but hes bigger and taller then me so it was pointless he then proceeded to unbuckle his pants and show me his dick i just closed my eyes and turned around and crawled out of the restroom i get to class and pretend nothing happened later that day he walks by me and the hallway and yells out if i ever see you try and look at my dick in restroom again im going to beat the shit out of you well everyone there heard it i looked down and pretend i didnt hear anything he said the weekend goes by and i dread going back because i know ill see him again on tuesday in the hallway tuesday comes and i see him waiting standing against a locker in the hallway i was late to class by the way he walks towards me and puffs his chest out i look down and he says trying to look again i just didnt say anything he does the shit with his belt again and his pants were sagging but this time i started to yell leave me the fuck alone a teacher rushes out and sees him holding what looked to be his dick in his hand and rushes towards me he says what in the world is going on i say hes flashing his dick at me and bullying me im crying and he wont leave me alone the teacher calls the principle and the assistant principle i get taken to the counseling office he gets taken towards the principles office and is apparently put in handcuffs by the school cop i didnt want them to tell my parents out of fear that i would get in trouble for not telling them i see him a week later he had gotten expelled and was getting something from his teachers he was being escorted by the principle and looking down people liked him as he was seen as the cool kid but i was the loser mexican kid who had no friends i got a lot of shit for getting him expelled by everyone but no one seemed to care what happened to me edit im sorry for the grammar and any other mistakes it was a lot harder to write than i ever imagined 
when i was i was working in a local theater that i was told would be a sweet job for pocket money turns out that it was anything but i was in a handful of different positions in that place and im not going to make myself out to be a miracle worker i did a good job sure but i made sure to have fun too my immediate manager was pretty cool to boot very laid back softly spoken and liked to talk politics and history it was the upper management that gave everyone a hard time the gm in particular was a piece of shit who loved to berate people if he suspected you of a minor infraction hed nail you to the wall for it anything bigger and you were gone his second in command was no better either she was a woman who dressed in flowing garments and looked goofy every time she came into work i didnt have many problems with them nor they with me in the opening stages of the working relationship halfway in was when they really started hammering people myself included over dumb things i had to stay late after school one day and it was a day off i called them because i didnt have my schedule on hand to check and see when my next day in was it wasnt even the upper offices just the phone that goes straight to the areas i worked second in command picks up the phone and upon hearing that i was asking for information that was literally printed right next to the phone she was using proceeded to berate me for not being prepared i swallowed my pride disagreeing with it but taking it surely she had a point and i shouldve been ontask with it lapse on my part so i shrug it off and let it go i come in the next day and she makes a beeline for me fifteen minutes into my shift with a yellow piece of paper in her hand and a smarmy smile on her face the secondincommand had written me up you are responsible for your own schedule if this happens again youre fired i was fuming this bitch all i did was ask for the next day i came in i never had this problem anywhere else for the record only here so immediately after that i cared less and less about the job every time we got berated and threatened with termination my enthusiasm dropped a little more we were teenagers either still in high school or just out of it and they were paying us minimum wage how much blood were they going to try and get out of this stone i wish i could say it got better but it didnt they would pass up minor tasks a piece of trash on the floor and approach an usher clear on the other side of the hallway or building and tell them to pick it up theyd promise raises and then deny them they even began to deny discounts it wasnt long before everyone got tired of their shit by this point id had enough i was going to do something i just didnt know what yet my favorite thing to do back in high school was stink bombs id crack them off in hallways in classrooms i never got caught around this time the chronicles of narnia was about to hit opening day and i had morning shift management had big expectations for this one and anticipated a lot of business so i had my target i thought about hitting the biggest auditorium in the place where i knew the movie would be aired and then caught myself those little ampoules would get cracked the rotten egg smell would erupt then go away in thirty seconds and everyone would know it was me i needed something lasting something with a lot more staying power than seconds what i ended up getting was a ninepack of liquid ass i didnt need nine bottles but this was when i was a kid and had all the money in the world to spend on stupid things it showed up one day before the big event which had me sweating bullets because i really wanted to do this and was worried about them coming too late when they finally came in the mail pouch i was jubilant i was ready to do my dirty deeds i had my uniform on dressed for another day on the job with two white vials of liquid ass in a cargo pocket as we were about to open ten minutes before we unlocked the doors two ushers acted as lookouts while i snuck into the biggest auditorium in the house i was correct in assuming they would choose this one for prince caspian the carpeted walls acted as the perfect vehicle for the foul substance transparent and silent as it jetted out of the squirt tip i hit the back corridor under the seats and both staircases leading up terminating with the upper row i expected a good lasting effect since id hit the perimeters of such a massive room it really started to work as i was walking out and i got blasted with the stuff as it began to waft i will never forget that stink it haunts me as opposed to the stink bombs and the sulfurous odor i was accustomed to this was in a league entirely of its own the aggressiveness of the stench was something that took me aback and introduced me to a new world of repulsive gaginducing reek it perfectly replicated its namesake an open ass crack satisfied i walked out counting on the putrid smell to do its job i had two minutes to spare no one would sit in there for an hour and a half a concessions worker had asked what was going on and we told him because we knew he wasnt going to open his mouth he got curious and started slowly towards the door he didnt get very far he couldnt even open the door without it hitting him his hands flew over his face with a nauseated groan i got back to work so that i wasnt suspicious and i had a clear vantage point i would not be able to follow people inside but i would be able to watch them leave we unlock the doors and people come in heres where i feel guilty some of them were parents bringing kids along i leaned over the counter and watched people barrel in and then barrel out our management crew was on the scene in minutes offering up rainchecks and refunds along with a weak deodorizing agent they expected sales to go up tremendously thanks to prince caspian this fell through and a witchhunt immediately ensued not wanting my pocket to tip off a manager that something may have been inside i stuffed them inside trash and buried it in other things that needed to be thrown away the asscrack smell lingered and lasted six days before they finally got rid of it when they did i quit tldr i liquid assed prince caspian
so i had a friend in the rd grade well call him chad chad always liked to borrow things from me because at the time my family was fairly well off not once but twice he lent out what i lent him and both times the second hand borrowers lost these items once with a football and once with an nes game one day im out taking pictures with my new camera and chad wants to borrow it normally i would have told him to kick rocks but i had a plan to exact my revenge so i let him borrow it unlucky for him ive been making friends with the person he borrows out my things to yes every time its the same guy so im at the guys house a few days later and per usual hes loaned out my camera to this guy i know because i see it on his shelf and as a bonus i see my nes game peeking out from beneath his bed never found my football though so anyway as his mom calls to him and as he leaves the room i swipe my nes game and my camera and shove them quickly into my bookbag as he comes back i tell him i have to go and made up some lame excuse the very next day i make a show of asking chad where my camera is because i want it back and again he makes a story about how he loaned it out and the second hand borrower lost it at this point i figured either he was selling my stuff to the guy or the guy was stealing it either way i couldnt care less this time i made a specticle i acted like i was fed up and i stomped right down to his house to tell his dad what he did come to find out dad was saving up to buy chad a brand new gokart but ended up paying a good chunk of what he saved to me because of the camera his son lost he was also grounded for a month and heard the belt smack him across the ass as i walked down the street so i got my nes game back as well as my camera and a asshole tax from his dad he never asked to borrow from me again tldr asshole kid keeps lending out my stuff and ultimately getting it stolen so i lend him my expensive camera swipe it from the guy he inevitably loans it to and have his dad pay to replace it
names changed to protect identities of all friends involved when i was all my close friends were at a college hours away from our hometown my plan was to attend the local junior college and then transfer after two years to the same college as them of my close friends had rented a bedroom apartment months in advance the good apartments get booked early it was couples and my bro who was single chandler and monica rachel and ross and joey well rachel and ross broke up over the summer weeks into the fall semester ross couldnt take being around rachel anymore so he moved out chandler calls me and asks me to move in he is like dude just work down here until you are considered a resident then go to the junior college down here becoming a resident would save me a lot of money on tuition joey started telling me about all the hot college chicks down there and i was really missing my friends so i went for it my father found me a good paying job through his work and i moved in life was good for a long time i worked all day and partied with my friends at night at the start of the spring semester our friend phoebe transferred to the college and got a bedroom apartment down the street phoebe and rachel were really close so rachel moved in with her and found a replacement named marcel marcel was our new roommate and was a friend of a friend rachels friend had met him in rehab for heroin marcel seemed cool enough and was clean he was a little wild and crazy he liked to play the bongo drums but we were used to loud music joey was a dj and would play loud music all the time a few weeks go by and marcel started becoming a bad roommate he wouldnt clean up after himself he would stay up to like am and eat all our food he drank way too much and would leave our apartment in shambles we would talk to him about it and he would get better but he would always revert to being a shitty roommate after a couple weeks then i lost my job a job that paid well suddenly i needed to find full time work in a college town it was impossible because every restaurant or store could just hire part time college kids so after a couple of weeks i had to start doing double shifts at a day labor company if you are not familiar with day labor it basically sucks you make minimum wage and they pay you in cash at the end of the day the jobs vary from garbage man to factory worker the majority of laborers were homeless people i would show up at am and work until pm this is when marcel and i start to have real problems i would ask him to keep it down i was really reasonable about it you could play loud music and not wake me up but marcel was playing music at the full volume of our stereo luckily we only had a month on the lease before we would move out and not have to live with marcel i had a car and would frequently drive other laborers to the job site thats how i met gunther who was hitchhiking across country and working on the same job as me we got along right away plus he was and could buy us beer so i offered up our couch as a place to stay while he earned enough money to travel to his next destination i told him about marcel and asked him to help keep it quiet at night monica chandler joey and i were very chill people gunther was the exact opposite gunther had a dont fuck with me personality and was a big dude i am and pretty strong he was just as tall but way bigger than me i brought him to the apartment and introduced him to chandler monica and joey as our new stereo bodyguard it totally worked too marcel didnt pull any max volume stereo shenanigans at am a few weeks went by and it was great finally we had to move gunther and i had pulled a double shift during the day it was about pm when i went to bed in order to be ready to move in the morning gunther chandler and monica decide to get a late night snack together about a half an hour goes by when marcel comes home drunk as fuck he turns the volume up all the way on the stereo and starts dancing in the living room joey comes out of his bedroom with a get a load of the balls on this guy look on his face i had enough so i just go out in the living room and unplug all the wires connecting our dope ass sound system it was joeys and we had to unplug everything tomorrow anyways so fuck it marcel is talking mad shit the whole time i just ignore him and go back to bed about minutes later he starts playing his bongo drums as loud as possible i had forgotten about them so i go out there and am like shut the fuck up marcel starts taking off his shirt and pants he is screaming lets fight lets go pussy over and over i tell him to fuck off and he grabs me by my collar i basically just fall on him and proceed to pin him on the ground marcel is screaming and talking shit the whole time while i pin him to the ground with joey laughing his ass off gunther chandler and monica walk in looking completely shocked gunther is like move i will beat his ass i am like lets just throw him outside we then proceed to throw him out the front door in nothing but his boxers we lock the door and he is just screaming the whole time to let him back in eventually the cops come and we explain the whole situation they tell marcel that we dont have to let him back in and he needs to leave we wake up and starting moving our stuff marcel doesnt show up in the morning we realize we have to move all his stuff out i take his bongo drums down flights of stairs and leave them on the lawn then i am like fuck this bullshit lets just throw his stuff off the balcony it was like a magical ballad of falling boxes rugs jeans and tshirts marcel finally shows up when we are finished his mom was driving in to help him move back home but she wasnt coming until tomorrow he begs us to keep his stuff in the apartment but we just tell him to fuck off he then starts hiding his stuff behind a bush next to the building and then leaves now this is a college town which was pretty dirty all year round with lots of beer cans and litter everywhere so the apartment complex was cleaned only once a year and that was today so a man cleaning crew came and threw everything he owned into the dumpster with all the other trash on the streets we saw marcel digging through the garbage the next day with his mom tldr friends
this is something i would never do again but something that i did in highschool when i was furious a girl call her c i knew was raped another girl call her m was always mean to her and to my group of friends in general this girl bullied anyone who wouldnt retaliate she slept with girls boyfriends she faked being a lesbian and led a girl on for as long as she could for the attention and went after c at every chance she could get so one day when it was known that c was raped and m walked up and told her she was faking the whole thing that the whole story was a lie and that no one would want to rape someone like c i wasnt personally there but when i found out i was furious i had a couple of friends that were younger and being only slightly in my circle of friends anyways i figured i wouldnt be a suspect i gathered my other scattered friends and told them ms name i mentioned that she did something to wrong a good person and that she deserved whatever they could come up with the rumors started about m she slept around a lot so having an std was believable no one would sleep with her anymore this was the only big rumor it ended her ego her friends even believed it i should mention that one of the boys she slept with frequently while he was dating another friend of mine had chlamydia it worked she left c alone and went into her own little world of drama everyone knew one of us did it or started it but i kept my mouth shut no one knew about my friends or about what i started i never heard anything about it again until recently she is still having trouble trying to get a boyfriend apparently they want her tested before they go any farther every one of them this was a terrible thing to do i know this but i got my revenge and c got better without any trouble and no one got physically hurt all i did was ruin her reputation 
a couple of years ago i had a really shitty coworker we worked in it and he was a really bad programmer but thought he was amazing he would add his own middleware that all connections to the database would go through and then decided to do changes in production without telling anybody making our stuff malfunction because of his middleware even worse whenever something that he fucked up did go wrong and somebody complained he looked around the room to see who wasnt there and blamed that person this went on for years and we tried getting the manager to do something about it but nothing happened he also bullied the rest of the it staff on a daily basis and was rude to pretty much anyone not a manager after five years of putting up with his shit we threatened to leave the company if he wasnt fired all of us programmers sys admins everyone gave the same ultimatum to the manager fire him or we all resign on monday morning he was fired that day but wait the revenge doesnt end there a couple of years later i wrote a series of sick humor books the kind of thing you dont want your name attached to when i wrote the first one i thought about what author name to use i decided to use the name of my asshole former coworker now when you google his name you find four pages of amazon pages for his books reviews of them google image search returns his face surrounded by copies of my books the best thing is im making a living selling books in his name i did actually change the spelling of his name slightly so its not the exact same google still returns the books when you search for his name though
ive been lurking for awhile and i finally have a story that i think fits with this subreddit i debated whether it should go here or on rbadpeoplestories but due to the climactic ending i decided to post it here allow me to start off by saying im recently homeless im not going to go into a whole sob story about it but i have shitty credit so nowhere in town will rent to me without a roommate i have no friends who need roommates and i sunk all of my money into rent and deposits on a series of unlivable roommate matching situations ive been at the local homeless shelter for a little over two weeks im a smallaverage early s female who looks younger than i am so i have this very sweetinnocent vibe about me i met a lot of the people here and got along with most of them but primarily bonded with a small group of about people a heterosexual married couple and a former drug lord trying to get his life on the right track i was friendly with everyone else too though including this girl in a wheelchair missing one leg little did i know that she would soon be known to me only as rollercunt and the series of events that would ensue as a result of this amputee trash bag before this all happened i liked to buy nice things for myself i dress in the latest fashions own a somewhat recent model laptop had a ds before i had to sell it for food and until a week ago a nice several hundred dollar phone as well i made the mistake of leaving it next to the toilet in the bathroom one time while i was in a hurry yes i am well aware that it is a bad idea to leave things in bathrooms i dont need to hear it for a th time this week and within the minutes it took me to realize i had left it it had vanished rollercunt was very vocal about i cant believe someone would steal her phone whoever did it give it back while i cried in the corner over the fact that i had just began the hiring process for a new job and now had no way of contacting the company i hoped to work for to acquire necessary paperwork however upon reviewing the surveillance footage from the hall outside the bathroom rollercunt was the only person in there between when i left it and when i went back to look for it later in the day she came back drunk with a guilty conscious told me she had found my phone ditched between the shelter and bus stop but had accidentally left it in her friends car and would bring it back the next day the next day came and her addiction won out she changed her story and said it was a different brand of phone than the one i had then went and sold it for to drink more not long after they caught her on camera stealing cash and cigarettes from someone else and every day from then on they caught her on video stealing something else leaving quickly after and coming back with a pocket full of cash and a bottle of booze stealing is supposed to get the perpetrator banned but they take pity and let her stay because shes a cripple as far as im concerned shes a lying thief first and a disabled individual second and should not get special treatment for missing a leg but lets continue after coming back from selling the phone she asked to buy a cigarette off of me i keep multiple packs on me so i can sell individual smokes for a quarter each and i needed bus money so i agreed she handed me a nickel and i told her i couldnt sell her one for that the price was and not negotiable she started going off about how i wouldnt sell her a cigarette this is what she gets for her honesty i snapped then where the fuck is the phone bitch i know you took it the police came and reviewed the video feed today and saw you going in after me and you want to talk about honesty she looked busted as fuck but tried to deny the police had even been there they had been before wheeling her ass out of the building as quickly as possible and disappearing for awhile never long enough though rollercunt didnt like being called out on her shit so she took to wheeling by me and calling me an ugly slut on a multiple times daily basis i ignored it for awhile since im aware that im attractive to many people she looks exactly as you would expect a chronic drunk to look haggard as fuck and she regularly fucks a rotating cast of guys here in public areas whereas i dont see anyone here like that after about half a week of it though i decided it was going to end one way or another i was sitting in my usual corner watching netflix with my headphones in right before lunchtime people started filtering into the dining area so i started shutting down my laptop to pack away and go eat when i started closing everything out that makes sound i saw her roll by and heard her call me a slut i explained for the umpteenth time what the word slut actually means and how shes confused about which of us it applies to and she starts wheeling around yelling like she wants to fight i stood up and asked her if she was going to do something or just keep running her mouth and she wheeled up in front of me real fast still running her mouth i didnt realize it at the time but rollercunt actually made the first move dumb bitch thought she was going to stand up on her one leg and fight me i grabbed her by the hair pulled her the rest of the way up and threw her out of the chair one of her friends well call him tweak because hes a tweaker pushed a pile of mats stacked next to us over in an attempt to have them land on me but hadnt realized i stood up out of the way they did cause me to lose my balance though so we landed with me sitting with my back against the wall and her entire body in my lap i punched her in the face repeatedly with one hand while ripping out chunks of hair with the other a staff member finally got us to stop i sat there in a daze for a few seconds i dont normally just up and start beating on people and she was laying across my lap crying you pulled my hair i looked at her like she was a piece of shit stuck to my shoe and kicked her off my lap her body comically rolling across the floor the staff separated us i continued to sit quietly in my corner and wait for police while she continued sobbing she pulled my hair sniff she pulled my hair the police came and i remained calm and polite while explaining the situation truthfully they ended up arresting tweak because he had several outstanding warrants rollercunt was asked to leave the shelter for the rest of the day what i think is the best part of the entire revenge is the police decided not to punish me i didnt go to jail i didnt get a citation they didnt set a court date nothing im not proud that i had to beat on a cripple but i did what needed to be done and the fact that i didnt get in trouble for it gives me some sort of pride oh and another upside to the whole situation the fight happened yesterday and nobody has had anything stolen from them since
credit to utixcy for submitting this story originally i thought it was too good not to share first update thank you thank you thank you to everyone for all your awesome ideas on how to catch this bitch seriously there was a ton of replies and i had to get up early because i was working for another girl this morning so i didnt have much time to respond to everyone for starters yes i know i have a shitty manager no big secret most of us hate her but we cant fire her were not corporate either so its pretty much her the owner who run things and hes not around much another thing yes ashley makes an hour im not a business owner so i dont know exactly how it works but of her income is cash from what i understand to get around paying overtime and health insurance the owner pays out the kitchen staff bussers and dishwashers in cash so it looks like no one is working hours a week also ashley makes an hour to pick up plates and put them in a cart she doesnt wash the dishes we have another guy who does that she also doesnt even work close to hours a week so im not sure why her entire check isnt reported but thats just how it is yes were in deep shit with the irs no use reporting it they already know anyway so i called another server nicole last night and just flat out told her everything id written here she started crying and said she suspected someone was doing it but ashley was always such a sweetie and she couldnt believe she would do that she didnt deny ashley doing it just that she felt like ashley had stabbed her in the back over it apparently ashley borrowed from that server a few months ago because she claimed her parents were going to turn her phone off and she felt bad for her so shes stealing and getting money from her too nicole said shed handle it so i figured she meant shed talk to the manager since theyre on pretty good terms when i got to work ashley was already there i made sure to grab any tips off my tables before she bussed them and breakfast went okay when we switched to lunch nicole came over and said hey table left me theres a ten and two ones she said it really flatly and then was like see and pointed at it by then the table was long gone had already paid and ashley just needed to bus it cool as soon as we saw ashley go toward that section nicole amp i walked behind the server line where we could see her we clearly saw ashley scoot the underneath a plate pick the plate up toss it in the cart and then dump it in her apron pockets she left the on the table nicole just said okay thats that then and called the manager over we told her everything about my tips about my friend losing tips and how nicole had noticed it too my manager said basically what i had about maybe a customer did it and then we told her how that table had left ashley took the and left the manager called ashley over and asked her to empty her pockets all she had was the in her apron oookayyy ashley started crying couldnt believe wed accuse her of stealing but my manager sided with us and gave the money back to nicole ashley then decided the only way out of the situation was to make up some huge story about it she said the table came over to her told her what a great job she was doing and told her theyd left a on the table for her at least my manager wasnt stupid enough to believe that manager pulled her into the office and i assume told her she was fired because she came back out crying and grabbed her stuff and left unfortunately neither of us have a record of whats been stolen because we dont know all of it but i told my manager about the guys from friday and how they usually leave me and the table from the other day manager said since we didnt have proof of all of it she didnt want to take it out of what she needed to pay ashley said shed call the owner and ask what he wanted to do about it plus she didnt have proof aside from my word basically that those guys would have left me it sucked but i understand that i guess when my shift ended my manager asked me to come in the office and said the owner told her to go ahead and give me to make up for it and that he was sorry and thanked us for telling them about it not gonna complain about that because that definitely covers what i think ashleys taken from me since i havent work with her in so long i know nicole works with her more so im not sure what they plan to do about that but she doesnt really have any proof or any way to calculate how much shes lost from it sooo fortunately my manager acted like a decent human being for once and actually managed a situation didnt have to mark any bills or get any customers involved thank god so im pretty happy with how it turned out im not really sure how far youre supposed to go in a situation like that but i hope ashley doesnt get a job somewhere else and try to fuck people over and nicole talked to the manager about borrowing to ashley and the manager said she was going to call her parents when she got off that night and tell them what had happened i realize its not really the managers job to get money back on a personal loan like that but i hope for nicoles sake that ashleys parents will offer to pay her back or something edit this isnt my story folks the credit belongs to utixcy alone
im a pretty decent guy sometimes i see ads on craigslist for people who need small loans and i help them out it is always a loan but they need to provide good collateral so i met this guy we can call him dave he needs and i agree to loan it to him he has a hard time coming up with collateral he gives me an electronic keyboard an iphone a digital camera a silver necklace and a seahawks jersey i tell him before he signs the loan document that i made up that he needs to decide now if he is actually going to pay me back he will regret not paying me back i make that very clear to him he agrees and i give him the money and he goes on his merry way i keep his stuff my first mistake was taking collateral that really wasnt worth but i was feeling generous and was bored with life and needed an adventure he had told me that the iphone was a s but it turns out it was a so that was even worth less it was also still attached to his account that was in default so it was only worth parts bummer i should have been more careful when checking that out i know better so that two weeks pass and he is supposed to pay me back he says he cant come up with the money and is willing to pay the late fee that we had built into the contract i agree and again warn him that not paying back wont work out well for him after a month he is now in default and needs to pay me back he starts coming up with excuses of course he uses the oldest one in the book my dad died and i have to pay for the funeral ok i say calling his bluff im sorry for your loss i want to help out if you can give me some proof of his death then ill forgive the loan of course he cant do that and promises he will still pay me back a few more weeks go by and it is obvious he isnt going to pay me back and is completely ignoring me so i start selling his stuff i get for the jersey for the necklace and had the keyboard stolen from my car but then that cell phone he hadnt bothered deleting his data so i start texting his family asking about his dead dad of course magically he contacts me right away again with excuses this time it was in my grief i was so angry that i broke my phone just got a new one today i tell him that he needs to pay me back and at this point he refuses so my next step is i text his exgirlfriend i ask her if she would have any need for daves phone she gets pretty excited and asks if there is any proof of him doing drugs in the last year i find some texts about buying drugs and a picture of him smoking mj i take screen shots and stuff and she tells me she needs that for their custody battle after that i dig deeper into his data hes got a current girlfriend a really cute girl way out of his league but apparently he is also contacting hookers and escorts on craigslist has an ashley madison account and a plenty of fish account so guess who gets an anonymous tip about his bad behavior you guessed it the current girlfriend she freaks out and wants all the info i can give her on top of all his cheating half of the collateral was either stolen from her or was a gift from her she even told me that he kept lying about the seahawks jersey that she had just given him for a birthday saying he left it as a friends house next thing i know im checking his facebook account and he has been kicked out of their apartment and hes now back living with his parents like the loser he is i end up keeping the cell phone for a while and then replacing the motherboard with a good one and selling it i send him this in an email with the caption this is all it took to break up you and your girlfriend i told you that you would regret not paying me back was she worth tldr guy wouldnt pay back loan i got his gf to break up with him
warning relationship story ahead i usually pass on interpersonal drama stories but since i have one im sharing mine just in case its somebody elses cup of tea skip the next paragraph if youre already familiar with borderline personality disorder backstory i once dated a guy with borderline personality disorder i had never heard of that disorder before and he certainly didnt disclose it while we were together but i slowly learned all about it over the course of my time spent with him if you dont know the type he was very intense i felt like we packed three years of relationship into months of dating he had to always be doing something new because sitting still was agonizing he was emotionally unstable but due to being an attractive extrovert he made friends easily and quickly but usually only maintained them so he could exploit them later he was the master of manipulating the emotions of others so that youd do anything he wanted he had a perfect memory and this ability to twist around my own memories of events so that even i couldnt remember what accurately happened he lied about anything just to see if he could get away with it and he was narcissistic to top it all off one thing i should say is that he was hot and i mean he was stupidly ridiculously attractive but somehow was the most paranoid and insecure person id ever met i was young and naive and he was so insanely hot that i thought it was something of a miracle that he was even into me in the first place the sex was mindblowing but he started to use that against me over time too i did a lot of things im very ashamed of as an example of how stupid i was he managed to get me to let him hook up with other women but of course he would get so completely jealous if one of my male friends even vaguely appeared to be hitting on me he called me a whore and slut and insinuated that i did the most horrifically dirty things to men behind his back when he wasnt around i was in my senior year of university at the time so i did a lot of studying on campus with my peers he couldnt stand it he ruined a lot of my friendships and just when i was starting to see him for what he was he managed to get me addicted to several drugs from the party scene that he had access to somehow my selfconfidence was nonexistant at the end of our relationship and i was completely dependant on him for any sort of validation or selfworth story he had moved in with me since he wasis essentially a grifter no credit cards no steady employment no permanent address except those people he mooched off of obscenely heavy in debt because he never paid off medical bills for his numerous trips to the er to score pain meds he always had weird schemes i guess you could call them that to get money but they rarely paid off like he thought they would he had nice clothes that showed off his seriously ridiculously nice body and expensive electronics like his laptop and ipad and iphone but other than that he was a drifter hed go out of town on business trips and yes i know how incredibly cliche that is where of course he was partying sleeping with women and doing godknowswhat to earn cash under the table to this day i have no idea what his regular source of income was but i dont think he was a drug dealer just from what ive learned about him over time revenge im a girl but im a bit of a dork or at least i know how to use computers better than he ever did i eventually found all his hidden laptop pictures and his cloud photo storage i once sat there and watched his iphone upload live sexcapades to his cloud i was an emotional wreck but i kept it together eventually i had kicked enough of the drug habit to operate independantly of him longterm and i started collecting evidence though i didnt know for what i think i just needed something tangible to hold on to to tell myself what i was going through was real so i copied all his text conversations on his phone when he was asleep i copied all his hard drive pictures and then i finally contacted the woman who seemed to be his main girl when he was away from me and gushed everything i had discovered turns out he was essentially doing the same thing to her you could tell he had a type because she was almost a mirror of me darkhaired short skinny but with ampleum tracts of land and totally clueless about the whole thing but unlike me she had a furious temper she destroyed his phone and ipad while he was seeing her up in new york and she had me erase all his pictures off his cloud and then shatter his laptop with my car several states to their south he called me the next day with what was another iphone that he must have bought out of pocket he didnt know about my part of his recent turn of events but i told him i knew what he had been up to and that i set all of his personal effects outside in cardboard boxes and told him hed better collect them before the bad weather we were slated to have over the next several days he was pissed and didnt believe me and never came home that week meanwhile all his stuff sat outside and got rained on all week oh and my cat may have used the bathroom on his nicest clothes before i boxed them up too he eventually showed up that next weekend with the other girl by his side i dont know what was going on that she was still around but i suspect he was owing her a lot of money and that she intended to collect it by keeping him on a short leash either way that was the last i ever saw of him collecting all his ruined personal effects and driving away in a rental car i learned later that when she was done with him the other woman turned him over to the police because he had warrants in four states epilogue he berated me on almost a daily basis for several months afterward alternating between trying to make me feel worse about myself than i already did and then trying to get me to forgive him and take him back he threatened to kill himself and i suggested that he might want to seriously consider it considering i had just given his parents phone number and home mailing address to all the debt collectors that were harassing me at the time he couldnt fathom that i had grown a backbone much less gotten one over on someone as brilliant as him he finally resorted to vulgar name calling and trying to use my demeaning sexual past with him to bring me back down but it didnt work i never blocked him because i wanted him to keep sending me sob stories of how i ruined his life and what difficulties he was having now because of me it was all very empowering he almost caused me to fail and drop out of my senior year of college but i somehow managed to get through by the skin of my teeth and after getting myself clean and doing a little counseling im doing quite well for myself edit formatting and general cleanup im a wordy writing so i have to edit myself down to not sound like im rambling edit i have been informed by several of you that my ex probably had antisocial personality disorder he and i did see a psychologist at one point where she threw out numerous terms that might be applicable to his situation apd and bpd included narcissistic personality disorder was on the list too and odds are he has several things going on at once not one simple thing to blame and speaking of blaming i do want to apologize to those of you with borderline personality disorder who felt that i was attacking him due to his mental issues alone i assure you that my totally awesome revenge was purely due to the actions he took against me like the lying the cheating the stealing the physical and sexual abuse the exploitation and the ruining of relationships of both family and friends i thought the story made it clear why revenge was warranted but if you somehow thought it was an attack on you personally because you share a similar diagnosis with my own personal demons then i apologize thank you for informing me that im just as bad as he was
im on mobile so sorry for formatting quick backstory i ride my bike to the gym with my friend patrick everyday and lock it on the bike rack i get out of the gym look at the bike rack and only see one bike i look to my friend patrick and say wheres your bike he turns and says wheres your bike i soon realize the bike missing is mine my bike cost me for a year old highschool kid without a job thats a fortune i call the police they cant do much because my local la fitness doesnt have cameras i filed a stolen item report a few days later at pm my sister calls me she sees my bike at i throw on clothes and start sprinting its about a minute drive with traffic my adrenaline keeps me running when i arrive i find out that my sister confronted him and he rode off my sister told me it was a homeless man with a ponytail and a tattoo on his neck the owner said hes local comes everyday i was hopeless after a month goes by i looked at every bike i saw today my mom was driving me to the gym and i see homeless men riding bikes in the middle of the road when we pass them my vision was in slow motion it was my bike the guy with the pony tail and tattoo was on a white bike i tell my mom to pull up down the road i get out of the car and slowly walk towards them i scream in my deepest voice excuse me thats my bike i said it in a stern voice im lbs they acted like they didnt hear me and tried nonchalantly riding passed me they didnt speed up i closelinetackled the man off my bike adrenaline pumping i said i said thats my fucking bike the man with the tattoo looked shocked wasnt expecting this to happen we get in a heated argument i hop on my bike and ride home if they ever try to find me for revenge ill kill both of them edit the reason i tackled him off my bike is because he was with the homeless man with tattoo on his neck and a pony tail i wouldnt have done it if i wasnt certain edit im done arguing with people who disagree what i did you will be ignored and i wouldnt fucking kill them for no reason i said if they try and get revenge 
fyi places and names have been changed i was desperate for work and i happen to walk into a store i shop at regularly and was okay acquaintances with the boss he offered me a job and offered to train me up since he needed reliable people in a month i was his star employee filling in for the ones who call in sick fixing problems working my ass off and also smashing sale targets with him saying ill train you since at that point he hadnt besdies how to put through a sale then one day he came up to me and mentioned id been making mistakes and all the little ones were adding up i said but you only gave me basic till training and his response you should know by now then the shift cutting happened and then i found out he started talking real horrible stuff to other employees behind my back the assistant manager actually felt sorry for me but i was constantly badgered like if i even looked away for a second id have my assistant manager going dont ignore that customer two seconds prior they were not even there they literally just lined up or as i said hey im doing this first they would ignore what i said and say yes you need to do that first not x treated like dirt no other employees even wanted to talk to me the plotting so at first i stopped doing things that implicated me in wrong doing as i suspected i was being blamed for stuff i never did i documented it thoughly pictures a diary you name it when my manager went on longer than normal breaks i time clocked it on my phone and wrote it down then he fucked up and wrote a mass text to everyone calling us names for fucking up i screen capped that immediately as the next day he asked to delete that message as it was a prank bullshit he stood over me and watched me delete it i also wrote this down i tried to be friendly with my coworkers but they barely said a word to me but to shut up and keep working my last shift there i didnt know it was at the time i was so over it i was being super nice to people and gave them deals that i knew i could do just to at least feel like a human and get some sort of enjoyment in work this didnt go down well as i got a talking out to with me ending the conversation with i dont really care anymore in the process i was looking for a new job and a day before my performance review by my manager i was offered a new job starting immediately as of tomorrow this was a blessing and i sent a message to my manager that i wont be coming in as i quit he never responded but my asm did and said okay you dont get store discount anymore not even a sorry to see you go but wheres the revenge oh it came i waited months after i left i let the dust settle and then i got everything into order and sent a lovely huge email to my regional manager the thing is they all forgot i was on very good terms with him to the point he was sad that i left i wrote down a few things saying i felt after all this time this needed to be aired out and that i was told i have a legitimate claim for workplace harassment but i wanted to deal with you first i had a huge response saying they would look into this right away an apology that this happened all i asked was to stay anonymous i got a response weeks later saying he was no longer representing the company as a way for me not to pursue legal action after that response i decided to buy something from that store apparently my ex manager did not see it coming they dumped a head office employee in his store to watch him for week and scrutinised everything he did even if he coughed wrong it was noted they then asked him to explain the mass text message of abuse and they used all i sent him plus the head office report to fire him in my country you need a fuckload of evidence to fire fulltime contracts the causals are now being split up into other stores as well to kill the group they still have no idea i did it the asm was shocked as he thinks someone in the store did it for personal gain or a promotion i know it seems perfect but with the regional ive known him when he used to be a causal in that very store and we got along great and kept in contact for years after he got promoted i was lucky in that respect as many people dont have higher connections like that how do i end this well im now in fulltime employment his facebook feed is filled with complaints about no money karma bitch 
not sure how pro this was but here it is anyway a friend of mine put an ad in the local paper looking for a flatmate and had to go through the odious task of meeting and choosing one this guy called her up and was sounding a little weird he started asking her if there was enough room for his suits in the wardrobe and she said that she thought so but he wasnt convinced and kept going on about it she quickly put him in the no category and when he asked for the address she balked and made an excuse about not knowing when she could show him she got his number and told him that shed call him when she had time he called back a couple of days later after not hearing from her and she told him that the room was taken he got abusive and called her a number of names so she hung up this guy called a couple more times over the next few days to tell her what a bitch she was this guy was a total asshole and my friend felt unsafe but luckily he only called a couple of times we waited a couple of weeks and i placed an ad in the free section of the local paper because it was free there was no payment for the ad and no way to trace it apart from the throwaway email address that i made the ad read something like free armani suits im going overseas and am giving away my entire collection of immaculate armani suits first in takes the lot this guy started getting calls at in the morning from every secondhand dealer bargain hunter and who knows who elsei know because i called him at about am and he was going nuts it was hilarious and i wish that id recorded it he figured that someone had placed the ad and gotten the number wrong i ran the ad again the following week with the same results 
this is my story of malicious compliance i used to work for a large heavy equipment rental company we had a large fleet of equipment plus pickup trucks for operators that included fuel pumps for the equipment when on a job site for extended periods of time in the beginning i was a parts runner with the shop manager nosferatu because that is how he looked as my direct supervisor then there was the branch manager dong because that is what he is who oversaw everything dong lived up to his namesake had a military style flat top even though he never served and yelled constantly my sister also worked for this company and he constantly berated her for get this doing her job properly she got her own malicious compliance in but was eventually laid off when the company hit a rough patch turned out to be the best thing ever because she now has a far better job dong continued to talk crap about everybody and any time i would approach him regarding things i heard he told other on my work ethic he claimed he never said it if i am doing my job wrong i want to improve but he claimed i was doing everything right yet when my reviews came around his comments were always negative and i would not get a raise nosferatu and the assistant service manager were fired because they brought guns to work and were firing them into boxes in the office after hours i was offered the role of assistant service manager for that branch and our neighboring branch which also meant the service manager of the neighbor branch was to oversee both well call him gonzo because and became my direct supervisor also i was now considered a corporate employee so dong had no control over my position he tried his best to fuck with me trying to change my schedule make me spend more time in his branch etc and while i tried to comply it wasnt with much effort my boss spent more time in dongs branch and i spent more time in the other because we lived closer respectively and we could divide and conquer the system was working well and we were bringing the maintenance department into the current age technologically during this time the company installed gps units on every piece of equipment that was rented and pickup truck we could track running times for billing purposes and pickups were sending alerts if someone drove over mph really fucking annoying the amount of data i could pull was amazing and we only opted for about of the options one morning a tractor we used at dongs yard was missing it didnt have gps but there was a truck with a trailer capable of towing the tractor hooked up next to the shop on a whim i checked the gps for the truck and the night before it went directly to dongs house and came back early that morning i downloaded a few reports created a new gmail account and sent everything to our corporate office anonymously days later the tractor was back and i never heard anything some time later dong demands that we wire a specific trucks gps unit to send a signal when the auxiliary fuel pump gets turned on simple work and something the company should have opted for to begin with one extra wire but he wanted to set up a certain operator who was believed to be stealing fuel i tried to explain that this is and potentially illegal had no idea if it was actually illegal and dong just screamed at me that he would have his buddies in corporate fire me when he left my office i called gonzo and the head of maintenance to cover my ass gonzo thinking ahead requested if we could start doing this on all of the trucks which the head of maintenance said yes he asked me not to tell anybody but the mechanics about it sure enough the night the operator took the truck home the fuel pump was turned on in locations on his property he was promptly shitcanned and dong was stiff with satisfaction see what i did there months later we have all of the trucks in our branches wired to the fuel pumps and i have long forgotten about it im at work in the neighbor branch while gonzo is at dongs and he calls me from his cell phone gtgonzo hey dude can you pull up the gps on truck xyz gt gtme are you fucking blind it is right outside your office window gt gtgonzo no shit where did it go last night gt gtme now understanding and a couple clicks later dude it went to dongs and the fuel pump was on for minutes gt gtgonzo we filled that tank up last night for a job today gallons and it is bone dry now print the reports and send them to me now i knew my boss was going to report this he had friends in corporate too but i also knew how things get swept under the rug in the company which our parent company must have known when they implemented a third party ethics hotline where we could report anything and dong was adamant about us using it so i did i took the gps reports the video from our cameras showing the yard guy filling the saddle tank and dong later leaving with the vehicle and a summary of what i believe happened all from the anon gmail account the ethics hotline was required to report everything to the company and follow up to get a resolution i knew at the bare minimum i would receive a response my prayers were answered a week later when the head of safety r lee ermey was in our area for his routine visits r like his name sake was a retired marine drill instructor kind as can be in general but takes no shit and isnt afraid to tell you his first stop when he visited was my office as i knew when sending everything to the ethics hotline it would easily be traceable to me i just didnt want it in writing r knew what was up and we went through everything together without saying as much i knew he agreed with my findings he was disappointed i did not come to him first but he also understood my mistrust in the system for previous issues before he was with the company r made the rounds talking to others and got the same general story from everybody that dong was pounds of tube steak by then end of the week it was announced that dong was leaving the company and the two branches would now entirely act as one while remaining physically separate all of our jobs were made significantly easier because nothing was separated anymore and we didnt have a walking phallus spewing off constantly i did it again i never spoke to dong again however he does show up on my linkedin recommendations often every time i see his name i view his profile years later he has no new employer he was close to retirement and he says he is a construction consultant i take constant joy in knowing he gets to see my face for viewing his profile and he can see me moving up at my new company edit added link to why i felt it was unethical per ujbournes question below
this story happened in about years ago i was working for a company that owned intellectual property rights to some automotive aftermarket tech headquartered in phoenix arizona in the owner of the company suggested to his employees the possibility of relocating the whole business to san diego the company was very small only about people in the whole org and all of the coworkers knew each other and were more or less friends either with each other or with the ceo the boss insisted that we all had a vote and if anyone voted against the move the company would stay we all voted unanimously to move to san diego and our first couple years we ended up all living in the same apartment complex in mission valley the new office location was intentionally headquartered across the street from the apartment community which as you might imagine was very convenient in those days i drove a new pickup truck and since my office was across the street i didnt drive my vehicle much except on weekends or special trips as a result the vehicle remained parked for long periods of time in the covered parking area of the garage one day i went out to my vehicle to find a hefty trash bag dumped in the back of my truck naturally i found it a bit creepy and offputting when i hopped onto the bed of the truck to haul it out i found to my utter disgust that it was dripping wet with juices from rancid meat of some kind i think probably chicken at this point i angrily decided that i was going to figure out who did this even if i have to manually sort through every item of trash in this stinking kitchen bag i donned some latex gloves and went to work fishing itembyitem piecemeal from the rotting trash bag eventualy i struck paydirt i found a utility bill envelope that had been crumpled up i opened it up and discovered that the culprit was one of my coworkers who fancied himself a bit of a prankster said offender ill call him cam lived in the same apartment phase as i did just a few doors down first a little context back in those days i was fascinated with lockpicking i owned among other things a lockpick gun which admittedly requires very little skill to operate aside from that it is convenient because they are quicker than using a rake or individual picks i also owned some basic phone testing equipment including a graybar telco lineman testset with some effort i succeeded to locate the telco phone utility closet on my floor and was able to let myself in i dont remember if i had to use an ani line to identify cams circuit or whether the termination points were labeled but i did manage to locate the ring and tip for his pair then using the lineman set i was able to use to activate the call forwarding feature this was sbc atampt in those days i forwarded all of his calls to the local jackinthebox restaurant more context my coworkers all teased me incessently because i refused to eat at jitb because well i simply didnt like the food this would make it subtlely obvious at some point that i was the person responsible since jitb was a running office joke by this time after forwarding his line i crossconnected the ring and tip which shorted the line out status line was dead and calls were forwarded to jitb i let cam believe that i had hacked his phone service providers switch yes he was gullible and let him beg for two days before undoing the damage meanwhile everyone in the office thought it was the funniest revenge they had ever heard of and agreed the response was appropriate btw yes this really happened apologies in advance to rthathappened 
this dates back to when i lived with my parents in a university town we used to have students live next door and a little downhill from us and theyd continually park their cars inside our property near a dodgy fence between our properties their place was full of junk and only had one accessible driveway where one of the longerterm students would always park dad was a lawnproud man and while he was incredibly patient with these guys and would ask them repeatedly to move their cars he hit breaking point one weekend there was a big race in town half a dozen visiting student guest shitbox cars ended up in our lawn and he went around to protest saying itd gone beyond ridiculous especially in wet weather when itd be likely to damage his lawn all the more they promised like they always did that theyd get the cars out and not park there ever again but hey the race was on they all wanted to watch it and have a decent sunday and theyd leave them there until the race was over as i mentioned our back yard was uphill from theirs and part way through the race it really started bucketing down dad didnt show any outward anger but he went into town came back with a few bottles of dishwashing liquid and coated the whole lawn in the stuff come evening some of the guys needed to move their cars and when they got to the downhill slope to go out our driveway found they couldnt steer or brake two made it out without much damage but the third slid sideways got onto the steeper part of the lawn and went straight through the fence and into one of the other students cars and pushed it sideways into the house total damage four student cars with dents one with busted front suspension one wall of the student rental totalled a bunch of arrogant students kicked out and a few skidmarks on dads lawn total cost to my dad four bucks in dishwashing liquid a few weeks lawn regrowth and a brand new fence shared with the new neighbours who were pretty decent people dads response to the police asking about the frothy shit on the lawn white oil kills bugs tldr arrogant neighbours kept parking on my dads lawn so one day when a whole lot of them were parked on the hill he lubed up the lawn and they went everywhere damage caused neighbours to be kicked out problem solved revenge gained
so full disclosure i was reminded of this incident by this rpettyrevenge post which you can find however as a result of what happened due to the revenge i felt that it was worth posting in rprorevenge not trying to oneup usammiesam but himher reminded me of this story that i had to share with you guys if you want more i recommend checking out that story as well as its definitely a good read warning great wall of text is below anyways this is a story that made its way around my graduate school last year i was in a related program but not this specific one masters of public policy mpp students in my school are required to complete what is called a practicum a year long research project where you work with an actual government agencypolicy institute the practicum is supposed to be a project where you demonstrate everything you have learned over the two year program and many students rely on it as an example of the research they are able to produce for job applications once they graduate its an important part of the program and if you dont complete the practicum you dont graduate foreshadowing needless to say it is an extremely stressful project for the mpps and most students take it very seriously of course you get lazy assholes even in very high ranking graduate programs to put it in some context this program is one of the top in the entire country and arguably the best of its kind on the west coast this is a story of one of those assholes getting the ultimate karmic beatdown there were three members of this infamous group two of which pat and ryan were very well known in the program as being very intelligent and driven students however kiran the third member was the complete opposite he was an indian kid that came from a very rich family possibly book smart but nobody knew for sure because he was incredibly lazy and completed stoned of the time even in classes now dont get me wrong i also have a healthy appreciation for weed but smoking right before class in such a competitive graduate program is pretty disrespectful to the professor and your classmates he also got in serious trouble his first year for sexually harassing multiple female international students targeting them specifically to take advantage of their lack of fluency in english and lack of understanding of how seriously american universities take these types of offenses luckily these ladies still saw through his creepy bullshit and reported him to the schools administration since the program is very expensive and only lasts two years the school let him off with a final warning one more violation of the student conduct code would result in his immediate dismissal from the program needless to say at the start of the nd year of the program nobody wanted to be in his practicum group not a single person perhaps in order to give him a fighting chance the professor assigned kiran to pat and ryans group because those two were known to be star pupils they were also the only group that was made up of only males so he wouldnt have the desire to sexually harass them in the intimate research setting that they would be working in for the year naturally kiran did none of work on the practicum barely attending any of the group research sessions and was completely high whenever he decided to give pat and ryan the pleasure of his company this went on for the remainder of the academic year now pat and ryan were known to be pretty friendly guys but they did not take any bullshit from anyone they confronted him multiple times about his lack of contribution to the practicum but nothing ever changed at this point they could have just reported him to the professor who would have removed him from the group and given him the chance to complete the practicum on his own but pat and ryan had a much more devious plan in mind after the th or th argument with him they just gave up on trying to get him to work on the project however they kept him informed about the projects progress emailing him about when they were meeting for group research sessions and what his share of the work would be as expected kirans behavior didnt change on the last day of class groups were expected to turn in the written practicum report and present their findings to the entire class pat and ryan submitted their report without kirans name attached to the report and started their presentation with an announcement that since he hadnt contributed anything to the research kiran did not deserve to receive any credit for the work apparently kiran was in the middle of walking to the front of the class to try and fake his way through the presentation when this announcement was made he stopped midstep his jaw dropped and then silently returned to his seat once the professor gave pat and ryan permission to continue the presentation without him the aftermath kiran pat and ryan were summoned to the deans office so he could hear both sides of the story in an act of desperation kiran tried to place the blame on pat and ryan he accused them of lying claiming they never told him when the group work was taking place they excluded him from participating in the research they were discriminating against him because he was indian etc etc he tried every slimy excuse he could come up with in a sad attempt to save his academic career now remember pat and ryan had documented their attempts to get kiran to do his fair share of the work on the project and were able to produce digital and print copies of the emails as evidence one look at the emails and the dean immediately took pat and ryans side kiran would not receive any credit for the practicum project and since he didnt even bother showing up to class half the time he didnt even have class participation points to bump his f up to a d which may or may not have earned him a passing grade but thats not even the best part the dean in his infinite wisdom and mercy decided to give kiran the opportunity to come back the following year he would be allowed to retake the practicum class again and if he completed his project he would be allowed to graduate with his degree now i dont know exactly how rich kirans family was but after paying over in tuition over two years his family was not going to shell out another dollars for him to come back for a completely unnecessary third year in the program he wasted years of his life of his familys money and had nothing to show for it no degree no professors that would be willing to write him any sort of professional reference no network of classmates that would be willing to help him out in any way at all all because he wasnt willing to put in the work to pass one final course ive gone to a number of alumni meetups since graduation and i can confirm kiran was never seen or heard from again tldr do your fucking part in group work especially in graduate school
so i used to work as a delivery driver for a furniture retailer and it was actually a pretty okay job if you like heavy lifting of course except for my manager brownnoser now brownnoser bn for short was about not all that bright and got to his position as warehouse manager by kissing massive amounts of ass i was a few months older than him and had been there for a year or so maybe a bit less but point is i was one of the more senior guys on the delivery staff so one fine day my truck went out did its deliveries and was back by about pm we started at and usually went to for reference i was looking forward to going home a bit early but bn had different plans for me whats important to remember in what follows is that bn was a salaried worker and i had an hourly wage i finish loading up my truck for the next day and am just walking to the punch clock to punch out for the day when i hear his nasally voice bn hey bedfellow hold on a sec me what is it bn bn i need you to go out and wash

what i tell you me no i have the right to refuse unsafe work and until i fully understand the hazards that these materials present and have all the necessary ppe personal protective equipment i dont feel safe using these products bn stop being dumb just go do it me this is in direct violation of occupational health amp safety guidelines and if forced to proceed i will be lodging a formal complaint both with ohamps as well as bigbossman at this point bn knows he is defeated but im still just warming up bn fine the sheets are this way he takes me to the room with the msds sheets where i spend the next minutes perusing the sheets asking inane questions just to make sure he doesnt leave remember im getting paid by the hour he isnt me well these supplies have the potential to cause skin and eye irritation and this other cleaner needs to be used in a wellventilated area im going to require ppe to protect against these hazards cue half an hour of bn and i rooting around the warehouse looking for rubber gloves that came past my elbows a thick rubber apron rubber boots a plastic face shield safety goggles and a respirator pretty much stuff but it wasnt all in one convenient location like this i don all the safety gear bn is visibly agitated bn you look like an idiot i hope you know that me i look like a safe idiot im alright with that bn alright now will you go wash the truck me ive never used the pressure washer before im going to need to be fully trained on that before i operate it bn theres an on button three power settings and a trigger a year old could work it me i dont feel safe using it until ive been properly trained in its operation i could hurt myself if looks could kill i would be dead but luckily i am protected from his acid gaze by my ppe seriously im fucking immortal under all this shit we head out to the pressure washer and i make him go over everything in excruciating detail again i question everything if theres a kink in the hose could the machine rupture what if it ruptures this is a gaspowered washer what if gas spills ill need a fire extinguisher this takes almost minutes we also have to go find the aforementioned fire extinguisher at this

go into bns office me alright im done bn that was fast me it was a pretty easy job heres all the ppe back thanks for being understanding concerning my safety i drop the ppe in a pile on his carpeted floor it was covered in the mud from the exterior of the truck me i think im going to take off now have a good night bn he didnt reply he just looked like he wanted to cry i left a little after pm that day having wasted almost hours of bns time i found out the next day that he didnt leave til that night i was never asked to wash the trucks again tldr i take my safety seriously even more so when im getting paid by the hour and my cunt hair of a boss is salaried

 or so years ago i was involved in a singles internet community forum pre myspacefacebook days that was centered around my local area here i met up with this gal ill call psycho mary sue pms who started taking an interest in me and in replying to a lot of my posts we hit it off online and soon my online friends in the community began notifying me that she was asking questions and inquiring more about who i was and what i did this was all during a time when cyber stalkers and internet related crimes to persons were all in the news it didnt bother me that she was checking up to see if i was legit it just told me she was interested and wanted to know more we started dating but found out she really wasnt the bringhometoparents type material and overall we didnt have much in common pms was rather crude with language smoked the nastiest cigarettes ive ever smelt and had questionable illegal drug habits i wasnt into the kicker to this winner was that one of the words on her arm tattoo was misspelled important later she was really into me but from the start and wanted a friends w benefits relationship when i said i wasnt interested any further hold the phone just sex only sounds too good to be true right my hormones were in full gear but i was in my right mind to have pms get checked docs gave her the clean bill of health free of stds and the like so everything seemed to be good to go our first few weeks were hot and heavy i started to sense that things were amiss when she became more and more possessive checking my phone and email accounts calling at odd hours and while i was at work back then my ego was about as large as my bank accounts so rather than ending it like i should have i continued thinking i could control her what i did next was a dick move i know but i asked her for a private xxx picture session in sexchange for gifts she didnt even bat an eye and made it clear it would cost me in material goods for the favor i got my explicit photo session with pms and our normal hot and kinky relation continued for a few more months around this time i noticed funny things were happening around my place like my desk drawers appeared rifled through my financial lettersbills just disappeared before i got it the sex was still fun but a nagging feeling kept gnawing at the back of my mind to end it i got the first real redflag when i got a phonecall at work from my bank that someone tried to use my creditcard at a local department store the female culprit with tattoos fled the scene but thats all the proof i had that it was her i confronted her with no position to judge but she denied everything suspicious of her actions i started seeing her less and less of her over the few weeks and through disinterest and mistrust i then called it off the shit hit the fan once i did and i quickly found out that back at the start of the relationship she wasnt just checking up on me she was gathering a portfolio on me she was a golddigger conartist researching her latest claim i made good money had a great job and she felt that it was hers now even though i had bought her things during our relationship other small items in my place of minimal value started disappearing not only that she had no shame in attempting to blackmail me by calling my friendsfamily and even my job pms made it clear that she would pretty much continue this until i gave her from what i owed her in taking and keeping the pictures i had destroyed her name hah by doing so she underestimated me and my influence with jobfamily and friends i was able to persuade them all to ignore her and i filed a restraining order within a few days pms made several attempted to make good on threats after she got the summons pms all but dropped outofsight after a week or so several months later my place was broken into and my computer tv personal records and some sentimental items of little value were stolen the police couldnt find any prints but clearly knew that the thief mustve been familiar with me they grabbed everything of value while disturbing next to nothing that normal burglars go for aka drawers filing cabinets certain desk drawers etc that same day pms attempted to purchasewithdraw money from another department store using a spare atm i kept hidden that she obviously found while raiding my place my pin was easy to figure out and i found out via a fraud alert phone call that this card was being used for the first time opps on her and lucky me she had stolen my computer so she thought all the photos of her were in her possession she forgot to take the backups i had in cds right next to it i gave the police all the sexually explicit digital photos in hopes that the department store surveillance would identify her the female was wearing a hat and glasses and no other positive means of identification except for an exposed armwrist the cops found the misspelled tattoo via her arm the video and were able to positively identify her in the act of fraud i dont remember how long it took felt like months but pms was eventually arrested and convicted because of the photos i gave to the cops i was told by the arresting officer who also handled my burglary that the prosecutor used postit notes to cover up her naughty bits in full poster sized versions of the photos i took that identified her lol i never got back my computer officer says she probably trashed it as it wasnt worth much and some of my personal sentimental items she wanted to use for blackmail but the revenge was mine edited some text 
i got a call from a guy with a heavy african accent he was demanding my immediate attention to this matter he said if he didnt hear back from my lawyer or me within a certain timeframe that he wished me luck i did a little bit of internet sleuthing and realized this was a conman i called back several times just harassing and he was getting very fed up with dealing with me he hung up on me several times and kept telling me to call him at am when the office opened back up i placed a nice craigslist ad up and his phone was probably ringing off the hook all night car siting on s suede leather seats wooded grain steering wheels marble blues motor knocking and transmission starting slipping big blocks what you see is what you get i sleep during the days but worked at night so calling after pm is best calls only please no texts ask for kevin cash firm nothing less no room for nego got more in the rimstires hope he enjoys his phone ringing nonstop update i called today and inquired about the chevy caprice for sale the guy initially answered the phone black amp associates lawfirm i said something along the lines of im sorry i must have the wrong number i was calling about the car for sale he pauses momentarily and says yes it is still for sale you should make out a check for and mail it to some address in miami after that we will contact you back and drop off the car my friend and i just looked at each other these guys are hardcore about scamming some people i kept him on the phone as long as i could asking questions about the car how long have you owned the car its blue right what kind of leather does it have etc etc i probably wasted minutes of his life before he hung up on me i felt bad after posting that ad so i took it down the last thing i wanted to do was help them i moved the ad over the the casual encounters im going to do some more digging tomorrow and actually write down the address then im going to call the miami police department and speak to someone in the fraud department here is what the add originally looked ps i know youre not supposed to give out personal information on reddit if i broke the rules ill remove the screen shot in this instance though i think it is probably best if people have that information since it isnt just one person it is many ive heard that being answered as a collections agency lawyers office and now some sort of car auction house it all depends on who you get when you call in update called miami pd they dont give two flying fucks about it i keep getting placed in the call queue and eventually end up at a voicemail box i cannot speak with someone live im calling from a throwaway phone number so id rather not give them my real information last amp final edit called the ftc fraud division or some shit filed a complaint not much more than i can do the address where theyre telling me to send money is s biscayne blvd miami fl the phone number is if you didnt notice it in the ad have fun with it if were wasting their time they have less time to prey on the vulnerable tldr someone tried to scam me i played along and started to call them back just making up bullshit no matter what they played along with it found out this was a serious crime ring and reported it to ftc hope there is a way to eventually shut it down so vulnerable people dont get duped by them

this is a long story but hopefully my sweet sweet revenge will give you a fraction of the satisfaction it did to me a couple of years ago i participated in a student exchange program in belgium and obviously i had to quickly find an appartement after my arrival i was very lucky and found an incredible offer a nice big loft with a roof garden reasonably cheap and very close to my university the only downside was that current occupier was not the official landlord he had a longterm lease but was forbidden by contract to sublet the apartement himself he was himself going on a student exchange program and had to quickly find someone to rent his apartmenet which is how he explained the rent was so cheaphe seemed like a wealthy trustworthy guy so i didnt mind having an off the books deal with him this ended up being my demise when i moved in the apartment was not in excellent condition he basically left the apartment as anyone who leaves for a long trip would have dishes stowed away and no laundry on the floor but otherwise not cleaned up all the utilities were included in the rent which was a big plus for me considering that it was january and electricity prices in belgium are pretty high the central heating was broken but the landlord was kind enough to buy me two small electric heaters that i could use in the living room and in my bedroom strangely enough my landlord had some kind of defect disease which stopped him from having a sense of smell he warned me his girlfriend would be able to smell if i had smoked in the apartment i never smoked in the apartment although i am a big smoker because the landlord told me he was very opposed to smoking as is customary in many european countries he had asked for a deposit of around euros months rent to be paid back in full on the condition that there were no damages although not in a written contract i still give him the deposit because he left all his appliances including cd dvd collection and speakers furniture television consoles etc which i considered to be collateral as months went by i paid my rent to his mother still in belgium on time had a great time and did no damage to the apartment i had a minimal but courteous email relationship to the landlord which never complained about anything i might have done the landlord came back a couple of days before i was preparing to move out he came to visit the apartment and check for damages and i was expecting him to hand me a brown envelope with the euros he owed me after he had noticed there were no damages whatsoever when he entered he had a clearly fake and exaggerated disgusted look on his face he explained that the appartement was dirty and that i needed to clean it before i received the money which was not part of our verbal agreement mind you i had cleaned the appartement entirely to the best of my capabilities and to an extent any landlord would have found more than reasonable he proceeded to show me all the wall stains almost all of them already there dust under the oven yes under the oven rust on some pipes under the sink etc basically he wanted me to clean the apartement as if he was about to sell it and remember the apartment was definitely not cleaned when i moved in he offered to pay and go get some cleaning products for me which he would bring back shortly i assumed he would also help me clean with his girlfriend but nope he came back and basically ordered my girlfriend and i around like maids while he and his girlfriend were doing nothing this was still to date the most humiliating frustrating experience of my life i knew that i had to obey his commands because i would never get my euros back if i didnt i probably could have legally challenged him somehow but i was leaving the country a few days later and i preferred to swallow my pride and move on with my life scumbag landlord after hours seemed pleased with my work and instructed me to meet him at a caf the next day to hand over the cash i arrived at the meeting early the next day hungover as hell ready to get my cash and get the hell out of belgium my flight was the next day he did not have the cash with him after i left the day before he had called the utility company and realised that he had an outstanding statement of around euros apparently those little electric heaters consumed energy like motherfuckers i could should have anticipated this but as the utilities were included and i had never through of checking the evolution of my electricity consumption on the meter which i had to unscrew a plank of wood to access anyways scumbag landlord after having made me clean his apartment like a little bitch was asking for the euros i owed him he himself had always paid the utilites from the central gas heating and did not anticipate a rise in electricy bills after giving me the two electric heaters that son of a bitch was even threatening to show up at the airport the next day and stop me from leaving if i didnt after myself calling the utility company we went together to their offices and realised the balance was actually something around euros not the landlords mistake i only received euros in return i had never been so furious in my life and could barely stop shaking for the next hours i wanted so much to get revenge but i only had one night left in the apartment i was also legitimately scared that he would show up at the airport i should mention that he was a big guy and a muay thai fighter i had to somehow delay the effects of the revenge so that they would be only notibeable after i was gone this excluded the obvious damages to the property which was my initial idea thats when all the pieces fit together in my mind and my evil plot was hatched after sharing the idea with my girlfriend we went to the nearest fish store and bought something like euros worth of fish leftovers usually purchased to make fish stock or soup my best estimate is something like kilos of fish bones etc for the next couple of hours i blended the fish with a lot of water cived out the chuncks and filled up spray bottles with a murky but very liquid fish mixture i sprayed that fishy water everywhere but i really mean everywhere under the over behind the furniture on the floor the walls the ceiling between the drawers of his desk under his mattress and even on the clothing he had originally left in storage when i moved in there is no way he could smell the fish and he probably would not have received complaints from the neighbours until they were rotten and stinking out the whole building to this day i do not know how my fishy revenge turned out i can only imagine that his friends told him he smelled like shit andor that his apartment smelled of rotting sea creatures by which time it would have been too late to reverse anyways it probably cost him a shitload of money to professionally clean his house and i sincerely hope he is still paranoid about smelling like fish but nobody wants to admit it to him tldr scumbag landlord took advantage of me and did not give me back my deposit knowing he has no sense of smell i took revenge by spraying fishy water all over the apartment which he probably realised way after it smelled of rotten fish

i had posted this earlier on under a different title in rpettyrevenge however i felt it was rather extreme for a pettyrevenge post so i put it down here as well anyways after seeing this about how op got revenge on an obnoxious shit and his friends during halloween i thought id post my halloweenrelated story on here as well now its pretty long so please bear with me alternatively feel free to skip right down to the revenge part background in the area where i live theres this community service centre and during halloween we get to volunteer to take part in haunted houses haunted rooms would be more accurate because theres multiple groups and we only get a large room to work our magic in as staff members the main visitors are around meaning that our rooms have to be scary but not too scary the first year this happened the workers ended up with a lot of crying kids on hand so the years afterwards had limits on how scary it could be well back in there was this year old shithead well call him fuckass who started coming he kept on going into haunted houses and making really snide comments the makeup looked obviously fake what do you expect were not professionals were just a bunch of teenagers who want to bring the halloween spirit alive none of it was scary the actors were too young and even a room filled with fluffy pillows was scarier those were just some of the remarks we werent happy but we shrugged and let it slide figuring he wouldnt be back boy were we wrong rolls over and he comes back pulling the same shit whats more when he got out of the attraction hed tell others what was in it and ruin the entire damn thing come and i was team leader this year my group mates were all dreading it because we knew hed probably come around and do it all over again sure i have a few skills i didnt show but we cant have cards flying around and people popping out of nowhere constitute the entire house can we however as a seasoned veteran ive met quite a few people over the course of those four years one of them was this guy who well call tommy and he was a whiz at woodwork for example on my first year doing this we had this spot where there would be a vampire rising from the grave which called for an actual coffin theres no way were buying one and he was the one who made it from thin boards of wood a week before the entire thing started planning now tommy was also a devilishly clever person who did not appreciate his experience for the past two years being ruined so he flipped a switch and changed from his usual polite gentleman mode to his bastardcoated bastard with extra bastard filling mode and when i contacted him asking him to join my group he accepted proposing a plan during the time between and he had taken his woodwork to a whole new level forget the coffins he could make a table with so many gimmicks and secrets that it would take an entire month to discover them and he was going to do exactly that in addition to tommy i had also recruited a couple of other people who had been on the receiving end of fuckass douchebaggery and wanted to get back at him then another group heard what we were doing and decided to join up with our team meaning that we were given the largest room which was at least four times larger than the other rooms our now something strong group put our heads together and we plotted coming up with scary sights well beyond what we usually would do at the centre there would be no fake mannequins in place of bodies nor would there be any tissue paper doubling as scabs and wounds we were determined to do the best we could and give this asshole his due for the month leading up to halloween we worked as hard as we could to get it all done recording sounds shopping communicating over google docs we worked our asses off on it just to make sure we could deliver that karmic kick up his backside finally halloween rolled over i met up with tommy and several others at the centre especially early well before any of the other groups were even here we spent the next three hours getting the place set up and by cleverly draping up the black swathes of cloth we were provided with we turned a large room partitioned by sliders into a labyrinthine dark horror where we waited to give patrons the scare of their lives after a quick lunch the performers arrived four of who were hefting a large table needless to say the table attracted quite a few stares holy shit what the fuck is that oh just a surprise that we have in store for the sucker tommy gave the people asking his signature im about to wreck some serious shit grin as the hours rolled by our justice squad labored like an army of ants the makeup artists started working their magic and slowly horrific injuries bloomed on our actors from gashes to scars from flesh rotted away to reveal bones to mangled limbs and missing chunks of flesh they either looked like they just came out of an accident or could pass themselves off as the freshly reawakened dead come back to haunt the living alright i might have exaggerated a bit but you get the idea meanwhile back in the haunted room we went and having checked that it was partitioned like we wanted and all the decorations were here started laying out everything needed first we divided the materials based on what went into which section then we all split apart and decorated the sections we were responsible for before converging again at the table which tommy had decorated while we werent around tommy turns to me a smirk adorning his face lux should we tell them about the table i nod and tommy grins so guys as you can see theres several dishes silverware and those fancy lids all laid out on the table right cue a round of uncertain nods tommy reaches over lifts up one of the lids and everyone is greeted with a head on a plate eyes closed shaven head blood around the neck then the head opens their eyes and lets out a shriek pandemonium ensues the rest of the team let out yells of alarm as the head laughing disappears from view moments later the head with the body attached crawls out from under the table before revealing that the plate was not actually a plate but was painted on the cloth itself peering over reveals a hole in both the cloth and the table itself with two slats near the bottom of the table these slats were movable so the actor portraying the head could slide the slats apart stick his head through the hole then slide them back to complete the illusion a little further along the table theres a similar but smaller mechanism for someone else to do the same with their arm and on top of that hole we plopped on a pile of fake arms before drizzling them with a shit ton of fake blood to camouflage the arm fast forward a couple hours and its now thirty minutes before game time the actors have all sated their hunger and have also run through the entire thing a couple of times now theyre just chatting and mooching around tommy and i are worried though what if fuckass doesnt turn up and all our work was in vain i sneak out and hide behind one of the numerous veils hung up in the hallway leading to the corridor with rooms where the visitors are gathered and from my vantage point among our sea of faces i spot a familiar one jackpot i run back as quickly and quietly as i can telling tommy tommy literally jumps up from his seat and calls everyone together he tells them to relieve themselves put their stuff away and get their shit sorted out because theyre going to start business five minutes before opening everyones getting into position and exchanging small talk i myself am tying one of the makeup artists to a railing she volunteered to be one of the victims in a slaughterhouse scare zone when we hear commotion outside i go out to take a look and see fuckass as well as some of his scumbag friends trashtalking the team leaders of one of the other haunted rooms i step in and tell him to fuck off and he responds by going yeah im not scared of your stupid attraction i saw how lame it was last year lets see you say that after you get through it revenge the haunted rooms event last for two three if theres a lot of people hours and during this time we got several visitors we gave them the normal version of the journey where we dont pull off the really horrible tricks yet those are reserved for a certain jerkwad the journey also varies slightly with each one we arranged the partitions so that we can have more than one potential route for example certain rooms are skipped out if there are young children like the mad slaughterhouse the order of rooms shown is mixed around and sometimes the rooms are not seen but heard its never really the same with our house after around an hour of scaring we get a little rest break the lights are on the windows on the door are covered with black pieces of paper and were all chilling then there is loud rapping on the door i move one of the pieces aside and see fuckass pounding on the door his cohorts snickering as well we were pissed i mean who the fuck does that we decide fuck it if he wont treat us with respect then we wont hold back on him either the guy at the door tells them to be more patient and that they would get to go in as soon as they us scarers were ready they lay off the knocking and we spend the rest of the break preparing for his arrival the only thing fuckass and co saw were one or two of us running out to the toilets and getting some water finally the trap was set fuckass and his friends swagger in completely unaware of what lay in wait for them like a suckerfish to bait the first thing they noticed was the mist drifting out of a cauldron the actress who is playing the role of a hideous old crone is faced away from them hunched over and muttering stuff she turns to them and tells them the story with a twist instead of the usual introduction to how they should make sure to obey the rules she just says something about how they should be careful for dark things evil things lurk ahead enter at your risk fuckass and co shrug and walk on through the shroud of mist formed by the co pouring from the buckets above now this is where it starts to diverge from the normal path remember my skills because as soon as they clear the veil the first thing they see are several cards coming at them at as high a speed as i could make them of course i aimed to miss but barely and so that it whooshes past their head what the hell was that cohort asks oh man up i was right this is still lame fuckass laughs but is that a slight silver of anxiety i hear in your voice well they got through most of the attractions i think they started to crack when they got to the mad slaughterhouse there was fake blood and actual pig organs in there as well as a couple of people playing victims and from there on it only got worse and worse by the time they get to the dining hall theyre starting to shake and sweat visibly the butler played by tommy invites them to sit down and ignoring their sounds of protest shows them to their seats then he takes out a silver bell and rings it and lo and behold the flycovered people with their heads resting in plates of rotting food come alive blinking dazedly they look around blank looks in their eyes i think i saw one of the friends pale when a zombie stared them in the eye tommy lifts open some of the covers on the dishes roasted fingernails bug salad drizzled with rainwater vinegar boiled heart yes it was a real pigs heart earthworm pudding tommy took great pleasure in describing each and every one of the dishes in graphic detail taking pleasure in making the fucker squirm then after all that fuss only one lid remains uncovered at this tommy puts on an air of excitement rubbing his hands and muttering to himself how the last dish would give them the greatest surprise of their lives the zombies moan and groan taking the cutlery and thumping on the desk with it tommy slowly agonizingly takes hold of the lid and the thumps get more and more frantic finally in one swift movement tommy yanks the cover away and yells behold fuckass and his cohorts catch sight of a shaven sheet white head with blood around the neck but only for a second because the next second the head has opened their eyes and let out an unearthly shriek and unfortunately for fuckass tommy sat him down so that when the head comes alive they are facing his seat looking right into his eyes what ensued was possibly the most glorious moments of my life fuckass and his friends let out loud screams of their own and knock over their chairs in their haste to get out however a real arm snakes out from the pile of arms and swipes at them making them scream even louder the zombies moaning tommy yells i hope you enjoyed your dinner as they run past theyre in the last room now theyre looking around and they cant see the door which is covered by a black curtain i wait until theyre looking in the wrong direction then quietly draw back the curtain and hide when they see it they practically stumbled towards it theyre so focused on the door they dont notice me sneaking out of my hiding spot and assuming a position near the door i hope you enjoyed your stay mad cackling i still remember the surprised yelps they let out when i made my audial debut needless to say after being on the receiving end of what we call the great scare of he never tried to stir up any trouble for the rest of the time he was here tldr when you are such an asshole that an entire haunted house redesigns and actually creates features specifically to terrify you it might be time to reevaluate your behavior edit changed tldr to the contents of ujintesss comment

first and foremost let me emphasize that this story is entirely centered around my friend and his family i had littletono involvement in this whatsoever obviouisly names have been changed the story begins with my best friend otto winning tickets on a cruise ship to cozumel mexico he first offered to me but i was single at the time and to quote myself didnt want to waste a cruise ship notfucking so he reaches out to his sister jane jane is ecstatic and asks if her boyfriend steve can be invited in tow and otto gives the thumbsup so its otto and his fiancee claire his sister jane and her boyfriend steve again this story was told to me and im repeating back to the best of my knowledgeability the cruise is about days and for the first everything is going swimmingly theres plenty of drinks plenty of dancing karaoke gourmetish food and entertainment and theres plenty of time left before even reaching cozumel everythings going well until the rd night when jane knocks on ottos door crying and shaking she didnt look that bad since she wrecked her car that one time otto told me the morning after jane was reticent and very reluctant to give any details but she had asked to sleep with otto and claire that night she cited the reason being that she and steve had been fighting and didnt want to be in the same room as him red flags were waved but otto was pretty cool with steve at that point so he waited to gather more details the next day claire and jane talked at length and jane finally admitting that apparently fighting translated into rape steve had forced her down while they were both tipsy and jane wanted to sleep it off otto was pissed but he was also fucking unbreakable they were going into a foreign country and there were opportunities however it was established that jane would be sleeping with claire and otto would be rooming with steve otto wasnt happy but my buddys fucking unbreakable he looked the fucker in the eye and smiled knowing full well that steve would get his steve on the other hand was told that jane just needed to cool off and that nothing was wrong hes not naive but he bought it day and they arrive in cozumel as soon as they step off otto and claire tell steve to give them all of his belongings steve gets suspicious but is diffused when claire explains that this place is loaded with pickpockets who know how to steal from tourists well hang back steve went off with jane having conspired with otto and claire he had only which was quickly borrowed by jane who asked sweetly if steve could lend it to her while she looked for a nice pair of shades steve never saw the money again nor has he seen jane as far as i know his cell phone it thrown into the gulf his wallets cards were cut up and tossed in the trash while his cash was used to buy lunch and some souvenirs his id card which would get him back into the ship lost with his passport in the gulf i dont quite know the details about how a missing passenger is dealt with otto didnt give me any details on the matter but he did make it a point to tell me that steve didnt speak spanish and hell be there long enough for someone to go all cartel on his ass hopefully while i suspect otto bribed the staff to count steve as present id rather not implicate my best friend for something i dont know nor do i want to the rest of the trip was decent but nothing like a cruise jane was in bad shape the rest of the way and most of the time was spent with her helping her calm down and talking her through her issues there were drinks some gambling in the casino and some really fun moments but steve had left his mark and the return home was a welcomed sight bonus steve still hasnt been heard from while janes been seeing a grief counselor and making strides to move on from the trauma steve caused her i got to be the best man at ottos wedding and claire is expecting her first child with otto in months tldr best friends sister gets raped rapist is left stranded in a foreign country once again this submission is not my own encounter names and locations have been changed for anonymitys sake im retelling this story to the best of my knowledge and ability and apologize for any important details left out
so for those of you who read my last story i figured id share this one because i had an update ill get to that after the story though alright so my friend daves little brother always had a gang around him which we tended to call the fiends there was a line in fear and loathing in las vegas where theyre bumbling around high on ether and the character says something like you fiend when hes referring to the other character it stuck and became our little insulting name for the group of habitual drunk year olds we honestly used to sit around and watch them because they were amusing for this i am using the real nicknames we knew them for at the time seriously youll see why i had to ad this disclaimer in a moment anyway there are main players in this story first well call rabbit because it was his nickname i have no idea why he was a sniveling little bastard who was sure he was smarter than everyone else around him in spite of great evidence to the contrary next was a kid we knew as monk i have no idea why this was his nickname either was was generally a cool guy always had a skateboard on hand because s and was pretty well known as being almost impossible to anger ok maybe that was why we called him monk next was monks girlfriend the head monster i know exactly why she had this nickname who was a pretty nice girl yes she did earn the nickname when she was single but she was totally devoted to and in love with monk cute too really so one day the fiends are all out getting something or other probably cheap beer and pot thats like lawn clippings and its just a few people at the house dave and i are in his room the head monster and rabbit are in the living room downstairs dave and i decide to take a break from probably goldeneye something for the n i cant remember upon walking down stairs we look into the living room and see rabbit laying on top of thm and trying to remove her pants now she appears to be unconscious at the time so he wasnt really having any issues when he sees us he instantly gets up and bolts out of the house as fast as he can running is what this kid was best at because getting his ass handed to him was the second best thing he was good at we would have chased him down but ive always been a fatass and dave was checking to make sure thm was ok she was out cold and we being stupid teens reasoned it was better to zip up her clothing and not tell her what happened we figured it was better than waking a drunk and telling her hey someone just tried to rape you because once again we was morons we did however decide to tell monk in case he wanted our help beating the shit out of rabbit we told him what we saw and he frowned slightly at the information he only did that for a moment or two before smiling at us and saying hey dont worry about it i can handle it and then wandering off cue months an amount of time later its safe to assume at this point rabbit somehow thought he had outsmarted us or ran too fast to be seen because he started showing up around the house again to hang out with daves little brother he acted like nothing had happened and chatted like he wasnt a gigantic piece of shit so one day were sitting around with the fiends watching something on the tv rabbit is casually sitting on the edge of the coffee table talking shit about someone who wasnt there at the moment and dave and i were just kind of wishing we could break his knees cue monk showing up and things unfolding like this monk hey dave hey isst good to see ya walks directly over to rabbit monk hi rabbit picks up his skateboard and smacks rabbit so hard in the teeth with the truck that blood splatter somehow ended up around a corner in another room monk sorry about the mess dave take care guys turns and leaves the house without saying another word the best part of that is that rabbit was such an asshole that no one in the room questioned why it was done as soon as we heard the front door close everyone in the room burst out laughing while rabbit was on the floor crying never saw the shit weasel again after that day update for people that read the last story i posted i actually found and got into contact with dave it literally boiled down to me searching through everyone on facebook with his name and looking for the weird ass bands we both liked in his interests hes doing well family and all that and is far far away from that house edit shit left out the my favorite part
this is a throw away account so i dont link this story to my original account also sorry for the grammar because english isnt my first language and im typing on my phone a little backstory first my dad was one of the first geologist to go and work in the gulf in that time dubai was just a desert so we a very well off family my older brother have quadriplegia and cant talk caused by complication during birth every time we get back to our motherland we go back to rural town where my parents were born and raised and away from the city because traffic noises always made my brother jump and his muscles stiffen for few seconds if he heard a loud noise like car horn it was summer vacation my dad went to the city to do something related to work there and mom left to visit a relative in the hospital so me and my older brother were left to the babysitter dont know how old i was back then but i was still in elementary school so the babysitter decided to put my brother in wheel chair and go for walk around the town and visit the park there while i decided to stay and play around in front of the house with a friend the babysitter came early and red eyed because she was crying apparently when she was taking my brother to the park some fat little fuck had some fireworks which made my brother jump and stiffens the kid noticed that and found it funny by throwing fireworks toward my brother and making him jump then calling him a retard the babysitter told him to stop and tried to chase him only to run and come back again throwing fireworks in the end the fucker managed to throw plastic bottle and hit my brother head then my brother broke down crying the babysitter managed to catch that little fat fuck but his mother who also massive fat fuck told her not to touch her kid the babysitter told her that her son was bullying my disabled brother the fat fuck said that she was to blame and she should keep that thing inside the house this was the moment where the babysitter started crying and took my brother home after finishing telling me the story my brother cried not because of the bullying but because he felt he couldnt defend the baby sitter i was kid back then and my heart sunk inside now i mentioned that we were very well off and because my brother liked videogames so we had every console out there from atari to nintendo and sega system with ton of games and big crt tv and my brother loved to watch more than play so we always had kids come to our home to play with us one of them was our neighbor kid who was freshman in high school and very close to my brother so we going to call him my brother from another mother mbfam so i went and told him the whole story and he was furious he went and called some kids to gather information about this little prick apparently one of his classmate knew he is sadistic fuck who liked to take puppies and put them in front of stray dogs if you dont know stray dogs will attack any dog who come near their territory so one of the kids went to his house and told him that they found a dog and he should come and see it the nave little shit went straight to the trap where we send him to area where there is no houses and people around me mbfam and couple of kids get him surrounded mbfam said i heard you bullied my brother from another mother and he pushed him the kid said in tearted up voice stop mbfam said you want me to stop now why are you gonna cry did you stop when he cried then another kid pushed him every time he wanted to get up a kid pushed him to the ground then one of the pushed into a puddle of mud then took off the fat kids shorts so to looks like he shat himself and all kids started laughing dude why did you shit yourself the fat kid started squealing and ran straight to his house mins later he got his mom banging the door and screaming like crazy mad screaming the babysitter was scared shitless and couldnt dare to open the door that until the sheriff came it must somebody called him because it was a freaking circus in front our house a fat bitch and her spawn and shit ton of kids i felt like all the kids of the town gathered in front our house the sheriff came to see what the fuck is happening of course the fat whale started to scream incoherent word saying words like this little twigthis thingmy poor baby then the babysitter opened the door and told her side of the story how the kid started throwing fireworks and making my brother uncomfortable then the whale interrupted then the bitch shouldnt took that retarded outside the house in this moment the sheriff said shut your fucking mouth he isnt retarded he is physically disabled and he smarter than you and your son so go back to your fucking home before i arrest you for domestic disturbance everybody could see the fear inside the whale eyes she took her spawn back with the cheers of kids all laughing around her now the kid have been known of kid who shat himself my parents came back home i dont know what exactly happened but the father came to apologize and their house was getting vandalized every day for a week or something years later i came back to our little town for relative funeral i catched up with mbfam and he told me this gtthe father of the little kid was a truck driver who was never home gtthe kids was spoiled by his mother and even in high school he was a little shit gtthe father died so the kid go his inheritance ransacked the the house stealing his mother jewelers or anything expensive in the house gthis mom was left with little to no money so the community

 a few years ago i was going through a series of shitty events regarding my girlfriend and her infidelity turns out she had slept with one of my friends and also blew another one of the people i knew a few days after finishing things she tells me about all the other times she had cheated or at least all the times she remembers and even laughs about it to my face im with my friends drinking later that night when my ex texts me asking to have her bikini back that she left at my house lightbulb we have my buddies girlfriend drive to pick up the bikini and more beer while we stay at the house now the weather had been below freezing for the past couple of days so everything outside was frozen solid our night progressed and eventually nature had to take its course this is when my revenge began after half a night of hearty drinking my two friends and i had become quite full of urine so not wanting to waste such a golden resource we decided to save most of our piss that night in a one gallon ziplock bag with the bikini inside the bag and the three of us peeing at regular intervals by the next morning we woke to find our vessel had become a solid frozen mass off different levels of urine with a stark contrast between two of the layers it was a pretty nasty sight to behold not only was the night with my friends cathartic but i felt a sort of pride in the piss bag knowing that my ex would think im a fucking lunatic and hopefully wont try to contact me ever again since i hadnt replied to the text my ex sent on day one by day two she had sent me another to which i rather lazily responded a few hours later with its on your porch i had been back at my house not ten minutes before i had a call from my ex in a seething tone your mother will hear about this which i thought was rather petty and funny since my mom wouldnt care since she didnt like or trust my ex to begin with once off the phone with my ex i get a call from my mom having he tell me all about how angry x was and how she didnt do anything to warrant tha this should probably go to rpettyrevenge but i felt like i piss is a little too gross
sometimes the easiest way to deal with an asshat is to get accountants and the government involved it all started out normally enough through some acquaintances my so and i met a couple thatd just recently moved close to where we were living we attended their house warming and spent a few other nights hanging out itd really be nothing to write home about if my so hadnt come to me asking me why the guy in this other couple messaged him letting him know that his girlfriend was convinced that i was trying to steal her boyfriend if that sentence left you confused i was too the girlfriend didnt say a word to me but spun some tale to her boyfriend who also didnt say anything to me but started messaging my so this nonsense the boyfriend unattractive doesnt describe him but it starts to come close if he was the last man on earth id become very familiar with my right hand as you might imagine its hard to definitely prove that you didnt do something and it wasnt just flirting that i apparently engaged in according to them i was apparently running my mouth about all sorts of stuff and causing issues for them i apparently told nameless others that he was cheating on her and that she was cheating on him and that she was only in it for the money and on and on im saying nameless because they were never produced because it never happened im convinced that it was something she made up it became a they said she said with my so in the middle redditors i honestly didnt do any of the shit that i got accused of it was all catching me totally off guard i told them to piss off and broke all ties two months later i get a message asking me why i was sending snail mail letters to the boyfriends mother implying that the girlfriend was a stripper and a whore i didnt know the mother or the address and thought that the girlfriend was a dramawhore but not a streetwalker this time id really had enough i didnt want them and their drama making regular reappearances in my life a conversation that id overheard between the boyfriend and another guy popped into my head while i was seeing red the boyfriend owned his own company and had been bragging about how he didnt pay his taxes and neither did his company i know my way around the internet a little bit so i started researching him and his company i took screenshots of what i found which included two different instances of him confessing to the tax evasions on social media sites i read far too many comment threads and posts of his and discovered his presence on some eye raising sites in the process i took what i had and both mailed hard copies to a few local irs criminal investigator agents as well as emailed it to them after i was done looking up the boyfriend and his companies i started looking up the information of people in the local irs office who would be tasked with investigating him i corresponded with one of the irs agents briefly and then there was a silent pause in which id considered it all going nowhere and then i heard it through the grapevine irs agents had shown up at his home they had investigated him and his company together he owed something close to million in back taxes itd been years since hed paid both he ended up having to downsize his lifestyle a bit to start making the payments i know hed started hiding some of his assets by putting them in her name so i know that the girlfriend got dragged into the investigation too i think that it all freaked his girlfriend out and stressed their relationship because she ended up leaving him shortly after it all started i still honestly dont understand what the point of all of the accusations was my so doesnt have any insights either i know i probably should have directed more of my efforts towards the girlfriend but he was the one who unknowingly and unintentionally gave me some nice ammunition to extract some revenge against the both of them hes now working to pay what he owes and shes now living at home and working in retail they dont talk i havent heard a peep from either one of them for the last almost years so im satisfied with how things ended they dont know that it was me who give the irs much of what they needed
a long time ago no just years ago in a galaxy far far away no just streets over i rented a nice big flat in a nice old fixedup house house was foreclosed but the stupid property management company that managed it for the bank did everything wrong first of all it didnt notify me of the change of landlord so i kept paying the rent to the old landlord who did not cash the cheques after months i get sued for not paying the rent in court when its my turn to speak i ask who the fuck you are my lease says mr soandso and youre not him er they could not produce proof that they officially notified of the rent transfer case dismissed said the judge of course i received the proprt rent transfer pronto after that oh well i was stupid and young at the time and i did not think it could be that when the registered mail came in and i stupidly took it it was nice while it lasted but still months rentfree then the stupid property management decided to sell the house for the bank its one of those typical montral houses with the big stairs outside and they put the for sale sign on my stair at orkplace i printed huge sold sign on dayglo cracknpeel and when i come home late at night i stick one on the for sale sign looks totally official it takes them weeks to notice the sold sticker and they scrape it off of course days later another sold goes up and stays for another weeks rinse lather and repeat it took the bastards months to sell the house
a coworker told me this story today and i asked if i could post it here for you guys to enjoy sorry if its more of a rpettyrevenge story but it seemed a bit more involved backstory so back in college a few years ago my coworker lived in an apartment complex the lady at the front desk was apparently a real piece of work not friendly never cutting anyone any slack extremely unhelpful and unwilling to be polite mind you she was the face of the apartment complex its kinda in the job description to be polite even when youre fucking someone over and she was the only one who worked there lets call her rachel the apartment would tape a envelope for the rent check and a newsletter to the apartment door every month according to my coworker the newsletter never had any actual pertinent information in it recipes resident meetups upcoming holidays etc waste of paper literally never anything important so he would just throw it out without reading it there were three big things that pissed him off while living there but he assures me there were many more smaller things that werent really worth telling me first strike his girlfriend would visit him quite often and there was a free parking garage on the property she would always park there one day she came outside and her car had been towed after visiting the front office they learned that the apartment had included in the newsletter for the month that they had started using parking passes and that you had to come to the office to pick one up when he asked why they didnt tape it to the door inside the rent envelopes for the month rachel looked at him like he was crazy she did not offer to help with the towing cost and he tried asking nope bucks update he says that in all past cases when it was actually an important update they would post an independent flier with large font on everyones door except for the parking pass case for some reason second strike after ten months of paying rent on time he was one day late late charge yes it was his fault but a lot of places will let it go if youve been good in the past when he went in to ask for some leniency she shut him down real quick third strike over new years the hot water in the entire complex was out for nine days when he went to the front office to ask for an updateask if they were offering any sort of rebate for the inconvenience rachel said not only no but hell no so at this point apparently he was fed up he took one of the newsletters scanned it in to his computer to get the logo and the headerfooter and wrote a letter to all of the residents saying they were offering a rebate at the front office for the hot water being out for so long making sure to emulate the voice and professionalism of the complexs writing and to be at the office the next day between am and am to pick up a check printed out copies recruited a friend and went out at am with hoodies on they quickly posted them on all of the doors im sure rachels life was hell the next day turning down confused and angry residents in a flurry for two hours she even posted a facebook update on the apartment complexs wall saying that she had the police investigating the fraud and dusting for fingerprints this is a fairly large college town they have better things to be doing i dont think i need to tell you this but he was never caught ps he said that right as he was about to move out rachel got fired and two polite and friendly girls manned the front office from then on tldr coworker has many bad interactions with apartment receptionist then complicates her life by writing and posting a fake apartment announcement saying all residents were getting a rebate
to give you some background im years old ive been taking care of my family my whole life while they really never gave anything back in return especially the last years when i turned years old my grandparents and my dad passed away all the expectations were put on me to go get a job take care of my grandparents then their place once they passed away until we could sell it and basically handle all the stresses and responsibilities while my mom coddled my younger brother now and they sat around watching tv all day cause they couldnt handle it even up until recently whenever they needed money for something or a bill or whatever id be the one to go get a job a second job sell some of my shit while they did nothing except say ohthanks anyways fast forward to today im still living at home taking care of my mom and brother my mom finally got a part time job only because she pissed away all her inheritance money and has been working for awhile about a month ago my brother gets a job yay good for him he tells me hes planning to move out with his girlfriend in about months cause he wants to get out on his own i have no problem with that so long as we all have plan the bills being split ways is fine but if one of us leaves its gonna mess everything up for the other two people unless we have something set up a week later he moves out then he denies ever saying any of that gets pissed at me because even though im happy for him it sucks cause hes kind of fucking things up for us he calls me an asshole tells me to fuck off and cuts me out of his life since i dont do shit even though ive been taking care of both their asses the last years while he sits in his room all day eating taquitos and playing maplestory he also takes his moms car because for some dumb reason she put the car in his name paid it off and is keeping him on her insurance even though she doesnt have a car and has to walk to work now she doesnt even get mad or try to talk to him she lets him do whatever cause apparently hes the good kid or whatever so now were in a bit of a crisis because weve got to figure out to cover his rd of everything at this point i should also mention our bills are way higher than they should be because during one of the times i was living on my own my mom apparently forgot to pay some of her bills for like months which i should also mention during the times i lived on my own i was always paid for my costs plus gave her money to help with her own bills and then she would still try to mooch extra money out of me by bullshitting me about some bill or whatever and then giving that money to my brother or buying cigarettes anyways back to the present im now scrambling for a second job i stay up about days straight with barely hours of sleep per night applying for jobs onlinein person going to interviews etc etc whats my mom doing watching tv and smoking ecigs i get on her ass to do something and she gives me the same answer shes given me the last years shell sell something or borrow money from a neighbor which never happens at this point i should also mention shes kind of a hoarder and has all my grandparents and my dads shit in the garage and backyard apparently she cant sell the stuff yet which shes been saying since because she needs a digital camera even though both my girlfriend and i have explained to her hundreds of times that we have cameras on our phones theres ebay apps it takes two fucking seconds but regardless most of that stuff is shit anyways save for a few personal items and some jewelry and she should just get off her ass and get another damn job so im driving to work last night and im fuming but im looking at everything objectively realistically were behind on rent which again my mom doesnt care about oh our landlords nice she doesnt mind oh there was problems with this place before we moved in so its okay if were little short our rent is due on the st we got an extension to the th then the th then the th my moms planning to pay this month on the th every month ive always had my share plus more covered its always on her or my brothers end that the money isnt there so im looking at this and im like theres no fucking way i can do this even if i get this month what about next month and the month after that i mean yeah i already work days a week i could get a rd th th job but then i wouldnt have time to go emt school id be making just enough to cover everything but i wouldnt have any extra money to get myself out and into something better and its at this point i say fuck it im not paying a single penny more ive got several offers from friends to move in with them for rd of what im paying now no cost for utilities or anything else im good to go im taking my money and gtfo but im not a complete asshole not just yet anyways this is still going to benefit my mom as well because if shes not paying anything either she can save up her money shes probably got days to gtfo and even then she could milk that by squatting or whatever thats thousands of dollars to get another place get a cheap car whatever get her shit together shes never really had to figure things out on her own because me or someone else would always fix everything heres where my revenge comes in im not on the lease years ago when i was living on my own my mom wanted me to cosign on a lease with her and she swore up and down that it wouldnt affect anything and that shed handle everything but i didnt buy it my brother however did so im not liable for anything im leaving and they can have fun dealing with clearing out all of moms shit oh and theyre also required to have a professional cleaner come in and clean before they leave as well which could be a bit costly considering my mom has a few cats that she lets do whatever they want and doesnt care they piss on something or tear on the carpet and oh well the fence was kind of messed up when we got here i dont think the landlord will care there are wear and tear laws too so i dont think she expects it to be immaculate or anything and id offer to help buy getting a uhaul truck to get all their shit out or help pay for a professional cleaning but im not on the lease oh and my brother just told me to fuck off and cut me out of his life a week ago while my mom just sits around not doing anything to fix the situation like she always does so now they can both fuck off and deal with it tldr lazy mom and coddled younger brother treat me like shit and only need me when they need money brother moves out tells to me fo and mom puts all the shit on me i have enough and leave and their left to deal with everything since their name is on the lease and not me 
long story short my asshole sister ruined the halfblood prince installment in the harry potter series at the time she was obsessed with twilight and was reaching the end of the last book she was i was and i was house sitting until she got home roughly an hour from when i devise my plan heres the plan which i started she kept the last twilight book in her room on her shelf i ripped out all of the necessary pages to read the big finish i then disconnected out internet from our router she couldnt figure out the power button on my xbox i had nothing to worry about she gets home leaves her purse in the kitchen and goes to her room she forgets her cellphone in her purse i take it and hide it to be given back anonymously later that way she cant call anyone for an extra book she cant drive she got home on her school bus no permit best part of all she cant leave the house without my parents permission which she cant get because i have hidden her and all the other phones in the house no safety hazard i knew where they were and were easily accessible if you knew where they were now comes the fun part shes mad because she finished all of the rest of the book and finds her last necessary pages ripped out shes searching the house first for her pages then her cellphoneany phone and cant find either shes trapped in our house without her final pages or any way to get a borrowed copy our parents finally get home from their jobs and as they are opening the garage door i run past my sisters room and yell in her door the spoiler ending to the last twilight book which she never read she immediately goes to our parents and tells them everything i supposedly did giving me time to cleanly and unnoticeably tape the pages back together put her cellphone in her purse she is standing at their car telling them everything keeping them in their car replace the home phones and get in my room to act like ive been staring at my video games ever since i got home 
there is this manager paul who is very impatient when it comes to me helping him he isnt helpful when it comes to asking him questions about his problem he wants me to just do my job and fix it without any input from him one day he called me to come over and fix something for someone else when he hung up it didnt hang up right and the line was still open i listened and the other guy was saying it wasnt a big enough deal for me to have to come over but paul insisted saying he likes making me work for my pay because i dont do anything after that id keep hearing from my coworker terry stuff like dude paul really doesnt like you paul started only dealing with terry and generally complaining about me to others so after figuring out how and doing lots of testing on my computer i remotely connected to his computer and set the screen saver to turn on after minute of inactivity i also set it to lock the computer when he would move the mouse and make the screen saver turn off so hed have to put in his username and password each time to unlock it nothing special there except i set the permissions on that area of his registry to deny his account access to change the settings in fact i set it to deny his account the ability to view certain parts of the settings his account could view it enough to follow the settings there and turn on the screen saver after minute but enough was denied so when he went to his screen saver settings it showed that no screen saver was set being an inexperienced computer user he rebooted several times trying to fix it as i expected and hoped he only called terry and did so many times throughout the week even better terry was busy and started getting annoyed at him as well and would take a while to get around to him i would remotely connect to his screen and watch the screen saver come on and he would move the mouse and unlock it several times in a short period of time he started moving the mouse all the time he got very very upset he even called our boss and complained when our boss asked me about it i said this was the first time anyone had mentioned it to me but that i knew that paul had called terry several times over the week and thought he was dealing with whatever it was i offered to go fix it but he said hed get with terry since he was the one working on it terry would complain to me about pauls issue and say he couldnt figure it out he wanted me to look into it but didnt stress it much i pushed it back on him saying that paul obviously likes him and that he needs to call me if he wants me to fix it i offered several suggestions that seemed like really good ideas to fix it knowing full well that they wouldnt after a second week of him calling terry he then called me and i let him explain the problem to me i asked a bunch of questions and had him try a bunch of things as he got more frustrated because he had already tried these things he complained that terry only came by a couple times and didnt get it fixed so i went right over there and fixed it quickly and gave some bogus procedure that terry had suggested once and didnt get around to trying yet i then told terry that i fixed it and that his solution was what did it i also relayed that information to our boss and got a pat on the back for going out of my way and taking on an issue that terry was working on since he was busy with other things paul treated me a lot better afterward and i got some good laughs to myself for weeks straight
lets set out the players me david im tony brother tony owns a medical it company lets call them it docs well it docs was just starting quite a few years ago when it secured what was to be one of its biggest contracts ever it was a major milestone for tony and it docs however tony needed some assistance to properly execute on the contract tony approached another company called making this up bsob it ran by a mr liar tony and mr liar had several meetings in which tony outlined the contract and his plan of action and where hed need mr liar assistance mr liar listened and verbally committed that bsob it could help and would be more then happy to help but needed more information tony gave mr liar the information and thought everything was just fine when one day the doctors office called up my brother tony and said theyd no longer be interested in the contract and had just signed a deal with bsob it tony was pissed he came to me for advice im not sure if this was good advice but the way i saw it is he was just a light weight in the game and got shafted by a heavy weight if he went after bsob it and mr liar today it could massively backfire i told tony he needs to toss this way in the bin and focus on growth not revenge he then said to me youre right but one day ill get them tony went on to grow it docs into a thriving company when one day he had become so large he decided the most economical way to grow to acquire his competitionand he set his eyes on bsob it in that time bsob it had lost several key contracts and was quite a bit smaller then it was since the days of the meetings between mr liar and my brother tony however my brother decided to acquire this company i suspect a lot of it had to do with the righting the injustice of yesterday tomorrow type deal now tony was very smart in his approach he put one of his most senior partners to be the face of the acquisition he even went so far as to accidentally remove his picture from the ceofounder portion of his companies website he figured that no way would mr liar remember it docs and wouldnt suspect a thing well he successfully bought out bsob it and mr liar was still their ceo however there is no need for two ceosnow is there tony invited mr liar to discuss the role that he will play with it docs i guess mr liar assumed that hed retain his position and benefits but there was no need for two ceos so as my brother said mr liar and him went over how the company would be structured and then tony asked mr liar where do you see yourself in this organization now those meetings lasted for awhile over the course of several days what struck tony is mr liar never remembered their first encounters and how mr liar stole his client until then in the final meeting something clicked and mr liar said to my brother didnt we do business together before my brother smirked and said yeswe have mr liar said i cant seem to recall do you my brother smiled back and said do you remember when in year xxxx a small start up medical it company came to your company for assistance with a mr x doctors office mr liar is getting uncomfortable in his chair he said yea my brother went onto say well we never did much business together because after we discussed being partners that doctors office called me up and said they were no longer doing business with me and have chosen your company over mine even though you didnt even see the opportunity until i asked for your company partnership on the deal mr liar was stillpretty sure he already knew what was up my brother then said now mr liar my partners and senior mgt have discussed what role and what skillset you bring to the table we simply do not see the need for your continued service in our organization and will be ending your employment with us with that mr liar left the company for good and before people bash my brother mr liar really didnt bring anything to the table besides being a business man with questionable ethics and with extremely outdated it skills

oh man ive been sitting on this story for five years and i havent told a soul i was living in an efficiency apartment by myself for the first time i was approximately years old and i was working two server job both of which required a clean and presentable uniform every three days or so i would have to do a load of work clothes and i didnt have much time to do it between jobs the apartment complex that i lived in had apartments in it and we all shared a washer and dryer i had the cycle timed to the minute and i would go to my apartment to watch a tv show or clean or something and would change my clothes from the washer to the dryer without wasting any time i was considerate after i had been living there for three months or so this lady moves in and starts doing her laundry in the washer and dryer but she had the habit of leaving it in for hours sometimes all night i would go to do my laundry see that her clothes were in the washer go back to my apartment and wait for about minutes or so go back and they would still be there i would set an alarm for balls early in the morning to do my laundry before work and her clothes would still be in there after this happened three times or so and my uniforms were pretty dirty i would take her clothes out of the washer and set them on top of the dryer so that i could wash my clothes i did this a few times then she wrote a note that said something along the lines of if you touch my clothes again i will call the police or something whatever i wrote a note back saying that she isnt the only one that has to use the laundry she seemed to get the message for a little bit maybe i just wasnt doing my laundry at the same time as her but one night i was doing laundry at midnight after i had gotten off of work and my clothes were in the dryer i set an alarm that would go off in minutes which is about how long the dryer in the complex takes before the alarm goes off she shows up at my door with my uniform shirts neatly folded and a shit eating grin on her face and says you left these over there i figured i would fold them and bring them to you the shirts werent even dry she pulled them out before they were done i was really wanting to get my laundry done fast so i could go to bed i just said thanks and slammed the door in her face the next time i went to do my laundry of course hers was in there i did my normal thing of going back to my apartment and waiting for minutes or so then going back over there to check if she had moved her clothes to be fair i did this for three hours after three hours i took a gallon of bleach and poured it all over her clothes in the washer i dont know what got into me i was just feeling some rage from her writing a nasty note and taking my clothes out of the dryer folding them and giving them to me while they were wet the next morning as i was leaving for work i saw her pulling her bleach stained clothes out of the dryer for some reason she didnt suspect me because she was fighting with her next door neighbor as well go figure she moved out soon after tldr lady gets mad at me for doing my laundry i poured bleach on her trashy clothes
i work in san francisco and take the bart train into the city everyday the trains like any big city get very full during peak hours nothing makes me more angry than when someone thinks they are too good for the line they think it is acceptable to just cut infront of everyone and get on the train in the past when i have been cut off i have tried to fart or burp on them this comes with the downside of making the entire car smell for just one person not fair if you ask me but today luck was on my side this something girl cut right in front of me she got a seat and seemed very smug about her current situation that was until her stop came she did not foresee an irate man with a large backpack standing between her and her exit difficult to stand up with fat man and a backpack in your way muhaha she did not make her exit at the time transfer station that should give her about minutes to think about the social etiquette of lines 
i work for a corporation we had three companies company a think low end company b medium end company c high end all in the same industry just at different quality standardsprice points each company was different and each company had similar names but where divided now if you worked for company b like i did you couldnt sell company a or c products and the same for everyone else pretty much if you worked for the company you knew this but our consumers didnt which was good cause it didnt confuse customers then one day a bright eye ceo who should of never been a ceo decided he wanted all the company under one name at first we thought this was a great idea this obviously meant we could all sell each other products and offer more choices to our consumers right wellno the sales people in a b c and could only sell their respective productseven though all three of them worked for the new company called company d this pissed a lot of people off ceo said fuck it and went through with it so i created numerous fake emails and profiles and began inquiring on different products with sales people i knew couldnt sell that product i would then escalate this compliant up to their supervisors supervisor supervisor until i would finally get to the ceo at which point i would proceed to inquire againwhy in the world would he do this keep in mind i had inside knowledge on our structure so climbing the ranks was easier i then cited false advertising and various other laws and told the ceo unless i could work with that particular sales person same from company b on company a product i would sue i did this across maybe accounts keeping each one fresh i was a busy man and then i pulled out my ace card during this time i had become good drinking buddies with a consumer law lawyer luck of the draw and he wrote up a draft and sent it to my ceo outlying the potential law suit the policy changed we are still under company d but i now have the rights to sell any product to any consumer under our roof know what the hardest part of this whole ordeal was i was in a meeting with the ceo and he posted or complaints and the lawyer letter and discussed it and explained his reasons for the change in policy i had the biggest shit eating grin on my face cause every single one of the emails we discussed was in fact me after the meeting i asked the ceo so did any of those consumers convert to sales he goes strangely enough no i shook my head and said thats a real shame its been quite some time since this change occurred no one besides my wife who helped me even knows what i did not only that our company is stronger then ever turns out re branding was really smart because we consolidated our marketing resources cleared up customer confusion our sales people can make more money and our consumers have a greater range of selection

i was told to post this to rprorevenge in the belief that you guys would enjoy it if it doesnt fit my apologies and you can remove it posthaste i just remembered this one while drawing in my sketchbook today apologies for the length when i was in middleschool i believe th grade because that was a shit year all around i was constantly bullied by a kid named d d was just an all around dick he thought he was hot shit because he was athletic and girls thought he was good looking he had the snarkiest voicelike dash from the incredibles except not cool and he had the most punchable faceeven though this was years ago thinking of it makes my blood boil d had it out for me maybe because i was smarter than him maybe because i was infinitely more handsome than him or maybe it was because i was a nerdy kid that looked like the type who should get bullied i dont know but he was always on my case he would knock my stuff out of my hands in the halls whisper about me behind my back and constantly make attempts to fight me in order to get me in trouble two events forced my hand the first was when he pushed me into my locker while i was bent over picking up my stuff my glasses snapped i am someone whos prone to avoiding violence as much as he can but when put into a sudden shocking situation i can get upset quickly that was the case here i turned around and went in swinging with every bit of emotional force i could muster i only got him once in the gut before my math teacher pulled us apart i think she knew what was up because she left me off with a warning d denied doing anything and was believed and i still had to replace my glasses spending money that my family couldnt afford to spend i was aware of this and devastated then came the final straw d made fun of my weight in front of everyone in my art class including the girl i had a crush on that was it it was like a gunshot went through me like a needle snapping from being pushed down too hard for too long i felt like an entirely different person i slowly closed my sketchbook looked straight into ds eyes with a blank almost serial killer stare and simply said youre going to get it d gave me a weird stare but thought nothing else of it months passed d slightly kept his distance from me only bothering me now and then probably out of fear i would do something terrible to him this was my plan i waited it out and heres why in said art class we have a sketchbook this sketchbook is comprised of all the work that goes into producing our final projects when were done with our sketchbooks we are meant to put them into cubbies in a cabinet the sketchbooks are turned in at the end of the trimester for a final grade i realized waiting outside my drama class which was one room down from the art class that the janitor came to clean out the art class trashcan about five minutes after we we left the classroom perfect i had to time it just right its two days before our sketchbook is due we all put our sketchbooks into our cubbies and leave the classroom my art teacher starts to walk down the hall after locking the art room i chase her down before she turns the corner mrs art i say i forgot to put one last thing into my sketchbook do you mind if i can get your keys and fix it really quick ill turn it in to you right after im done itll only take a few minutes after contemplating this mrs a decided to give me the key she had no reason to believe anything sinister i had been on my best behavior all trimester just for this moment i had only minutes i rushed into the art room then i ripped open ds cubbie pulled out his sketchbook and stuffed into the trashcan i threw in just enough scratch paper over the book to make it not look suspicious then i dipped out as i left the hallway i checked back to see that the janitor had arrived right on time i grinned going to mrs as office thanks rockblocked she says no thank you and can i say this was probably the best art class ive ever had i replied beaming to keep a long story from going any longer d failed the class and had to go to summer school i knew this by watching the chaos from affair eavesdropping on his conversations he was moved out of my middleschool the next year tldr kid bullied me and called me fat in front of my crush i executed the perfect stealth operation and ruined his artgrade making him go to summer school and potentially moving him out of my middleschool as well
maybe you can draw a clue from my username but i worked as an assistant manager for a retail store that sells clothing for plussized women for the most part i did my job well and the customers loved me i was a poor performer when it came to getting customers to apply for our store card however the store was not in a great neighborhood and it was a recession i didnt push the card and my evaluations always reflected that i was a poor performer the regional manager always made it known that he didnt like me because of this problem i had with getting people to apply our store was also under scrutiny for having high loss shoplifting the store manager and the other assistant store manager were bffs they always made their quota for credit card applications i later found out they had a pool of social security numbers and names that they constantly reran applications with they were cheating the system and basically making me look like crap in the process just before july th i got a text message from the store manager asking if i had put a blouse in the back to save for a later purchase she sent a pic of the top i told her no it wasnt mine the store manager then had pics up of her at a th of july bbq wearing the top on facebook the store manager was always super broke she didnt have a car she had too many kids she lived on state assistance when i got to work i decided to see if the transactions showed that she bought the top she didnt i was furious the company always sent loss specialists to our store to ask us if we were stealing and i hated those interviews i emailed the head loss guy for the company and gave him screen shots of everything the text messages the facebook pics the inventory screens she was fired i also exposed the social security number scam they were running to meet their quotas but it turns out they knew about it and were deciding what to do in the end i was made very uncomfortable and i quit it turns out the regional manager was made to look really dumb and he already didnt like me
first roommate was a girl i met during community college she was so cool totally chill and funny moved in with her and everything changed she would start screaming at me because i turned the ac onin august during degree f dayseven though i promised to compensate fully for it and it turned out to just cost she would also get angry when i woke her cat up she got so crazy hostile i would lock my door at night out of fear of her stabbing me in my sleep so i moved out after that month but i was still obligated to the lease i tried to find her a new roommate that she liked but she made the process difficult i was getting anxious because rent was about to be due and i was not about to pay for two apartments so i stopped giving a fuck and signed a sublease with a random foreign yearold man i made sure he was fully aware of what he was getting into when i told her she started yelling how im stupid i dont know anything about the law and she knows a lot more about leasing agreements since she worked at a leasing office the look of quiet ragefrustration when i laid out everything stated in our leasing agreement and rental laws in our statewas too satisfying addon a year later i was at an intersection just about to take a right turn she was coming the opposite way and sped up real fast to take a left in a dangerous attempt to cut me off i saw this and stopped my mom who never met my exroommate was in the passenger seat and turned to me in utter disbelief wondering what just happened certified crazy sort of satisfying knowing that our battles conclusion still got this crazy persons feathers ruffled second story for my senior year i lucked out with rooming with two very good friends of mine this was only because their third roommate squeals had an internship opportunity for that semester so i would have to find someplace else for the spring which was fine i call her squeals because she doesnt talk she squeals in a really soft voice so you cant understand a damn thing shes saying roommates confirmed she adopted this voice to appear cute to guys incoherent as fuck but somehow she gets a lot of guys anyway i was seriously hoping that she wouldnt be back for spring so i could room with these two awesome girls so i was really excited when squeals was telling everyone she wasnt coming back for spring then rather last minuteshe was coming back so i had to get an apartment fast i put a hefty deposit on one then shes not coming backand begs me to take her place i do so because the roommates price and location are awesomebut i still lose that deposit and i mention it to her she didnt even say sorry or even acknowledge the suckiness of it which was what i know i would do if i were in her shoes she changed her mind three freaking times without thinking about anything i was outraged and so were my roommates so we started plotting together i never had any kind of written lease agreement with this girl which i knew i could use to my advantage at the end i convinced her i was going to take over for the summer even though i was leaving three months beforehand i told her the day i was moving out and that left squeals responsible for three months rent tldr two different girls got into rental agreements with me i made the first one live with a much older stranger the second one had to pay for nobody to live in her room edit i get that this isnt as extreme or interesting as one would hope for this subreddit but it wasnt small enough to go on pettyrevenge edit i didnt know there would be a couple revengebased subreddits this is because i honestly thought people would be too ashamed to talk about it since im ashamed of my own scheming sheltered much up until now i thought pettyrevenge was as hardcore as it got love all this though makes my brain jizz 
the stage is the local bigbox retailer parking lot id parked my ford explorer on the side of the store between two minivans and as such my visibility for backing out of my space was impaired i ease out slowly only to hear a furious horn and a red dodge neon fly by coming from the backside of the store damn lady excuuuuse me i finish my backing procedure and see her waiting at the end of the row about even with the front of the store shes right in the middle and i have enough room to get around her on the right and turn right to exit the lot i do so and as im pulling away i see her in my rearview mirror gassing it hard coming after me oh so you want to discuss this further do you i hit the brakes kinda hard and you can guess the predictable outcome keep in mind this is a truck i tow a small camper its got a class iii receiver hitch these do not give at all i hop out and see that she has impaled the nose of her pretty little red car on my hitch there is coolant there is transmission fluid there are words many of them foul from both her and her passenger boyfriend i smile as the language pours forth until she gets to the part where she exclaims that her father is on the police force and im going to be sorry at that point i inform her that in the case of a rearend collision the rearmost vehicle is almost always cited for failure to maintain a safe following distance and her father should be able to explain that to her police are called and some random patrolman shows up statements are taken but no citations are issued as its private property i see her and her friend pull away trailing fluids and as a last measure of justice i see her car doesnt even have a permanent tag yet just a paper dealership plate i pop back into the store to buy a new trailer plug connector 
lemme start by saying that i went to a mexican high school one of the bad ones it was a technical school so i chose a course about computers the place was such a mess it was either that or a foodrelated course so it wasnt much of a choice anyway my class was divided by nerds and idiots but like jocky buffed idiot bullies it was a pretty tense class especially since i was very much a nerd on the bus ride home one day i had an argument with my girlfriend so we ended up not talking to each other i noticed one guy from our class was staring at us he was one of the more annoying bullies and most of my friends had already had to trade blows with him before so i just glared at him and forgot about him i soon got to my stop and left the bus without saying goodbye to my girlfriend later my girlfriend sends me an im telling me that she doesnt want me to get angry or get in trouble i ask her what happened she hesitantly tells me the guy sat with her the moment i left asked her if she wouldnt rather have him as her man and since she was too scared and shy to tell him anything else than to go away she began groping her leg for a while until the bus reached her stop and she left im pretty pissed at this point the next day i see the guy at school but i dont say a word to him fights were pretty common at that place but i at least wanted to do it outside after school so all i can do is glare at him all day and wait i almost made it five minutes left to leave school and he apparently snaps he couldnt take me staring daggers at him all day long and got up right to my face talked trash and shoved me now i know that a shove in that context means either a fight or pussying out and i wasnt going to pussy out i might be a nerd but im pretty tall and thick so his shove doesnt even budge me and i punch him right in the face i aimed for his nose but he managed to crouch at the last second i still hit him right on the forehead and he lands right on his ass im about to kick him in the face but one of my friends stops me shes begging me to stop and i realize the teachers still in the classroom i take my stuff and leave with my girlfriend pretty much the entire class congratulates me somebody even told me i did something everybody had wanted to do since for a while now i hear the asshole behind me shouting that my girlfriend is a liar i turn around just in time to see my teacher drag him by the arm to the principals office the little dick tries to explain that i punched him for no reason and my teacher tells him to shut up and that shes fed up with him a couple of weeks later he drops out of school some months later i read in the newspaper that he and his buddies were arrested for driving under the influence carrying loaded weapons and trying to bribe the cops that arrested them turns out they were trying to threaten a wealthy ranch owner or something good riddance i say this was a couple of years back presently i still occasionally see him in the street i look directly at him every time not once has he been able to look back sorry for this being a bit long dreams do come true i suppose is the lesson learnt by this
edit i speak french so excuse my poor english scroll down to where the fun starts to skip the preschool fight i had this really close friend lets call her bsb backstabbing bitch who was talking so much shit behind my back without me ever knowing i always had doubts that something was fishy but i was not able to prove it one day a random guy who was a closer friend to me sent me all the text bsb sent him she was saying stuff like i was just a trash not good enough to be friend with her she was and that i was fired bsb said all these things without ever telling me that there was a problem between us so i had no idea what was going on i confronted bsb by showing her the messages maybe i was a fool but i was expecting explanations or apologies it got bad instead of taking the blame bsb said my life was over because there was rumours that a guy leaked nudes of me all this was my fault and i should move out of town dye my hair because i was just a whore here i replied saying i would have told her and defended her if something like that happened to her i ended the friendship there they have a family business and i used to help them with some work they couldnt do themselves i was pretty much the only person in the area to do my job so they were not in a good situation her mother called me a few times saying she needed some help but i was not changing my mind it was a no for me i waited for a year i waited for apologies but they never came out of the blue bsb sent me a facebook link about soap makingcauz i like soaps like nothing happened between us maybe it was to remember herself that she never did anything wrong i lost my shit there this is where the fun starts revenge is a best dish served cold i used to help them with their family business for the past years i knew details of how the business worked and i knew pretty much everything on how they hid money from the irs i called the irs and told them everything i told them how they hid the money and where they could get all the proof of their real sales their real sale is around a month and they probably declare half of that when someone was paying them cash they would duplicate the invoice giving two invoices with the same number to different clients the catch is each item they sold had to be inspected by a professional that professional also had to add a piece to the item before it was sent to the client the irs only has to ask for the invoices at that professional and they have all the proof of bsbs real sale they were also shipping every item under their care and the buyer had to pay a fee cash to the shipper there is even the details of it on their website what a bunch of idiots
so i was about yrs old at the time i was in the raf cadets through school and lucky enough to get on the glider training course this basically involves being on an raf base for a week while being taught how to fly a glider awesome there were about of us on the course and one older lad probably he was a warrant officer but not a real one just in the cadets like us however the actual officers had put him in charge and he was on a more advanced course than us this made him think he was the man none of us knew each other beforehand but the of us quickly became friends and the dickhead was an outsider from day it didnt seem to bother him as he fucking hated us and didnt want to talk to us anyway fair enough however he started trying to impose all sorts of rules on usfor example we had to attend breakfast in uniform well that was bullshit because we didnt wear uniform during the day just a tshirt under the flying suit and wearing uniform meant we had to march around the base rather than walk and salute peoplefuck off he also tried to impose curfews and other dumb rules initially we just told him we werent going to do anything he said but the snitch told the actual officers and then we had to well nobody likes snitches so heres what we did while he was out we took some wood from the forest and chiselled it into wedges we then hammered it into place such that the window in his room could not be opened at all from inside when he came back we very quietly tied some rope to his door handle and then to another door handle so that he couldnt open his door from inside his room we then got a sheet of paper and lit it on fire to create a load of smoke and then put it out we didnt want an actual fire then we hit the smoke alarm the dickhead literally shat himself when he realised he was trapped in his room and heard the rest of us shouting get out etc he started shouting at first and then it turned to screaming he was pounding and pounding on the door eventually we let him out we had to because we had to call the front gate security and tell them it was a false alarm and make sure everything was ok if they came to check it out anyway this fat fuck had tears streaming down his face and just ran off saying he was going to get us fucked up it was great because there were no repercussions for us and he never spoke to any of us and therefore never tried to bully us again moral of the story dont be a fat cunt 
i work for a privately owned fairly large sales company with million a year in sales our business model relies on a talented sales force to bring in the revenue our founder very early on in his days brought on a young man who went on to become our ceo for over years this ceo was responsible for our massive growth and mergers with other players in the same field he made this company great and his motto was this the sales force always comes first he understood that in this business environment that was very competitive the only way to succeed was with a properly well trained sales force because of him we have the best compensation package in the industry in old age struck him down and in he passed away surrounded by family and loyal long term coworkers at first the company decided they would simply use the vps to run the company kind of like a democracy around them they let things go and we did alright however in we experienced some extreme hardship due largely to the economy in it was decided to bring in a ceo to lead the road to recovery when the new ceo came in he decided the best course of action was cost cutting and layoffs he also decided that the sales force had too many products and cut the sales force in two team one side of the sales force sold product a the other side sold product b although both options are from the same industry they provide different benefits and disadvantages and depending on your customer product a might be better or product b might be better this created a lot of tension among the sales team never the less he was the ceo and could do as he please at least he left our compensation package alone just to qualify how frustrating this is imagine you have customer a come in and youre on team b however customer a is youre customer and he wants product a you have to hand over that customer to team a and lose the deal before you could just sell him product a and be happy well it came to our yearly meeting where we celebrate our success and discuss how next year can be better their was a really dirty rumor going around that the commission agreement was going to be cut significantly this didnt sit well among the sales force so the top of the sales force gathered together by the way the top produced approximately of the sales we held the majority of the company revenue and profits in our hands we all agreed prior to the meeting when the new plan was to be unveiled if it would result in a significant cut of more then wed walk out of the room this is a company of people of which are the sales force the commission plan was unveiled with the new ceo at the top of the stage explaining how this was necessary to protect the company future a pay cutwhat the hell was this man thinking his justification its still above industry average well our costs are below industry average cause we have an excellent sales team who reduces your costs therefore pay us never the less a heated exchangedebate went on when finally with the ceo not budging when one of the best sales person stood up and said to the ceo that a large majority of the sales staff had heard we might be getting a pay cut and had agreed that if we did wed walk out the door to which the ceo responded then you will be terminated for insubordination and replaced btw the guy who he said this to produced million dollar in revenue the year before all of us at the same time got up and walked out of that conference room in total the of us who walked out of that conference room were responsible for million dollars of the company revenue the vps were very worried if you think was bad imagine losing a huge chunk of your most talented sales people very quickly the sales vp pulled me aside and asked me what was going on i explained to him that we hated what this ceo has done to this company and we want him out the vp also asked other sales people and the opinion among the staff was the same we were told to take a break and theyd figure something out hours later myself and others were called into a meeting to represent the sale staff it was myself and others along with the vp of marketing sales accounting product mgt a lawyer or two and the family was on the phone we had a an agreement signed by the a large chunk of the sales staff that demanded one of two outcomes pay increase or ceo resign and the products no longer be divided with the same commission agreement as before however it not be cut needless to say the ceo was unhappy with the agreement and decided to stand firm it was obvious to everyone that ceo was the only one that was going stand firm i guess his ego was blinding him after we refused to budge on our demands to be fair the vp team wasnt that inclined to argue with us we were asked to leave the next morning we were all called into the conference room the vp of sales got up on the stage and basically said as you can see mr dickhead isnt here anymorehe decided to pursue a different career path and resign we have since decided to make some changes to our business our products again will be all under one team and the commission agreement will be unchanged since then weve vowed to not have a ceo our founders son acts as a silent ceo so just because your the ceo and your the boss doesnt mean you can do anything you like by the way since weve grown significantly even in this challenging environment 
xpost from petty revenge i worked for a small company that manufactured and sold things found in small retail stores i was the customer service manager and had a few sales reps that worked for me basically we would call stores who carried our products and check to see if they needed to order anything also we would call stores who didnt carry our products tell them about our products send them samples and then get them to order from us i had a small staff of sales representatives this was not an easy job but it paid well now i was good friends with the owner of the company he was never there and i ran things for him i was introduced to him by a former colleague named john john used to run a small investment group at the same office he would take investment sales calls and then get a group of people with money to invest so john was no longer there but he would get sales calls on our main phone line people trying to sell investment opportunities in oil amp gas or some technology start up all sorts of crazy stuff and the salesmen were top notch professional sales guys in other words aggressive so i would have the calls transferred to me then i would explain that john wasnt here anymore and they would stop calling us jessica was one of our better reps she was an aggressive but well mannered woman in fact she was a bit of a firecracker but in a good way so one day jessica gets a call from a deep voiced man asking is john in she says he isnt there and is about to ask him to hold for one second so she can transfer the call to me but the guy hangs up on her mid sentence she bitches to me in a no big deal kind of way but basically says can you believe the nerve of some people we move on with our day the next day she answers the main line and a deep voiced man asks is john in she says no and he hangs up on her before she can utter another word she tells me in a slightly disturbed manner i tell her if he calls again to tell him that john doesnt work here anymore the next day she gets another call from the deep voiced man he asks is john in and she says no he doesnt work here anymore but he hung up as soon as he heard the word no i dont know if you have any experience with sales but you need to have a good attitude i need jessica to be in good spirits hanging up on someone is one of the rudest things you can do on the planet jessica is fuming this is really getting to her so i think some revenge is necessary i tell jessica that when this guy calls tomorrow and asks if john is in to tell him yes please hold on for one second while i transfer you sure enough the guy calls the next day and jessica transfers him to me i put him on speaker phone and tell jessica to come sit in my office in order to listen to the call i close the door i know how to talk the talk when it comes to investments i ask him his first and last name his first name was david then the company he works for and then i say our phone lines are having problems i asked him what is your direct phone number in case we get cut off so i listen to his sales pitch about investing in real estate development i ask him some good questions signs that i am going to invest like what kind of roi can i expect and is there a limit on how much one person can invest at this point the guy thinks i am the whale that is going to put his kids through college i then begin to share my story what we do here that we are in the business of selling also that i have sales representatives that work for me then i switch my tone completely i was raised by a former marine and i know how to chew someone out so i go all r lee on his ass i shout are you thick in the head david says in a stunned and offended voice excuse me i continue are you slow or something david no me then why have you been calling here everyday and hanging up on my employees while they are mid sentence jessica looks at me like i just gave her every xmas present she ever wanted david i havent been doing that i think there is some kind of misunderstanding listen david you have been set up we dont get many incoming phone calls everyday for the last days you have been calling us at about the same time you have a very distinct voice we have been waiting for you to call today there is no doubt that you have been calling my office and hanging up on the person as soon as they say the word no your calls have been upsetting my peaceful office and we decided to take your sales call today david uhh long pause i didnt mean anything by it who is running the business over there david says in a meek voice i am am i supposed to believe you are the owner of the company david no who do you report to david finally gives me his bosss name and phone number he also tells when he comes into the office next and i tell david he should probably confess to his boss before i call him david agrees and apologizes i end the call and jessica says that was the best thing to ever happen needless to say we didnt get any more calls from david i never called his boss either i thought our conversation was punishment enough and i am willing to bet david never hung up on anyone again

story contains some obscenities beware at one point a couple of years ago i worked for a calling center basically thats what it was literally people would receive different letters from different clients of ours and call in to schedule an appointment if they were interested pretty harmless stuff at least i wasnt calling people out of the blue and bugging them so one day a couple of months into the job i received a call i started out with the normal thank you for calling am i speaking with said his name all of the letters sent out obviously had name and address on them so saying their name made it a bit more personal and less robotic he confirmed that yes i was and spent the next seconds calling me every name in the book he told me he was sick of getting the letters that i was a cunt and that i was a slut and a whore and if i lived any closer to your office i would come over and beat your brains in with a fucking baseball bat skank when i could finally get a word in edgewise i told him we would be more than happy to put him on the do not call list and to have a nice day right before i was able to hang up he yelled dont you fucking hang up on me cunt i will find you and kill you okay first of all i was working from home states away from the return address he had received so i wasnt too worried about that it just pissed me off that he made the choice to pick up the phone and call the from a letter that he obviously wasnt interested in he could have just thrown it away so later that day when things slowed down a bit i did a google on his name its a pretty rare name and found out things he has a facebook with friends of them being his mother the other being his brother and loves playing farmville he is a fucking neonazi who makes comments on some pretty extreme websites this includes but is not limited to threats against the dirty whores who live across the street to him he wanted to rape them until they bled so they knew what real pain was threats against minorities annnnnnnnnnnnnd threats against the president now i am not saying this happened but the fbi may or cough not have received an attachment with this guys name phone and address along with copies of his threats to the commander in chief i mean maybe that happened who knows be careful who you are a dick too i guess is the moral of the story or just dont be a dick even better
this happened years ago there was a spike of petty vandalism going on along my road i live in the rural bit of town and after at night its abandoned and easy to flee from which made it an ideal target mostly it was teenagers going down the road and hitting mailboxes with a baseball bat every week my neighbor decided he was sick of it under the guise of reinforcing the post he installed a metal pole between his mailbox and his newspaperbox it was hard to see during the day much less detectable at night while doing down a country road it was also planted well into the ground with a little concrete for good measure he said he saw it happen from his porch one night the car was barreling down the road and mailboxes were flying off whenever it passed them then the car got to his and there was a scream as it kept driving the next day you could see the ruined mailboxes up until his at his there were two halves of a wooden baseball bat he said he actually felt kind of bad for the idiot as he thought they would be cruising down the road and it would just give them a jolt but the kind of people who go down the road smashing mailboxes are not the kind to drive slow with your friend hanging out the window swinging a bat that would require intelligence god knows what it did to that assholes arm

this story is from a female friend i had in college and took place almost years ago now she had an apartment that had a school basketball court right behind it one afternoon she was studying for exams and these dickhead teens in a fancy car showed up parked with the sunroof and doors open and began to shoot some hoops while blasting some shitty music loud enough to rattle her windows she tried to do the right thing at firstshe went out and kindly asked them to turn it down a bit they responded with a long stream of abuse such as fuck you cunt stupid whore etc and laughed about it they did not turn down the music this loud music went on for about another minutes at one point she looked out the window and observed that they had left the car there with the doors open music still blasting but had moved alllll the way across the field which was about the length of a football field so she grabbed a bucket and filled it with an entire gallon bottle of liquid bleach took it outside and poured it all over the interior of the car all over the seats and the floor and the dash they did not even come back to the car for another minutes or so leaving the bleach more time to do its magic she knew they came back when the music stopped and she heard them yelling what the fuck shit and a stream of other such stuff they were super angry and were looking all around they may have suspected her but they had no idea where she came from and they did not see her now she told me they got in an drove away which means they had to sit in it too hopefully ruing their clothes and maybe even burning them i dont know the girl anymorelargely because she was evil and i was afraid of her myself but i always think of that story whenever someone pisses me off with a parked car
my dad used to be an extremely fit guy back in the day ie before he had teenage sons and has gained a lot of weight and with it came diabetes after being in denial for a year he came to terms with it and started eating right again and bringing his lunch to work instead of hitting the grill for a quick burger and fries to and started exercising again to help lose weight after a while he noticed his meals going missing out of the fridge at work and he started asking around to his coworkers and most of then pointed out ralph was eating whatever container my dad described his food being in he approached ralph about it and ralph quickly fessed up and said it wouldnt happen again but he continued anyway after a while my dad got aggravated not because he would have to find a replacement for his meal but because this guy would blatantly eat the food in front of people not giving two cares who saw so my dad hatched a plan he decided to make exlax brownies and bring a plate to work with him now most of his coworkers hated ralph because hes already eaten their food and ended up in on the joke so they knew to steer clear my dad walks in with his lunch and sees ralph chilling out he tells ralph to stay away from his lunch and not to eat it and ralph agrees to do it needless to say food went missing and ralph ran between his office and the bathroom so many times he ended up shitting himself after cleaning up as much as he could ralph went to the boss and ratted my dad out saying he was poisoned by him my dad gets called in is asked about his food and told the boss that he told ralph to stay away from the food boss looks at ralph and asks if this is true ralph says thats not the point boss responds with sending him home because he smelled like shit and ended up transferring him to another branch a week later tldr my dad got tired of his asshole coworker eating his lunch that he slipped ex lax brownies as revenge

a few years ago i entered some of my photographs in the amateur section of the county fair while looking through my competition i notice one is submitted by a professional photographer from the area just to make sure it was who i thought it was i stuck around at the end and watched them pick their photo up at the time i was working at the local college as an event manager i ran concerts various smaller events fundraisers and helped plan graduation this same professional photograph asked for permission to photograph our larger rock concert i denied it the photographer submitted a quote to photograph the fund raiser i denied it finally it comes to graduation as graduation approaches i receive another quote from the photog along with several others wanting the job the session fee from the offending photographer is reasonable and the package deals that would be offered to the students for purchase were competitive with the other offers but i denied it this photographer lost out on about of session fees the chance to sell prints to students for an hour shoot and a nice portfolio building opportunity all they got was a prize from the county fair edit the photog in question was operating out of their own studio and had been advertising as a professional photographer for a few years minimum from what records i ran across

i was a rebellious little kid since young and as far as i could remember this happened when i was about my mum had a friend from china and that friend has a daughter lets call her d in this case d came to singapore to study and my mum wanted to help out by letting her to stay in our house while she continue her education she was about at that time if i wasnt wrong i remember there was this once she claimed that she has lost one of her accessories and her bottle of fingernail polish to which she made a big fuss out of it being so innocent i offered to find it for her which i did that bitch then went to tell my mother that i was the one that had stolen her items because i found it so fast and despite my cries and my pleas that i merely helped her to find it my mother refused to believe me and because of her that following night i was canned and sent to bed without dinner and not to mention all the additional punishment i was made to do the following day since then i bore a grudge towards her and i crafted out a plan she had her own room and whenever she heads out she would lock it up my mother has a pair of spare keys which she had cleverly hidden somewhere in the house so one day i happened to find out where the keys were and i used them to gain access to her room during that day she didnt bring her phone out and she had also left some electrical devices on her desk i stumbled upon a clear nail polish remover on her desk as well and i had this brilliant idea of what it seemed like a revenge i poured the nail polish on all the electrical stuff i could think of including the insides of her phone i then locked her door and put back the keys that following night i heard screams from her room followed by my mums shouting of i dont think its my daughter she doesnt even have access to your room and that following day i found the room vacant my mum then explained to me that d had moved out her room has now been transformed into my room and years later i still think that its the best revenge prank ive ever had since i was a kid 
not me but my wife and i were in a chinese restaurant in sacramento and enjoying a nice dinner a few feet away from us is a table with two semighetto high school age girls they had ordered this special meal huge combo of a ton of different foods meant for two or more suddenly we hear this yelling and the two girls have booked into the parking lot with the waitress unable to catch up after being pretty upset the waitresses start to clean up the plates and then start laughing as we were regulars they came and told us the story bitch left her brand new iphone i laughed and told her to call the cops she said no i sell the phone its worth more we all had a good laugh until this fat lady walks in and discretely says i think you found my phone as we were walking out the waitress gleefully replied oh yes we found it i think you accidentally forgot to pay your bill though awesome dinner tldr king hippo tried to book on a dinner and left her phone baby huey had to roll her ass back and pay the bill
i went to check my email on our shared computer and discovered it was already logged into an account my wife had made to correspond with her affair partner when i realized who this other person was a lot of things made sense in hindsight about how my wife had been acting the past several months the top email included the hotel room number and time they were set to meet i picked up her elderly and very traditional parents and told them i had a surprise i took them up to the hotel and found the room i pretended to be room service when i knocked and my wife answered in a state of undress her parents were really confused and she was extremely embarrassed then immediately angry i said something like have a nice life and left from what i heard my wife had to rely on her affair partner to drive her parents home since my wife didnt have her own car at the hotel she thrives on her parents opinion of her she always felt growing up that she never measured up to their standards so their approval was very important to her marriage is a big value to them and she got caught redhanded cheating from what i understand she is still very much on bad terms with her father as a result edit this is not my story i compiled it from comments in another thread rule states to copy the text instead of providing a link mod confirmed its okay to also provide the link link to the original 
this story starts out back almost ten or twelve years ago i had a pretty good job as a land surveyor made a good living life was good the rodman i had at the time he had to quit due to health reasons so i got a brand new helper all was going ok until he decided to be a complete bitch the job involved covering some pretty rough terrain lot of swamps chopping line in the florida summers crapload of snakes out great job for me but for this guy it was a reason to gripe and tell me just how much money he should be getting paid you know the kind well after a particular clusterfuck of a job we have to set a few property corners and get back to the shop nothis guy is too good to stay half an hour later to actually finish a job and proceeds to call his fiancee to come pick him up by the time she got there to pick him up id went and set the rods by myself it rather pissed me off well the guy being the pompous asshat he was had given me his business cardfor a window tinting thing he did out of his garagea few weeks earlier he had also been complaining that his neighbors were gay wheels began to turn in my head and i had a nice little fuck you plan in no time after work i went over to lillian alabama where the porn shops are and found a nice guyonguy mag and asked the cashier for a subscription form for it on the way home i stopped in a circle k and got a money order for one years worth of the mag with his address from the card and a nighttime driveby i got his neighbors address i filled it out in his name to his neighbors address and mailed it in about a month later he come in to work looking like someone had just kicked his puppy boss asked him what was wrong and even i was not expecting the reply my fiancee called it off she thinks im gay my plan worked a bit too well the neighbors got the mags in his name and went over to give them to him but she was the one they gave em to she opened the black plastic and the shit hit the fan i was biting the inside of my lips till they bled to keep from laughing because this big cornfed country boy would have killed me if he knew i was the reason the love of his life walked out and left him tldr sent gay porn to a coworkers neighbor and caused his fiancee to leave him 
okay technically this wasnt me and more my brother little bit of backstory i graduated high school almost a year ago and of course was going to need a part time job to cover my needs and whatever ill need for college my brother who manages a pizza franchise store and supervises a couple stores owned by his boss told me he can hook me up with a job but at a corporate store of the same company he knew the manager but i wanted to work at a retail instead of a restaurant so i turned his offer down i tried applying to jobs for about months but no place hired me simply because i was at the time with college going to start in a couple of weeks i was desperate and bit the bullet and asked my brother if he can still get me the job long story short i got it i liked working for the store that hired me i would usually cut and roll the dough that they use for the pizzas i loved cutting and rolling dough when i would cut with other crew members we would always tell each other crazy stories and shit and we would always have a great time after months of cutting and rolling i was just as fast as the people who taught me we would always challenge each other and sometime we would also get the manager involved with our fuckery and he would join us but the problem was it was a bit far away it takes around a minute drive to get to the store from my house sounds like a terrible excuse when some people drive up to an hour to get the their job but this is part time people although i enjoyed that store i felt like the drive wasnt worth it because there were different other stores that were closer to my house so i talked to my manager and asked for a transfer to the closest store and i got it people were sad i was leaving and i was sad i was leaving it was a great store but on the bright side i only had waste minutes worth of gas instead of this is the part that just made me angry at first the new store i was digging the people seemed nicer i was getting the usual same amount of hours as the last store i came in days a week and work the hours i was scheduled sometimes you would stay more if they needed you and usually they did but i started getting screwed about after a month being there the schedule was being made by the comanagers theres one is one of the funniest mother fuckers ive ever met we cut and rolled dough once together and it was fucking hilarious he used things that werent meant to cut dough to cut dough he got a pizza ring thats used mainly as a template for saucing and cheesing pizza sheet outs and went to fucking town he then got the blade from the dough mixer then started using that shit as fast as he could he used so a lot of things to cut dough that he really shouldnt be using to cut dough it was great he even used a fucking lid of a bin but the other comanager shes garbage and she was out to get me the good co needed time off for unknown reasons and all the duties of the comanagers was left to the comanager that hated my guts when we would do dough it was dead silent i couldnt spark a small conversation no matter how hard i tried the only time i ever talked to her was when i introduced myself and as it turns out shes the sisterinlaw of the manager who hired me she would only talk to one crew member and the managers only assistants cos and actual manager she is known to send people home early like really early she has sent me home after only hours of working she would send me home right after i finished the dough instead of teaching me or training me in something else if she felt like i was going to take more than hours to finish she would send someone to help me so she can send my ass home right after my hours so i couldnt just take my time she was the sole person left in charge of arranging the schedule and apparently her first decision was to only give me days for the entire week i didnt mind because i was scheduled for hours those days meaning i was going to only lose hour of work that week but i remembered who she was i knew i was only going to work for hours the entire week and i did luckily i was only scheduled for days that one week although every week after that i was getting days a week i was still only getting hours work weekly while in the other store i was getting up to so i called my brother asking him what i should do concerning my comanager problem he just told me to talk to the manager so i did and she had a word with the co and what does she do she schedules me on tuesday saturday and sunday managers have tuesdays and sundays off tuesdays i can make because i dont go to school tuesdays and saturdays were the only days me and the manager go in on the same day but i was put in closing crew meaning i would get there an hour after the manager has already left so my complaint only bought me one more hour of work i couldnt complain to the manager anymore because i would never see her anymore so i then call up my brother again with the bullshit im going through my brother again suggested the obvious of me going to the store when the manager is there and talk to her again even if i dont work that day i then told him about her and my old manager being brothersinlaw my old manager knows my brother in case you forgot and my brother showed his love for me in the greatest of ways he calls up the manager who hired me and asks if theres any comanagers that could use a better pay check and that one of the stores thats only cities away he supervises needs a comanager asap apparently my brothers boss pays his employees a bit more than the corporate stores so my old manager talked to his terrible sisterinlaw whom i hate btw about the offer and after about weeks of her telling the entire store that shes thinking about going to the franchise store she agrees and leaves my store and goes to the franchise thats not it my friends when you transfer from a corporate to a franchise store you basically have to quit the corporate job then get rehired at the franchise so she basically quit her job at my store but it doesnt end there apparently my brothers boss was thinking on closing and relocating that store because it wasnt earning enough money and she had no idea not even the manager of the franchise store had any idea she was happily working and earning more money for about months until the store owner decided to bite the bullet and relocated the store where was he relocating the store to detroit michigan we live in california she was offered the chance to keep her job but she would have to relocate halfway cross the country which she refused and got fired she tried getting her job back at my store and failed im not sure if it was because i spilled a lot of beans on how badly she did her job which are a lot btw but this is long enough already or if the manager realized that they can do their the job with just one comanager she complained to my old manager who complained to my brother and he claimed he didnt know that was gonna happen knowing dawn well it was im not sure what happened to her after that but id like to imagine her getting a shit job or having to start all over again at the bottom i didnt know that any of this was going down until i told my brother that she left the store for another one then he told me i love you brother edit wording edit forgot to put the first edit edit i understand that what i wrote in the description doesnt make her seem like she deserves it but i have replied to a comment with more reasons on how bad she was
throwaway just in case a while back i worked at a pretty large tech company with several branches across the country at one point my team had this manager player he was an idiot who did not understand any of the technology we supported he also sucked at managing any issue was immediately passed to his supervisor to handle players boss had requested weekly updates his peer in our other location would type up summaries of what his techs were working on projects and the like player got cced on them then directly copypasted them and would present the same weekly report to the same boss i mean really did he really think this would fly what a maroon player also hired his incompetent friends anyway player had kids by different baby mamas wasnt married to either of them this was over years ago and raised a few eyebrows in a corporate environment we had three females on our team and he situated them in cubicles directly around his cube player surrounded himself with the female techs like a harem and would joke about it one of the female techs newbie came over from the customer service department and did not feel very secure in her new position being new and not very technical newbie was young and very attractive she lived with her boyfriend pretty far away so she had a long commute to work player would instant message her frequently saying really smarmy stuff and constantly asking her to stay the night at his place since her commute was so bad newbie felt pressured and told me what was happening showing me the ims i advised her to go to hr but she refused to do so she didnt want to rock the boat we had gone through sexual harassment training so i knew that i could complain to hr even if the harassment was happening to someone else but i did not do so at the time as that isnt what newbie wanted i suffered under this morons micromanagement for a long time complaints to the big boss went nowhere because in a large company it is sometimes difficult to get rid of a manager one day though player went too far a gal in a different department came back from maternity leave and was showing off her baby pictures to coworkers player made a joke the baby really looks like me huh implying that he was the baby daddy he was not oh boy you bet your ass i complained to hr i mean really it was just a matter of time before someone would sue the company because of his actions shortly after the big boss announced that players position had been eliminated several months after that i heard that player had a had time finding a job but was now a store manager in retail quite a step down from his previous position im pretty sure he never worked in tech again as he has no linkedin profile justice is sweet i hope he learned his lesson but jerks like him usually dont the end
years ago i worked in the guest services office for a large hotel company we handled everything from basic reservations to i sent my kids into the room first and there was a couple in there already and now i have to explain to my kids what a blow job is but thats a story for another time a little over half of our properties were franchises which means that in exchange for the prestige of our name and our global booking system you had to operate according to several strict rules a whole book of them in fact in our office we enforced the rules and if your franchise didnt meet muster we could refund your guests costs and bill you for it goodbye revenue hello meeting with standards enforcement because our end of the operation was given a lot of power to resolve guest complaints our offices practices are also written into the franchise agreement therefore we had extensive classroom training as well as hands on training once the classroom was finished we required that anyone who contacted us received a letter to confirm the resolution of the letter and letter writing was therefore a skill we tested for in the interview process not that it mattered all that much because we had form letters for most contingencies and you could edit them to fit the specifics of a given situation also most of our busy season hires were college kids working a summer job and to make money for school of course every job gets a few rotten apples one of ours was a special case who i will call deeds deeds had a classic case of mine excrement doth not have an odour coupled with the best example of the dunningkruger effect i have ever seen firsthand in my life because i was a senior representative in the department with proven writing skills i would get to proofread the letters that the newbies were sending out if approved they could be sent if not corrections would be written in purple ink and returned to the employees inbox deeds never got off the proofreading list but it was noticed we was closing out his cases with a letter anyway boy with the added benefit of not faxing the resolution to the hotel gmowner one of these made its way to the ceo and that is when the shit hit the fan for deeds the letter that had him on the carpet said dear customer its youre own fault that you didnt understand how hotels work sincerely deeds this was sent to one of our loyalty program customers who spent over nights a year in hotels not your everyday stupid on mr deeds after begging for his job with the department manager and hr manager he was placed on an instant final warning and probation for six months i got the fortunate job of being his mentor i had to sign off on everything he did before he could do it effectively this had me doing two jobs the joys of being a responsible employee am i right eventually he seemed to straighten up and his parole ended immediately he started to fuck things up though at this point he had switched to a night shift so i never saw him but i was kept in the loop on his misdeeds because he was my broken toy for so long almost every day he would bully a night desk clerk into breaking the rules because he didnt want to explain the rules to a whiny customer or he would unilaterally decide to refund money for something we didnt cover like a check because the poor guest had to wait in long lines at disneyland during halloween or making the front desk pay to order a dozen pizzas because the hotels outdoor pool was closed on christmas those of us on the day shift would get angry calls from general managers and owners and we would have to arrange to get billed for these outrageous expenses needless to say this ate into our meager budget for nonbillable goodwill payments and management was pissed the department manager stayed late one night read him the riot act and told him he had to stay strictly within guidelines if it wasnt in the franchise agreement book and he couldnt get the poor sap at the hotel to read the required action on page xx then he couldnt do it last chance next mistake and youre out buddy deeds realized we all hated him and started looking for greener pastures he thought we were friends because of my six months of hell trying to get him to follow the rules so he came to me for advice on how to interview for a management position at a hotel hotels loved hiring from our office because we knew the rule book inside out and were so jaded by strange customers that nothing fazed us i saw an opportunity and have him every to my fevered brain could devise to get him gone gone gone he shortly got a job at a hotel in florida have his notice and spent his days bragging about how when he was at the hotel he would be calling us suckers all he time to make us do his work for him he was so proud that he was going to get to live on site for up to a year so he could save on rent too he basically stopped doing the job we were paying him for but instead of discipline we all decided it was better to let him slack than make someone else fix his mistakes soon he was gone and an exception was made to give him employee discount cards from our stock so he could stay at a couple of hotels on his drive from sally lake city to florida on his first night as a guest at a hotel he tried get the desk clerk to upgrade him to a bridal suite but fucked up two ways first he demanded it instead of politely asking for it and second it was the gm filling in for his night auditor who was sick the gm called to verify employment and one of the night supervisors have him the run down on mr deeds then had him hand the phone over to deeds and told him in no uncertain terms to be a good little boy go to his room not bother the staff and check out early the gm was on board with this so the rest of the night was uneventful the next night deeds pulled the exact same shit at the next hotel again the gm was filling in but he wasnt as easy going as the first time he called angry as a horny sailor fresh from a tour aboard a submarine who just found out that a vengeful wizard has turned every hookers vagina in new york during fleet week into a buzzing hornets nest just when young midshipman sonofabitch snaps the condom into place on his throbbing flesh torpodo livid i mean our good gm was he demanded deeds be fired for bullying him and his desk clerk and when told he only had the employee discount card so we could get rid of him h he demanded we take action we assured him that the appropriate steps would be taken we will call the night supervisor steve steve left a massive email and supporting faxed statements from both hotels managers for our manager who i will call jamie jamie called both hotels early the next morning having read the email about am when she got up to take some meds for her multiple sclerosis she was in the office two hours before we opened so she could call both hotels and discuss things with the managers then when the rest of us arrived she has every employee on staff that morning take some time and write up every bad experience we had ever had with dumb ol deeds the she faxed it all to the owner of the hotel where he had just got a new job called the desk to see when the owner would be in took a nap until said time then called the owner back to outline the situation and suggest they call the other two hotels for first hand discussions before making a decision when deeds rolled up in the uhaul the owner was waiting with two security guards a restraining order barring him from the property her uncle was a judge and did a favor for family a pile of documentation about his terrible behavior and a notified letter rescinding his offer of employment so here was deeds two thousand miles from and friends or family with no job no home and no sympathy tldr even caesar didnt have as many people sticking so many knives in his back so you could tell if he was man or porcupine edit appellate to appropriate 
i thought this subreddit might enjoy my tale of longterm revenge though reading other posts of the past couple of months i feel i may be far out of my league here nonetheless may you find some gratification in my revenge it started some years ago the culprit culprit was a middleaged clevel exec at my company when i started working there i was informed that culprit had some kind of grudge against the department i worked in not because he was wronged but something he carried with him from his previous job even without the warning culprit did a fine job of making it clear he was a douchebag he had no experience either at the executive level or his departments function a customeroriented function ironically and i found hed falsified his resume and his actions made it very clear he mismanaged his staff to such an extent the company lost k in just one instance and he manipulated this to get a k bonus culprit was also the oneupper if you told him your spaceship cost billion hed say his cost four solar systems and an ocean of kitten blood this is important at every turn culprit blamed my department for his own shortcomings he turned his staff against my department and in a sadistic twist of fate this legacy is directly responsible for much of the companys current failure but thats another story and in every single interaction with my department culprit found a way to be condescending manipulative irritating and a roadblock to success as an example i scheduled a meeting with culprit two other clevels and knowledgeable guy in culprits department to discuss how to eliminate a massive problem his staff was creating massive as in causing the company to miss client appointments and pay out lots n lots of money culprit agreed to the meeting time but canceled literally two minutes before leaving the other clevels and i hanging out in the conference room which was perhaps feet from culprits office when the clevels confronted him by walking the feet he said he was busy with stuff my blood is boiling even now to avoid a heart explosion in front of my computer please simply trust me on this culprit is a grade aaa twiceboiled rockstarlevel assholepounding shiteating douchebag and his main target was my cohorts and me fastforward to quite some time later by this point my entire department had left the company it was starting to tank and culprit had been laid off with a bunch of other people i was hanging out with my old boss and coworkers when someone mentioned culprit talk went from his douchebaggery to his new job to eventually how delicious it would be to exact some longterm subtle vengeance and dear reader this is how the website was born the revenge of idle curiosity i checked to see if wwwculpritsfirstandlastnamecom had been registered good golly it wasnt this i interpreted as a sign from on high and you know what happens when those are ignored whale intestines for those who dont of course i immediately purchased the domain name paying for the next years in a lump sum definitely worth it then i installed a crappy website framework and threw up a basic blog about page and forum all of these were liberally sprinkled with references to culpritsfirstandlastname ltsociallyfrownedupon sexual proclivitygt which was in fact both the sites title and the theme of the site itself i wrote blog posts that mirrored culprits writinggrammarpunctuation and adhered to his selfprofessed level of technical skill i seeded the forums with graphic conversations about sociallyfrownedupon sexual proclivity i set up the home page so it displayed the top explicit pictures from a google image search for sociallyfrownedupon sexual proclivity i littered culpritsfirstandlastname ltsociallyfrownedupon sexual proclivitygt about the site like bird droppings at a seagull festival then it went a step further after setting up the domain registration to change to a different company every three days i started searching for culprits name on the internet try searching for your own name youll probably get a bunch of spammy results from spokeo whitepages etc who knew that anyone can claim and edit those listings so i claimed every listing i could find and set wwwculpritsfirstandlastnamecom as the home page url using different throwaway email addresses i even created profiles for culprit on a few of the sites that didnt already have him and linked to culprits new website i can only imagine people casually googling culprits name clicking the seemingly innocent wwwculpritsfirstandlastnamecom link and running horrified from the explicit pictures that show up on the home page it helps me sleep at night every once in a while i google culprits first and last name often wwwculpritsfirstandlastnamecom comes up as the first or second result sometimes its buried on the second page every time though i get warm fuzzies thinking about how permanent online information is and how hard it is to remove something from the internet good luck culprit getting anyone to take you seriously again tldr why did you click
so back when i was i played ball in an allstar summer league i play catcher so i called all the pitches by the normal routine of putting fingers down to distinguish which pitch i wanted thrown anyways were playing a game against a good team and its pretty close however there was this one big mongoloid on the other team who would always look back at my signs while he was in the batters box to steal what pitch was coming every time he did it i told him to stop being a pussy and just play the game he did not adhere so after he got two base hits i was pretty fed up so i told my teammates my one teammate kevin came up with the idea to flip him off the next time he looked i thought this was a great idea in comes the troll into the batters box and without a doubt he starts to steal my signs again after the first pitch i called time and met with the pitcher on the mound and told him that i was going to flip this kid off and to then throw at his head he was down with the get down so i assume my position and see the kid peering into my crotch again for the signs i flip him the ol bird and start laughing the kid then exits the box and starts throwing a hissy fit about how i flipped him off the umpire is confused and thinks the kid says i was flicking him with my hand so he tells me to cut that out i keep laughing but the kid is still aggravated the ump then tells the kid to get into the box and play ball he eventually does the next pitch comes right at his head and he dodges out of the way at this point my entire team knows whats going on especially our large first baseman will the kid is frazzled but continues to try and steal signs and every time he looks i give him the middle finger the balls and strikes count gets to and so i call for a curveball no middle finger and whisper to the kid that a curveball is coming and that i bet he couldnt hit it well the curveball comes hits the dirt and he swings and misses we were playing regulation and since i didnt catch the ball cleanly the kid could try to advance to first he does exactly that but remember this kid is not the fastest player i calmly throw the ball to first base and he is out by a mile our first baseman will catches the ball and stands directly on the bag pretty much blocking the kids way the kid flustered then tries to bulldoze will will is huge and stuffs him with ease and the kid gets pummeled to the ground the umpire comes over and ejects the kid out of the game the kid starts crying and im still laughing we won the game and i was a homerun away from the cycle tldr fat kid tries to steal my pitching signs during baseball game i give him the finger get him aggravated strike him out and then get him tossed from the game 
i went to a boarding school in rural australia which had a problem with the leading brothers abusing kids a problem that went on for decades the older of us would try to protect the younger but there was only so much we could do at the time the police were very closely tied with the school and turned a blind eye to all but the worst behaviour and it took one hell of a lot of effort to even have that exposed thankfully through the long work of some of my schoolmates from the time the problems have come to light and reparations are being made back in the s and s we were powerless kids though after i left school one of the worst of the brothers was clearly still active a few of us wanted revenge thatd hurt him not too long after we were informed of the dates he took for a choir tour during the christmas break at the beginning of that summer we went and collected meat milk dog shit and all manner of stinky items and broke into his car he had this s mercedes he was all too proud of and placed it under the seats to ferment in the heat a couple of days later we realised roadkill would do a great number on it and we dropped the better part of a whole kangaroo in the back seat and so it went on for another six weeks until he returned foxes roos wallabies possums rabbits birds of all kinds and a couple of tortoises we stacked the inside of his merc with roadkill up to the dash by the end we needed to mask ourselves to even approach the car the stench was coming out the vents our quarry returned and we heard nothing of the car or the attack until a fortnight later when he disappeared no information on where he went where he moved to what became of him until the s when some of his deeds became public and so many adults came out of the woodwork with the knowledge of support and he stood no chance last i heard he was still in gaol for a while i regretted what i helped do i felt i should have done more and instead of playing around behind the scenes doing the somewhat heavy handed passive aggressive thing i should have worked hard to bring this man undone speaking to others affected has made me realise none of us ever had the power to do that alone and it was only after half a lifetime and a complete swing in the countrys culture against respect for institutions like my old school that it could successfully be exposed now im proud of the small part i played in making his life hell
my dad went to college at uw madison and would ride his bike between his classes now as some of you may know in winter it gets very cold in madison its not uncommon for it to be degrees below zero on one of these freezing cold days my dad was biking to class wearing his heavy ski mask and mittens to protect him from the weather as he rode down the street he saw ahead of him a man pulling out of his driveway in his car this man saw my dad approaching on his bike as he was backing out made full eye contact with him and then abruptly continued out into the street hitting my dad knocking him off his bike and bending the frame at this point my dad collected himself and upon seeing the man driving away hopped back onto his now bent bike and began to chase him now i should mention my dad grew up in a fairly sketchy neighborhood in chicago and as a sideeffect of being held up one to many times carried a folding buck knife in a holster on his side at all times as he was chasing this man in his car my dad pulled off his mitten with his mouth grabbed the knife and unfolded it at this point the man driving the car looked in his rear view mirror and saw my dad in his tarroristesque ski mask holding a mitten in his mouth and a large buck knife in his hand rapidly approaching his reaction was to speed up and run a red light at the next intersection at which point he was promptly tboned by another car as if this wasnt enough revenge a police car also happened to be waiting at the intersection and pulled up with their lights flashing to the car at which point my dad folded his knife removed his ski mask and rode by slowly smiling and waving tldr my dad was riding his bike a guy in a car looked at him then hit him my dad chased him with a knife the dude then crashed his car and got arrested
just an update im still owed my money but my war isnt totally unsuccessful or over for those who dont remember my ex employer took me for about k they converted back salary into shares based by convincing people based on deceitful assumptions and empty promises i reported them to the cra for tax fraud because they used sred tax credits incorrectly essentially using research credits for private profits i also reported them for every criminal act i could think of and contacted partners to inform them of how deceitful the company is i have no information on the audit if its happening or the progress or outcome i am not on the loop on that but the cra did say they would be randomly audited shortly however given that i dont see the insides of the company i cant say much i can however say that the big application i wrote for them is no longer in the wild it appears ive help ensure that the company lost one of its biggest contracts and that alone should financially surpass any money they owe me i ran into the ceo today and sat down for a informal discussion he claimed he cant pay me because then hed have to pay everyone very much a bullshit claim and easily worked around they could partially buy back shares from everyone and work towards being in the clear but clearly their interest is to horde their money and continue being dishonest scumbags i will be filing in small claims to reclaim my money and will try and do another update then but for now id like to at least say that ive done enough damage to the company that paying me would have been the easy solution everything else is just cake from this point forward either the audit will fuck them entirely and ill possibly get my money back but at least in fucking them ive been successful the revenge component is done now im just pursuing justice

so this isnt quite the normal revenge story as it all happened in a video game specifically eve online a spaceship mmo now for those that dont know it eve online is to hardcore gamers what hardcore gamers are to regular people its the most insane of the insane shit happens in eve that doesnt happen anywhere else ccp the developers basically have no rules in playing some very basic dont abuse bugs scamming stealing etc is all fair game its also slightly complicated there is something called plex which can be bought for real money and sold ingame it grants additional playtime and is a way to estimate ingame money to real money enter me bored depressed looking for something to do i decided to try yet another mmo and see how it went i joined one of the newbie organizations and it was miserable i learned but they were very restrictive so i jumped ship to an alliance in nullsec high risk high reward space and part of one of the larger coalitions at the time members gt corporations gt alliances gt coalitions there were fewer rules and it was more freeing and fun to play i quite enjoyed myself for a time but there was something i couldnt shake off the other members of the coalition they were toxic they belittled and berated everyone for trying to do anything for trying to help for trying to make things better anyone did something and it was met with a chorus of jeers i liked the alliance the coalition but i couldnt stand the members theyd go so far as to even occasionally scam each other and i got hit by this once most questions i had or mistakes i made were met with a torrent of abuse i quickly grew to hate the individuals but i couldnt jump ship again i was a marked man having been in this alliance i decided on revenge instead having a large amount of time on my hands i discovered something that i could do as a relatively newish player that most players didnt like doing that i enjoyed and with all my time i was able to do it a bunch leading to some minor appreciation of my work among the very few people who tried to keep the whole mess running again to choruses of jeers i earned a slight reputation and constant posting on the forums made me a known person so i started an investment doing all of the math showing people how it was a good idea and asking for a modest but not outrageous amount of money i managed to get it and slowly paid it back over months time for reference this tale encompasses almost months i continued my activities and slowly got promoted through the ranks i dipped and dabbled here and there always polite always helpful slowly my access grew and i was eventually invited to an inner moneymaking scheme where we trusted each other with good chunks of our money for all of us to make much more now with such a large group owning large amounts of rich moneymaking space with such toxic people how were we not invaded and kicked out of our space how did we get it in the first place we had a big brother bb who intially helped us get this space and it was wellknown that anyone who messed with us was also messing with bb this kept us safe except for skirmishes and people were willing to show up for skirmishes they knew wed win time goes by my activities lead me to being essentially inner circle but not quite the inner circle would decide things then task me and only me to do them and i became defacto head of intelligence for this very large members coalition and i still hated their guts and i still bided my time i paid off the investment in full smaller amounts than this had been scams and by this point i was fully trusted around this point bb decided they had enough of us that we didnt deserve our space and that they were evicting us my plan crystallized i knew i wanted to deal massive amounts of damage but this gave me the chance to do even more and i promptly messaged the head of bb explaining who i was what my plan was and would they like some help i was granted with doubt this has never worked before everyone whos ever offered to turn coats has been a plant and they suspciously asked me what i wanted in return for my services i told them i wanted nothing i just hated the coalition with a deep burning passion and wanted to see them burn i had been mentioning a plan for a superlarge scale investment and money making opportunity for awhile now and immediately put it into effect to make it look legitimate i had set the entire thing up as if it would actually happen giving so many layers to the deception that no amount of investigating would reveal any inconsistencies i asked for an outrageous amount and due to my previous activities and reputation i got it and more the stage was set the invasion began and as head of intelligence i was in charge of making all of our intelligence spreadsheets google docs were used i made them all handled the access and permissions and they were the only source of a large amount of our intelligence and i coordinated scouts during battles while in the command channels to better relay the intel while streaming the command channels to bbs commanders so they had perfect intel of what we were thinking and what we were going to do while gaining wartime access to most of the command forums i know at least two alliance fleets died without a fight due to the intel streamed i suspect many more fleets got killed as a result at last the moment was ripe i had gotten the massive investment i had access to various alliance assets i was still in the moneymaking group that gave each other assets and i was the owner of the intel documents i stole it all then proceeded to wipe all access to the intel documents i got away with so much stuff that i literally couldnt count how much i had managed to get i copied the command forums i finished it off with a taunting message to everyone in the coalition bb shortly won the war and the alliance shortly fell apart and offered me a spot i happily accepted and theyre a much nicer bunch of people internally theyre not nice to outsiders ive been pretty happy ever since my lifes turned around and all in all operation successful be nice to your teammates you never know what they can do tldr the people i was playing with were mean i helped burn their empire to the ground and stole everything not nailed down edit i forgot to mention the final loot tally it took me a few weeks to sell scrap or donate i gave stuff to some of the actually nice peoplesomeone who lost everything and would be quitting otherwiseand literally everyone who asked me for some and still ended up with billion isk in loot a plex at the time sold for m isk remember a plex costs almost edit forgot to mention i got to the point where i had the alliance paying for my membership edit since i was asked i realized i didnt post the value of a fleet fleets in eve for warfare of the type we were engaged in are fought primarily by battleships with a wellequipped one cost around m then there are a huge number of support ships usually costing less capitals cost a ton more but i wont get into them to the point where a fleet could well be halfbattleships halfsupport for the sake of numbers lets say the average ship cost m fleet cap out at people but often multiple fleets are created to form one large fleet confusingly still called a fleet from here on out ill just reference the one large fleet so i got two of them blown up at around people each time with ships costing something like m per person if anyone who has a higher understanding of fleet comps and costs wants to help edit these numbers id be glad to take it
right i know backstory is boring so ill make it brief i have a fairly serious speech impediment its gotten better as ive grown and developed confidence but it still gets me at really awkward moments as a result i am fairly quiet and hang out with a small tightknit group of friends at the time of this incident i was years old and in reasonable physical shape i am in the new zealand cadet corps so im an experienced camper and enjoy being in the outdoors at the end of year grade in the us everyone in my yeargrade went on a threeday hike we were meant to travel km each day so fairly challenging now it is at this point in my story that the antagonist shows his ugly face ill call him blimp because thats what he was shaped like he was fat nearly obese he constantly mocked me and my speech difficulty as luck would have it we ended up in the same tramping group the first day of the tramp began fine blimp ate two days worth of food supplementing himself with candy hed brought from home because of his weight he slowed down the group and by the end of the day wed only gone km at the end of the day i lay in my sleeping bag and the beginnings of an idea crept into my mind on the morning of the second day i suggested to our instructor that we increase the pace he was reluctant at first but i reminded him that we only had two days left and we had to travel almost km so he consented we set off at a cracking pace since everyone in the group was reasonably fit all of us could easily keep going all of us that is except for blimp you can probably guess what happens next blimp was forced to run in order to keep up and by lunchtime he was sobbing in pain shame and fear of being left behind edit realised i need a tldr so here it is fat bullying shithead is shamed on a forced march
im going to share my story of a girl that changed my life originally it was in a good way but then it got bad then worse then kinda good then really bad and soulcrushing so heres how it begins in the summer after my freshman year of college i met this girl who was older than me but she and i had a lot of mutual interests especially the games we played so we started talking she always seemed like the hard exterior type and i assumed that she had no interest in me but then we started talking more and more and i realized she was definitely attracted to me she told me about her divorce how he beat her and cheated on her and my heart just melted she was such a good person and no one deserves that kind of treatment even after this whole ordeal i still would never wish that upon her because thats fucking demoralizing and awful we started to get closer as we talked about our pasts our interests etc we connected a lot it had been months since the divorce and she was just starting to feel good again and knowing that i was a part of that made me happy to help her soon enough we realized we had true feelings for each other and wanted to pursue something more than just friendship so we did now heres one thing that im going to be honest about this was my first serious relationship in my past i have been with girls and only said yes to the bfgf label because they wanted to i was just looking for some fun but i was fine with moving forward if it meant that we could still have fun ironically id actually start to get feelings and then the relationship would wind up ending so naturally i had my walls up and decided to just start playing it safe and then i met this girl for once it didnt start physical it started emotional i was getting feelings and then i started getting physical it felt like things were going right hell fucking no lets call this girl bitch so bitch and i started off amazingly well wed have phone convos at night that ended with us falling asleep together wed have skype dates and wed game together it was getting awesome and i felt so close to her but now heres where i should mention one thing we never made our relationship public she wanted to keep it lowkey since she was still getting over her divorce well after the breakup i realized that she was ashamed of me and im guessing it had to do with the age difference the funny thing is she and i talked about meeting each others parents a lot and how it would be awesome for each of us given our personalities she meant so much to me and i would talk her through all the panic attacks shed have and try to be the best guy to her i fucked up in my previous relationships but this time i refused i wanted to be the good guy the sweet guy the great boyfriend hell i remember one time she posted one of those pictures with the quote a good guy wakes you up at am to tell you he loves you and had the he loves you crossed out and above it saying with cookies and ice cream so for our three month anniversary i sent her a box of oreo cookies and a gift card to cold stone and she was so happy and whatnot about it okay enough of this sappy shit its time to get to the bad parts first of all around five months into the relationship she just stopped talking to me i got really confused but assumed that she needed her space i would still reach out every now and then then on thanksgiving she tells me that she was relapsing with memories from her exhusband and i understood and told her that wed take a break the day after new years she called me crying saying how she wanted me in her life and how she loves me so naturally i felt great again and said yes months into this new relationship and i started realizing that one of the guys that used to game with us we played gw gw wow etc for proper context would always be extra raunchy with her and she would giggle about it and be the same way back naturally i wouldnt say hey fuck off talking to my girl like that because we still hadnt made our relationship public yet i would talk to her about it in private and she told me that he was just like a brother to her and thats all i had some apprehension because ive been in fucked up situations in my past with cheating but i trusted her so id tolerate everything that happened and just took it on the chin another months later she broke up with me i was planning on studying abroad at that point so her breaking up with me definitely set me off on a fuck this shit note and i left for london with a downtrodden state of mind i hated the world and didnt give a shit about anyone once i started deciding to work out i made friends with other guys who made it their summer goal to help me through this by showing me the proper techniques for the exercises i was doing and even helped me gain my confidence back through this i started meeting girls even had some fun throughout this and things were going well i was finally starting to wake up in the mornings in a neutral state rather than fuck the world but then i found out turns out that bitch fucked that brother friend of hers and less than a week after i left he actually drove down to where she lived to spend quite a lot of time with her i hear from him directly how this had been going on for quite some time and that he was having a great time with her he saw me as a friend and had no idea of my relationship with bitch i hope so now i was back to fuck everything my friends at the gym still helped me but this time i was lost i was empty i was worthless i thought that i was never meant to have a serious relationship i thought this was all for nothing and then i get a call closer to the end of the summer i had been working while studying abroad and had been making quite a bit of money doing it it was helping me to know that while learning a lot i was saving a lot too i had talked to her well before our breakup when we were talking about the possibility of moving in and i said how id wanted to save up during the summer anyways so at least its for something meaningful she was living with a relative so she was excited at the thought of us living together so this call was from her telling me how her house wound up getting burned down from some electrical issue i think i loose wire or something and she was upset and didnt know what to do she even told me how her dog died that dog was adorable and amazing i actually felt bad for her because she was a good girl i was just shocked i wanted to feel terrible for her but i was just not the caring part of me wanted to help her but after all of this crap with her cheating and talking to this guy while taking gifts from me and ignoring me oh one thing i should mention my grandfather died during our relationship and she didnt really console me like all she did was tell me how it was much worse for her when her grandfather died and start crying and get me to console her whenever i truly needed her and oh she never fucking told any of her friends or family about me i just couldnt bring myself to care i wanted to show that i was truly fucking done with her and that after all that shes done to me she doesnt deserve any of my love and caring she asked me if i could help in any way to send money to her in order to help her out when i told her id think about it she said that if possible a check would be best and that shed really appreciate it thats when i realized what i could do i wanted to be slightly subtle vindictive and spiteful all at the same time while i definitely loved her dog i know that bitch loved her dog so much more so i asked her for her address and told her id send a check she said thank you and then said she had to go and hung up yes exactly like that she didnt even say bye she literally said i have to go now thank you and hung the fuck up so i sent her a huge package of dog food with an attached note saying im sorry for your loss i blocked her on my phone facebook and steam after that tldr bitch cheated on me for the majority of our relationship tried to get me to help pay for her burned down home well after breaking up with me and me finding out about the cheating so i bought her food for the charred remains of her dead dog

a new place to live well my bil and sister have a few rental properties and were looking at buying another one they asked if i would be willing to rent it if they did being a single female in my early s i stressed to them i probably couldnt afford it but if it was in my price range of course i would but i also asked them if they should really be focusing on that right now maybe you should take care of bils cancer and worry about your real estate when hes better anyways you cant tell them what to do at all and they bought a house anyways well they told me i could rent the basement suite for less then my max price because they know ill take care of it i agree and we go about things well as im moving in they bring me a lease contract to sign but the rent is over more than what i had told them my max price was i question them about it with my crap half moved in naturally and they kind of bullshited me by saying things like oh we thought it would be okay and i guess we forgot to factor in a b and c okayyyyy i think to myself but arguing with your bil that has cancer is extremely difficult so i reluctantly sign and accept my lack of social life due to my inflated rent fast forward to last year my bil is getting significantly worse and given under months to live i made the trip to the hospital hours away several times as much as i could afford and often caught rides up there as well and he looked bad as in i didnt think hed make it another month bad in canada where we live health care only does so much and basically told him there was nothing left they could do for him well i did some research and found a specialized cancer treatment center in the states that gave him a shot at beating it i asked my sister to make a few calls knowing more than i did about his specific situation and see if they pull take him she told me they would but it was far to expensive i asked how much and she said about i immediately got together with friends and family about starting to raise some money i had also found out the they didnt have life insurance with small children and they would lose everything when bil died essentially they were right fucked now im not the type of person to hold events or generally just be social at all i actually have mild social anxiety and dropped out of college because of it but i somehow managed to rally together the entire community a friend started them a gofundme page and gave my sister control my sister also started a second one on youcaring i found a place that would give us seats free in a bar for a fundraiser in which we could sell ticket to unfortunately it was around christmas time and the only date they had available was a last minute cancellation about a week and a half away now i dont know if any of you have thrown any type of event but thats not enough time to organize crap like that somehow and dont ask me how because it was such a blur and i dont think i slept at all i managed to organize hundreds of people find a band sell all of our tickets collect auction donations create gamesrafflesetc to bring in more money get several large corporations to donate moneytimeadvertising find decorations create a slideshow and get a ton of personal donations over dollars to be presented to the family because they were going through a tough time all while working a full time job while planning i became extremely concerned with the legalities and expressed that in depth to my team all auction items must be watched at all times all money must be tracked all paperwork copied and account for etc i also told my sister to not worry about a thing just worry about taking care of bil while she not only helped by completely forgetting to do everything she insisted on doing but talking down to me and ignoring all of the important things i was trying to express she was actually a huge bitch the entire time i tried to shake it off assuming she was just stressed a few days before the fundraiser i tried to get the treatment center info from my sister for my speech but she kept blowing me off so i called the center myself the totals that my sister were asking were completely different than what the girl on the phone told me at the end of the conversation the girl says so youre bils sister thats so weird his wife called the other day and didnt seem nearly as interested in the payment options as you are around the same time i noticed my sister has changed to fundraising goals from to i was far too busy to give it much thought at this point though so the day of the fundraiser my sister walks in and i say genuinely pleased to see her oh awesome you made it have you decided if you want to be involved at all she scowls and says i dont even want to fucking be here im a pretty ballsy person and any other day i would have promptly punched her in the face and walked out but this was for my bil so i smiled and said oh im really sorry to hear that why dont you have a seat my dad and just relax put all your food and drink on my bill and ill take care of it weve got you a ride home if you want to drink and ill take care of everything else for you i love ya sis as mc host and the main organizer of everythjng i was running around like a chicken either my head cut off the whole night the only times i saw my sister was sitting on other guys laps bitching about her husband bidding on auction items how fucking innapropriate or telling her friends im a cunt she also was a bitch to my friends and had i known that at the time i would have called it off right then and there you do not fuck with my friends who have supported not only me but you through this about half way through the event one of my team had approached me telling me a gift card had gone missing fuck thats all on me i quickly rallied everyone to help but my sister had quickly come over and told everyone it was taken care of i forgot about it until my friend that donated that gift certificate showed up and asked about it i had no answer and sister was effectively evading me all night the next day since the fundraiser ended up running until after am i called around to everyone except my sister looking for the gift card i put about peoples stories together to figure out what happened my sister stole the fucking gift card for herself from her dying husbands fundraiser then she blamed everything on me and made a bunch of wild false accusations basically i got numerous phone calls texts emails and facebook messages to the point i had to shut my phone off and deactivate my facebook telling me what an awful person i am and how could i steal something from bils fundraiser and blame it on my poor sister ummmmmm what what thats good for my depression and anxiety so i called my mom bawling telling her i wanted to die and i dont understand she yelled at me and told me to apologize to my sister fuck that i didnt speak to anyone in my family for over months i had concrete evidence proving she did it i could have got her charged i spent my entire vacation fund on them and didnt even get a fucking thank you my theory that i pieced together a few weeks after is that my sister expected bil to die before we could raise the money to send him for treatment leaving her with a nice little chuck of money to take care of her stupidly expensive lifestyle very expensive vehicles houses property on a lake a holiday trailer quad boat etc well shit i dont do anything halfassed within a few days we had raised half the money by the end he had enough to go before she changed the total out of the or so raised i single handedly raised over also who leaves their dying husband as home to look after their small children under to go to mexico a week after the fundraiser i decide to let herself shoot herself in the foot and just move out of the house they owned asap this happened to coincide with their crosscanada trip and they tried to sue me they had no grounds to do so and i actually ended up with bucks from them ha but now im getting a little revenge i couldnt bring myself to tell the entire world what they did though i easily could have but i did decide to fuck with them while i lived in the rental i did a bunch of work on it for them for free so there was plenty of extra paint drywall etc around i looked up the most common and troubling pests in our area and how to attract them then i went shopping the list included fish heads shrimp pest attractants clearance meat etc i left the place immaculate except for the rotting food in the walls yup i punched a hole in the wall filled it up in several places drywalled muddedtapped and painted over it i hear the place is unrentable now and going through renovations tldr i spent an obscene amount of time and money on a fundraiser that my sister stole a gift card from and blamed on me so i filled the walls of her rental house with rotting food edit a word edit for those asking my bil is still alive though i have heard his health is declining so far as i know things change quickly around here and i dont really care enough to keep up he has not been send to the treatment center that we all fundraised for they say they cant afford it which is a lie i know all the numbers of the fundraiser and how much it was to send him there they have not sold a single thing they own but he is supposedly attending treatment a province over they say that the money is going towards that but the treatment itself is actually free i believe they have used some of the money to fly him over for treatment thats all i really know
hi prorevenge im posting here on the suggestion of some fine people over at rtalesfromretail this story chronicles how someone got what was coming to them even in the otherwise powerless position of an employee in a customer is always right society warning wall of text below ill preface by saying that ive been working in a grocery store for over a year now and have culminated my own collection of nightmareinducing runins with people hellbent on making everyone around them despise their entire existence this story starts with my second day out of training on a register as a cashier it is currently super doubles week where our store will double the value of coupons up to meaning a coupon is worth for nongrocery workers this is obviously very bad for a new employee because the store gets a very bad case of the crazies and in customers will actively try to scam you to get away with invalid or fake coupons management doesnt seem to mind however and im thrown on a register still quite nervous about the job unsure of what to expect fast forward hours later im approaching the end of my shift im a little more confident and more proficient and have already seen a lot of really scummy customers then it comes to my lane barely of shoddilydyed blonde scraggly hair a gucci purse a torn ragged sweater and bunny slippers yes thats right bunny slippers it to be referred to as ms a is an infamous customer who is unbeknownst to me at the time notorious for picking out new employees and scamming them she has picked me out because she spent hours at a time in the store for around a week to see who is new who pays attention to what and who her best option is really if it wasnt pathetic id be impressed anyway the transaction goes underway and she being a veteran scumbag gets away with coupons her total i am told this by the customer service clerkcsc who reviewed my till it was at that time i vowed to get her back and get her back good because beyond being rude and smelling a little like onions she had a smug look of hah im better than you and you work in a low job where you cant even say anything about it you see im a vindictive sonofabitch and i really dont like getting taken advantage of as a preparation for my plan i took a picture of the coupons she used with my phone and stashed them back in the folder where they are kept fast forward months i am now a selfcheckout clerk much better at the job now the csc who first told me about ms a scamming me is a good friend of mine at this point another super doubles week is upon us and ms a sure enough makes another appearance same slippers same purse same hair i ask the csc if she can make a copy of the transaction ms a makes by using the customer service desk computer the csc agrees staying that its probably a good idea if she ever does get caught ms a knows not to try going through my line by now as i am experienced so she goes to a newer cashier to try to scam i go to the new cashiers station to help her bag i dont say anything about the coupons despite blatant scamming but i do snap a picture of the coupons and grab a copy of the receipt from the csc at the end of the shift to store away ms a came in more times that week and repeated the procedure i was able to collect evidence at of the instances fast forward months i am now a coarse wartorn veteran of retail working as a csc dealing with the worst dregs that society can cough up at me i have now culminated about fraudlatent transactions that ms a has pushed through a register at this point all showing in rather great detail what items were voided how many coupons were used and even what the value of the coupons were and when they were scanned my old csc friend is a comanager at this point and has been in on my plan for vengeance for a while now and is actively trying to help me catch her in the act during a slow day my friend calls me from the front desk to her office she says she has a plan to deal with ms a for good she will ask the security guard who watches selfcheckout when the tills are pulled at night to contact the police to be on standby during our upcoming super doubles week i didnt know that it was possible to request that police remain on standby for such issues but somehow my comanager friend did it fast forward month super doubles i prepare for a rough week of but i want this with this coupon theyre the same thing and why didnt this coupon that says do not double double then it happens ms a fumbles into the store i hear over my earpiece ms a is here novvacaine tell the security guard i hurriedly do and sit back anxiously waiting for the fireworks ms a blissfully unaware of the world of pain about to be lowered on her slowly scans the shelves for what she wants for over hours if youve worked in retail before you know these types of people dont they ever get bored of going from store to store christ go watch some tv or something she goes to a very new cashier and proceeds to attempt scam the hell out of the poor girl asking to void one item add another scan one coupon clear another item then add another item a relatively simple confusion technique used to get away with getting extra coupons for clarity purposes i will iterate that this is fraud and theft dont do it and if you do stop it all the employees know your face name and buying habits i make a copy of the registers actions up front as i always do with ms a but this time was different as soon as ms a swipes her card two police officers sidebyside walk up to ms a and ask her to step aside and speak for a moment ms a obviously distressed yells no leave me alone im doing nothing and tries to push past the officers the two officers are not in the business of dealing with her crap and quickly grab her and take her aside bunny slippers in tow her gucci purse still on the counter the purse precariously perched on the edge falls over after the commotion unopened bottles of nyquill and a pack of lithium batteries roll out onto the desk i couldnt contain my laughter and i said aloud fucking score and then proceed to close off the cashiers lane and guide customers elsewhere ms a didnt return a police officer came and took the purse the days security tapes my copies of the months of transactions and took a picture of the attempted stolen goods nothing else was said about ms a for quite some time fast forward to yesterday evening my comanager friend and i are at the front desk she is working in the front office in accounting and i am counting tills from the day i hear her on the phone nothing too unusual a little laughing muffled speaking and so on she steps out from the office with a grin from ear to ear ms a just got convicted of theft and some drug charges long jail time from what i understand your transaction records pretty much sealed the case apparently the dm of the store personally was at the court to see how it all played out holy shit best day ever see i like to think i learned something about the nature of retail and the customer is always right at the end of this ordeal its just a baiting game to see who is willing to step in shit enough times to eventually start smelling so bad they cant deny it anymore it may not always work but when it does sweet baby jesus its like christmas and when they do catch the people responsible like ms a quickly found out they soon learn that there are no coupons for bail
my mom lives in a college town with her partner and one of her passions is gardening they like to sit out on the porch on nice nights and were doing just that when a drunk college bro parks in front of their house and starts walking through their front garden my mom points out that hes walking through her garden and he calls her a dyke cunt and continues on to their neighbors still through her garden who are throwing a party mom who is pretty handy takes a valve stem remover to his tires and within minutes all four of his tires are flat drunk college bro returns to his car now even drunker doesnt notice and drives off on his rims mom calls the cops
tale reminded me of the time my boss was having lunch and got blocked in by a ups truck the parking in front of the restaurant was diagonal and you had to feed a meter for up to minutes of parking not unreasonable and usually plenty of time to eat lunch or shop bob john was a good guy and a good boss but he had his limits these limits were tested when he found his work van blocked in by a ups truck when he came out it was one of those big ones you know the type this was not the first time so john lit a cigarette and waited patiently before being joined by another person who had parked there and was now blocked in surely the ups driver would be back shortly after all it only takes a few minutes to do a delivery and such doubleparkers were usually gone in a short amount of time this was not one of those times after about or minutes he began to seek out the offensive driver peeking into several local restaurants amp shops but no luck the ups van stayed where it was john was running out of cigarettes and patience and he had appointments to keep he then looked inside the open door of the ups truck hoping to find a clue as to where the driver might be clues were not to be found but the keys were still in the ignition hmmmm he looked around again still no sign of the driver so he climbed into the driver seat and started the engine put the massive truck in gear and moved it forward far enough for both him and the other guy remember the other guy who was blocked in could get out but now the truck was in the way of other cars feeling that the rude ups driver had already used up his allotment of doubleparking time he decided to keep going he smiled at the other driver and drove down the street he later described the feeling as a heady mix of exhilaration and apprehension half expecting a shout of indignation from the driver or a police siren demanding he stop stealing the truck but none came he proceeded to the end of the block then drove past the intersection and around a curve still not good enough he turned into a residential area made another turn and parked the truck next to a fire hydrant and blocking the entrance to an apartment driveway before walking the few blocks back to his truck along the way he stopped at pay phone this was before cell phones and called the local police department and as a concerned citizen reported the illegally parked truck which by that time had been illegally parked for about an hour technically the truth not sure what happened to the truck or the driver john went on to his appointment and we never heard any more but we did notice that ups trucks never parked in that area for more than five minutes after that edit speling
stoicassistant points hours ago it was april st and i was in cramming mode for exams i had popped an adderall and was extremely concentrated on my work when all of a sudden my phone buzzed unknown number heyy i saw ur ad on cl and i wanna buy ur phone please wrong number i get back to work and within minutes my phone rings a different number hi id like to buy your phone please sorry youve got the wrong number as soon as i hang up i realize oh fuck this is a prank i get on craigs list and immediately find out that my roommate is selling my brand new iphone for us call me asap at that motherfucker in the next two hours i got a total of probably calls and texts i was gonna get him back good with the adderall still coursing through me i racked my brain for the best possible prank i could pull then i remembered i had introduced him to the deep web two days ago we were surfing it we had checked out the armory the silk road even the assassins advertisement pages and at one point on his computer we stumbled onto child porn i knew how i was going to prank him when he got home there was an official fbi envelope waiting for him inside this i lifted correct names signatures court addresses court dates and official language other than misspelling appertaining but that didnt really matter as soon as he opened it up he almost started crying i had to tell him it was a prank within seconds because he just broke down 
i was in an accident that left me unable to work for quite a spell it was obvious that i wasnt at fault it was an open and shut case but that means nothing until the judge brings his gavel down the claim exceeded the amount of insurance that the other guys had so the insurance company had nothing to lose by dragging the case out which they did their lawyer managed to get adjournment after adjournment hoping to starve me out and settle for a pittance he almost succeeded in the years following the accident the bills piled up my marriage fell apart and my credit rating was destroyed i hocked and sold anything i had of value just to put food on the table i eventually had to get foodstamps to survive i lived in a small town and this was humiliating to say the least the worst part was the little half smile their lawyer would give me at the end of each adjournment one night while trying to glue a toy together for one of the kids a revenge plan presented itself it was time for him to feel what it was like to have his life interrupted the courthouse had a several story parking structure that everyone used it offered a number of good hiding places this was before there were security cameras everywhere i took a small pin cut the head off of it so it was just a small straight shaft with a pointed end and then super glued it to his door latch i did stay to watch and sure enough he jammed his hand into the pin while opening his car door the pin fell to the ground he never saw it by the way he jumped and screamed im guessing he thought it was a burr on his latch i then waited a few hours and then used a pay phone this was years ago at the court house and dialed his office when he came to the phone i asked him how his hand was i disguised my voice he immediately made the connection i then told him that he had pricked himself on a hypodermic needle that came from an aids patient his scream was most satisfying the whole call lasted less than a minute i did see him in court a few months later and he looked like hell i wasnt in a loop to learn how he reacted but i assume he underwent a lot of aids testing before he was satisfied that he didnt have the disease im guessing hoping that he did have a certain stigma during that time 
in i was a fine and applied arts major in college basically i was a guy who loved to paint as such i took a job at a major retail arts and crafts chain we had a great group of people that managed every department i would work hours per week it was primarily for the discounts i would receive on art supplies in fact when old oil colors had expired i would receive both the markdown price and the employee discount life was great pay was good and everyone got along i had worked there for months and everything seemed to being going well until they hired a new person as their assistant store manager her name was unique this only matters because of future background checks but as soon as she was hired she decided to change things about the store i am a person who is liberal in many respects particularly when it comes to fair and equal treatment of all people but she did not see it in that manner she was a very militant lesbian at first we seemed to be friends she asked me what i thought about her lifestyle and my response is the same as it is today everyone deserves the same treatment and opportunities i dont care what you do i am neutral in all matters that was until she started firing people and getting her friends jobs in this store she had a friend whom wanted a job in the framing dept well she went out of her way to fire a person she was targeting people so she could hire her friends she ever fired the gay guy from his position in the floral dept so her friend could get a job there she was just a terrible person with a chip on her shoulder things came to a head when she made false accusations against both the manager and the other assistant manager for harassment against her gender preference she had her friends back her claims up i knew that these individuals made no such claim as one was a pretty good friend i knew i was next and low and behold that day came what she failed to acknowledge was that i had been watching and waiting prior to my termination they became to comfortable in their positions she and her friends would love to visit this local karaoke bar after work and sing what she failed to understand was that i knew they also loved to go around the back of this bar and smoke pot between their sets so i simply called the cops and told them that these people are smoking pot behind this bar needless to say she was arrested as were her cohorts apparently as per the grape vine they were holding tldr dont fire people and replace them with your own friends if you are going to do illegal activities and make them know to the staff that hates you
so ive been only lurking reddit for a while but now that ive discovered this subreddit im surfacing because i have a story for you this is by far the worst ive ever done to someone else but i dont actually regret it heads up this story is long it happened when i was in my third and last year in a religious high school the boy in question was in my class and even though he was friend of my friends id never actually interacted with him semester started and hes nice and friendly with me so i was too then he stepped it up acting the gentleman offering to carry my things from my locker to our classroom even if those things were just a couple of notebooks this is when it actually started ive always been a private selfsufficient girl i dislike it when people offer to do things for me that im perfectly capable of doing myself so after a whole day of offering to carry my books at the start of every class i told him something like how i appreciated his wanting to help but that i was most comfortable carrying my things myself and if i ever needed help i would ask him i was raised polite and i will die polite so he backed off one day the next he kept at it and the next and the next every single class for almost the whole semester it didnt matter how many times i said no thanks or how many times i asked him to stop or how by midsemester i resorted to outright ignore his offers he would sit close to me and take my things without my permission sometimes he would forcefully take my books from my hands to carry them himself he would poke me to find my ticklish spots and when he found out i dont have them hed poke me harder like he thought the tickling spots were deeper and hed find them if he kept digging and that was actually painful he would ambush me everywhere and he would loudly imply i was lesbian with my bff this was a very religious school with textbooks on how homosexuality was a big sin so you can imagine how well it would have gone if direction got wind of that he was vulgar and seriously nasty im sure he stalked me at least once some people thought he liked me now im also very nonconfrontational and i have very high levels of patience and tolerance that one professional told me arent exactly healthy so didnt tell him to fuck off just kept politely asking to stop but he just didnt the school wasnt helpful at all he was and i was about to be as well so were adults who should had been able to talk this out with civility when that semester ended and the very last one of high school started i was dreading my first encounter with him it went on like usual but to my own surprise i was starting to discover i may actually had a finite supply of patience i asked again for him to stop and still he refused to listen i cant remember if it was by the start of the semester or halfway but i do remember we were changing classrooms to take a class called values it was like ethics and religion rolled into one it taught you how to be a better person which given what happened i find hilarious it was very early so the teacher and most of my classmates hadnt arrived yet the seats were arranged in a huge circle and he sat next to me seats were those chairdesk hybrids fyi he immediately took my mechanical pencil and i snapped it back he took my notebook and held it out my reach then he fucking poked my side like he wanted to stab me with his fingers and thats it thats the moment when my patience ran out and complete outrageous fury overtook me i saw black like my vision just went tunnel on him and all i could see was the damn smug smirk he gave me every time i asked him to stop over six fucking months of having to stand his creepy bully self id had enough of that motherfucker he lowered my notebook when he poked me and his hand was splayed on top of it over his desk i still had my mechanical pencil in my hand grabbed so tightly it was almost shaking i was so angry i didnt care about consequences i stabbed his hand with my pencil he was in shock didnt scream didnt move just stared at me face blanched open mouthed eyes big and fearful like he was seeing me for the first time and i was something too scary to comprehend i leaned forwards and just whispered leave me alone then i took my pencil my notebook and sat back in my seat all while watching how blood trickled down his hand mind you the force with which i stabbed him wasnt that great just enough for the lead sleeve of the pencil to break skin and lodge the lead between two knuckles nevertheless it was strong and painful enough to send the message i wanted he never again approached me now im not sure why he didnt tell on me be it shame guilt or whatever else i was never called for it even when im pretty sure we werent alone in the classroom so he could have had witnesses this was ten years ago and i last saw him about six or seven when a common friend hosted a generation party he came up to me and as greeting he showed me his hand the skin had healed around the lead which he never took out because i could see a tiny black dot between two knuckles
this story takes place in scotland united kingdom and is looooong so apologies in advance ive had some dumb luck the past years of my work history i am an administratoroffice type so i applied for a job i had been out of work for years prior due to a hormone condition and depression at company a and got a job as a call handler in a telephone answering service over a few years i kept that same shitty job title and pay but was actually more the office manager due to the workload and how much of a distance there was between what my daily work was compared to anyone else so long story short i lost a baby the company owner made a comment in front of me to a client should have kept a hand on her hapenny meaning i should have kept a hand on my vag and not had sexconceived so i walked out without notice and because i was the only one running admin in the place it all stopped and she lost her biggest client d i landed another job at company b as an admin assistant it should have been easy something low key to keep me financially until i could recover from losing the baby also at this time i had moved house and was saving for my wedding which was made known to the owner of the company that is why i applied for the lower ranked and paid position within the year i was running an entire central production unit for a chain of cafes and delis still on low pay and shitty admin assistant job title you see a reoccurring theme here as i was about to demand a pay rise and proper job title for the work i did the owner puts the whole company into administration and cuts everyones hours i sucked it up to keep the place going i worked hard and got the cpu into profit owner says everyone needs to slash their hours more because other depts are losing money i refuse to cut mine im already down to the bone financially he agrees to have a meeting about it but instead jets off on holiday i hear back from company c re a role i applied for as an admin learn i have a new job to go to so walk out the very next day the place is still in administration many years later with massive job losses and they closed half their locations turns out my work was the only thing keeping the cpu open and when i left they had to close it down because no one else knew how to run it and they failed a hygiene inspection too company c takes us to the true prorevenge at first things are amazing great hours pay and im treated really well i start to put the past behind me thinking the way things went at the last two companies must be a fluke company c rewards my hard work with a pay rise and better job title after months but then they start to take me for granted after months of being there i am moved to the sister company which is the installation branch fitting insulation under government grants to residential homes i am to run the installation and warehouse operations with a small admin team and it will be temporary with my reward being a move to office manager when the current manager angela goes on maternity leave on this basis i accept the idea was when angela comes back she will be moved to oversee another dept so while i am running installations i have a nervous angela to accomodate as she is still my manager in theory and wants me to use her crappy basic spreadsheets so she can feel like she is still in control but i also have directorowners swishy stupid and sly constantly coming in and contradicting each other over what they want and targets etc i juggle making everyone happy meet the targets and get processes and procedures in place oh and i am still doing tasks from my old role as they dont have anyone else to take care of that i have issues with the team they hired to do admin under me lazy slutty and shy lazy plays on facebook all day slutty flirts and chats all day and shy is quietly handling way too much but too afraid to speak up so i report the team issues and they get pulled into a meeting remember i am a senior administrator not a manager i get brought in afterwards and director stupid decideds that they are all perfectly fine and competent and its my fault they arent doing their jobs i suck it up thinking he may be right and try to work on my management style nothing changes in fact it takes director sly coming in on a day when all are off and i am doing all of their jobs by myself for the bosses to notice how little my team actually have to do but again why do anything about it when mora can take it on and cover it all as well nothing is done about the stooges and my workload continues as is shortly thereafter it is announced the new office manager will be claire i am livid but think maybe i am going to be made the official installations manager as this is hinted at by other managers i have at this point only been in the new role months then the stress got to me and i was off ill for a week while i was off everything fell apart my admin staff stopped doing any work at all and some installs were reported as complete when they hadnt been so director swishy swoops in and orders the whole place be audited he suspends me and warns me to look for another job he tasks the audit to claire claire is years old and this is her second job ever claire looks and acts much older than she actually is so you get fooled into thinking she is better than she is she is also the type to blame others for her mistakes or great at hiding them she gets to the root of those installs being declared complete when they werent as one installer presigning his paperwork he would have brought that in and given it to slutty who should have then rebooked the job and put the paperwork back out but of course she didnt because she wasnt doing any work while i was off so the bosses cant pin the blame on me before i went off sick i was supposed to be off for day and had left a detailed list of everyones daily job and tasks so other managers would know who does what and decide to pull me back into my old role and put lazy slutty and shy into lesser admin roles this means no promotion for me they then hire a new admin team and make one of them the fucking manager she has no experience and sleeps with the installers but wait it gets better months later i am now working directly under director sly and the operations manager lizard king in fact i am doing all of lizard kings work and taking abuse and bullying from him as no one else can stand working near him i am doing jobs well outwith my remit like tendering for work and running the entire qms i am in effect the assistant ops manager no pay rise or job title though now we get to the end i effectively hold the keys to the kingdom there is no part of the business i dont know and havent run or had a part in getting up and runnng i am relied upon for almost everything they call me the cornerstone of the office at this point ive been with company c less than years claire is still called the office manager but all she does is oversee a small team who submit completed installs to the funder for payment she doesnt know anything actually office manager related i have a run in with director stupid he allowed lizard king to bully his assistant so she quit i am forced despite protesting to also take on her work which is wiping his dumb ass he calls me after hours with stupid comments like did you photocopy x and call y after i emailed him to say i had before i left work and verbally told him i had emailed him i arrange a really important compliance audit to allow time to get it done right and he calls them behind my back and rearranges cutting the time i have to do the work in half this compliance audit costs us thousands and is really important to get more work its all too much and i get sicker and sicker finally i decide i will quit i

so as a quick background for those who dont know mtg magic the gathering is a competitive card game with cards ranging from to in price at our local game store theres a guy whos known for being pretty dodgy with trades he always has the latest cards but if you want to get them you kind of have to throw a few extra dollars worth of cards towards them regardless of whether or not your cards are worth more harder to find or such so my partner sees that said person has scublands very powerful cards that essentially give you colours of mana what you use to cast cards without any downside ie pretty much better than every other land out there to date they are worth at the time in mint condition and are pretty hard to find so of course she calls me excitedly asking if we can get them or not to which i say sure a week goes by and we begin to notice that the cards seem pretty different to the average card visibly no difference but after some testing it becomes apparant that they are fake after parting with for the cards you can understand why the both of us were upset that wed paid for something worthless unusable and reputation damaging if we continued in trading them off after confronting said player about these cards they inform us that they didnt know they were fake so hes not going to refund us the money even if we gave him back the cards our shop owner says that he cant do much to stop this and suggest we come to a deal between ourselves which the guy is percent opposed to this made me angry when he goes to the bathroom i check his folder and notice he has many high value trade cards that seem to have also been faked and he has been trying to trade for cash real cards or various other things from people in the shop so i picked the folder up passed it to the store owner who knows magic like the back of his hand who determines that they are fake indeed but he has to witness the guy trying to sell them the guy comes out the toilet and we pass the folder to him stating we thought someone had left it there and we were just worried as he almost caught us he pays himself into a high level tournament that cost to enter in the lgs and proceeds to get to the final round with almost in prizes this is a big deal so the owner and i come over to the table and request to deck check the deck hes playing with making sure his deck is within the rules standard practice in the tournament he passes the deck over and the owner pulls out each fake card in his office in front of myself stamps them with a large stamp with the word proxy aka not a real card in giant red ink hands the deck back disqualifies the asshat from the tournament as well as requesting that he does not trade here until he trades non proxyfake cards the guy flips his shit demands his money back demands proof which the store owner then gives followed by general swearing and name calling and the like the store owner looks him in the face tells him bluntly that he is calling the cops for fraudulent trading or something like that and unless he hands his folder over with the fake cards he will see him in court and make sure he doesnt play in any of the other stores around the state the guy red faces starts screaming to which the store owner plain and simply picks him up and moves him outside hes a fairly built guy surprisingly he bans the person from coming to his store and says that if he doesnt leave immediately he will end up with a night in a prison cell i go up take the guys trade folder and sell the very few real and good cards in his folder for about and leave the fakes in a bin with the folder in question with the guy not to be seen again i got my money back and after hearing a bit of news from a store owner close by i found out that the guy had tried the same crap in another store and was immediately caught out due to our store owner spreading word of him hasnt been seen since owner also offered a free tournament with same prize for all participants in the tournament scumbag got to finals in so everybody won tldr magic card trader scams of cards gets caught due to my self and good store owner gets kicked out and banned without being able to grab his folder get about from the remains and his expensive fake collection binned also kicked out from an expensive tournament final round very publicly and embarrassingly

until recently i had a small it consulting business a domain i have had since and a google apps account using my domain today i use google apps to keep the family together under a common email suffix and to keep track of all the accounts and subscriptions i accumulated over the years i have a catchall email definition so all email coming to an undefined address ends in my mailbox there was always some abuse a couple of times spammers used a fake address on my domain as the send from address and i ended up with thousands of bounced mail and a few angry complaints i learned to live with the occasional trouble dealing with it when it comes spf also helps a lot and this is not a real issue any longer however during the past year or so a bunch of people started using fake emails on my domain for various services and social platforms for some people this is the ideal way they can open an unverified account use it but not be on the mass email lists and ubiquitous notifications coming from the vendors well in the beginning it was a single albanian guy and i just filtered him out my inaction turned out to be a mistake today there are groups that abuse my domain the ukrainians all young women the albanians who all seem to come from a single clan and the malay guys approximately people thanks to them i get dozens of daily mails from facebook microsoft skype and apple as well as hundreds of mails from the dating services ecommerce sites gaming sites and whatever they bought i was getting really pissed off and decided to fight back my first action was months ago against m a albanian guy whose name was getting daily invitations to play silly games on facebook all coming into my mailbox i searched my mailbox and found out that he is also registered to dropbox i reset his password and peeked at his files mostly boring stuff birthdays with candles and cakes some travels except for one folder where he keeps his smut collection bingo the guy loves girls with big tits and i am ok with that one picture in particular caught my fancy he took a selfie of himself during anal intercourse with a girl whose face i saw in the family pictures step was to hijack his facebook password and post the shared link the facebook account was closed after less than hours i placed m on a google delete filter action was a couple of days later o is a nice ukrainian gal in her twenties with a penchant for online dating services she had subscriptions to at least such sites plus paid subscriptions to several horoscope and psychic readings needless to say dating sites generate zillions of marketing emails or at least so it seemed to me and i really dont think highly of people who manage their lives according to the horoscope i am a one trick pony what worked for m will work for o i reset her password on dating sites and changed her description to read i like anal sex with older men preferably hairy and bald i also like dogs big dogs for a couple of weeks i would log into her dating accounts just to see urgent messages the drooling perverts sent her to be honest after the initial hysterical laughter i felt sorry for these guys not the perverts the email abusers maybe they just got bad advice from someone so i did not pursue additional revenge for a while i am not a natural jerk my domain name is similar enough to that of a hotel reservations web site and when people mistype and send to me by mistake i usually respond to them and tell them to fix their addres fast forward to may this year a newcomer starts to stand out in the crowd m this time a malay guy is a real jerk he is trying to con some people in what looks like a pyramid scheme thank you google translate for letting me understand the email content he made the fatal mistake of mixing business with pleasure and has a facebook account using his fake email well i dont have sympathy to jerks and to really stupid people who think they are really clever thank you google translate for writing obscenities in malay and thank you facebook for having low default account security measures m posted on his timeline the following text saya mempunyai pengakuan untuk membuat saya suka menghisap zakar i didnt have that much luck with a s s and r their facebook accounts are secured and require some security questions but i did change their passwords and locked them out t is another ukrainian girl living in hallifax and she uses her fake email as an apple id to buy stuff in itunes this is really stupid of her and this is the highlight of my revenge last week i erased her iphone via icloud i am getting daily requests to reset her apple id password looks like she has stuff in itunes t if you are reading this tell your friends that stealing email accounts is immoral and wrong tldr people whom i dont know abuse email accounts in my domain causing me to receive hundreds of unwanted and spam emails i retaliated by hijacking social media accounts posting on their behalf and locking them out in one case i remotely erased an iphone belonging to an abuser 
a few years ago in my mid s i was engaged to a guy obviously i thought he was worth it at the time but it turned out i was very wrong my fiance was living with me though he still maintained a studio apartment across town due to his super oldfashioned parents they were footing the bill for some of the wedding and we decided to keep them placated by keeping up the illusion of living separately one day i came home and heard the telltale sounds of people screwing my heart jumped up into my throat then plummeted into my stomach i thought there was no way it could be what i thought that it must be some porn he was watching it didnt sound like it was coming from a speaker though i crept to the bedroom and found him ballsdeep in the woman who was going to be my maid of honor in a few months i wanted to react right then but didnt trust myself in my potential reaction so i left and started to think heres where the revenge comes in i purchased a camera to hide in the bedroom and record when i was gone if he was dumb enough to have another woman in the bed in my home hed done it before and would do it again it was a matter of waiting eventually i caught them and saved the recording to multiple places physically and virtually one long weekend we were supposed to go visit his family who lived a few hours away i claimed i was sick but insisted he go while he was gone i boxed up everything of his that was at my place which was most of what he owned and brought it to a storage unit about an hour from where we lived in an area that had a couple dozen storage facilities i then put the key for the storage locker in a lockbox in another storage unit in a town an hour in the opposite direction from the starting point or two hours from where his stuff was stored i paid four months in advance for each in cash i used different names and each location i also ground off any identifying marks on the keys that would let him know what brand locks were used that done i changed the locks on my place and printed a photo of him screwing my former friend in the box with it in case that wasnt enough i included a cheap usb drive with the video on it i also put a note saying good luck finding your things finding the lock that this key fits is the first step as a final burn i sent a copy of the video to everyone we knew including his family

there is a bit of long background but its all pertinent my boss was the usual middle management guy lets call him mmg in an old contracting job tightly wound entirely focused on his subordinates mistakes while trying to flatter upper management i was under him and while most of the office feared him i was less than enthused with his leadership mmg would often make us complete several versions of the same product just in case management did not like the original product no one ever saw these ghost product versions except once when he took a part of one and passed it off as his own work added to the fact that he provided zero encouragement and had the humor of a block of wood yet when upper management was around he was a completely different person fawning and gregarious he would assume a false rapport with the staff when upper management left he couldnt care less while we didnt hate him we did greatly dislike him one instance made me want revenge i strongly argued against a untenable product feature that mmg just dreamed up mmg argued equally strongly for it it was more heated than i usually get when upper management deepsixed the feature mmg blamed the team for it and actually called me in to say that i should have been more clear in my objections and he was a bit of a screamer i was angry butim not a gotta get revenge guy so i bided my time and hoped an opportunity would arise one day the entire company has a retreat everyone is meeting with different departments and the atmosphere is chill over coronas and hacky sak i meet boss dude bd bd is a family member of the owner but perfectly competent in his own right as upper management bd headed a different department than mine so there was no office pressure we both had similar interests and became fast friends one characteristic that bd and myself shared was our affinity of pranks i told him old office pranks i used to pull before mmg and he loved it but we never talked shop and i never raised the subject of mmg nor would i have even if given the opportunity it was purely a friendfriend relationship fast forward to several months later in the interim bd asked me to assist in some pranks in his department since i was an unknown there harmless stuff mostly like pretending i was accounting and footing someone with a fake bill on their company card or helping to postit someones desk it was a nice diversion from my office of gloom and was building my prank cred at the same time i was tempted to use my influence to prank mmg but it never felt right and i thought it would end up being a mistake backfiring on me but i know there is opportunity somewhere then one day i receive an email titled significant issue from some senior guy i dont know my mouth drops when i see the photo attached in the email its a actual picture of one of our product that our team works on with a close up of the instructions that i personally write and check it reads normally until the end that says there are additional important steps for proper operation of this product however i am too drunk to write anymore so just agree to be careful ok my heart stops as the email says this went out asis in the final production despite your check we will now have to recall all the affected units care to explain i scramble to locate the file for the this product to check all its typography before i try to calculate the cost of this fup as the instructions are usually copperplate i could imagine someone adding this into the product and it missing all subsequent checks the weight of the world falls off my shoulders to see that our office put out the correct instructions without that addition i have to take a moment to catch my breath before realizing the issue i chuckle and start looking around sure enough bd is outside the plate glass looking in and laughing his ass off we go have coffee and bd explains how he coopted the design department to make a mockup of a fake instruction label to prank me with im a good sport though admittedly slightly miffed and compliment him on a solid heartattack inducing prank bd is clearly proud of his efforts a lightbulb goes on i say wow i almost died when i saw that i bet my boss mmg would have the same reaction i wheedle and flatter saying how it would be nice to reuse the prank eventually bd is supportive of trying it out on mmg even though bd doesnt personally know mmg its revenge time sowhile bd stands outside the office i write an email to mmg that is a foward of bds prank email to me sir let me first state that i am committed to solving this issue and you have my complete attention as well as my apologies in regards to this attached picture while i acknowledge this reprinting might cost our department insert large figure i think we can ameliorate these costs for the sake of our team in the near term i ask you to keep between you me senior guy who sent the first email until the team can devise a way forward i went to an air show as a boy loved it especially as those jets would scream as they flew past well a few minutes after i hit send on the email and and mmg screams in his office and that scream increases as it flies toward my cube the whole office freezes mmgs face is purplishmaroon and for a second i wonder if he is going to pass out while screaming are you a fing idiot mmg leans on my desk and starts puffing i am suddenly afraid for mmgs health and start telling him to calm down this seems to infuriate him more as he says calm down are you fing serious you add horrible insults he starts just going off about how we can do this to him finally he takes the first thing on my desk some instant coffee packet and throws it against the wall this galvanizes bd to come rushing in the room to ask mmg to calm down mmg apparently knows bd and starts gushing about how i started a crisis basically trying to put distance between me and him and gaining some sense asked me and bd to come to his office well the meeting was short for me as bd explained how the email was not only a joke but bds joke after mmg calmed down mmg tried to laugh off his behavior i apologized commiserating with mmg that the email shocked me too however i knew the damage was done at this point bd asked me to leave and bd and mmg had a short unknown discussion after a few weeks mmg was transferred and i think he eventually quit not fired bd cooled it on the pranks but afterwards seemed to be surprisedpleased how the prank magically revealed a management problem 
i was a pretty fucked up kid and to be blunt it showed had a rich boy pick on me in high school on a regular basis a bit of violence lots of intimidation the whole dance of doing everything out of view of teachers and a school system that tacitly sanctioned targeting of weird kids and me naive enough to believe that the system gave a shit about me standard high school bullshit i suppose i figured out where he lived and dumped a bottle of stupidly hot sauce da bomb final solution into his pool as expected even diluted significantly the mucous membranes of him and his family were not terribly happy found out they drained the pool without washing the walls spent a few hundred on refilling it and enough remained on the walls to force them to drain it again wash and refill i expected retaliation and kind of even hoped that id get the shit kicked out of me but but columbine happened and all the bullies across the country decided to examine their priorities for a few months 
not mine but my brothers story he was driving across the city to a friends place he was in a lane that was ending soon so flips on his turn signal checks over the shoulder and in the mirror sees a fellow a good distance back with plenty of room to spare and moves over well the other fellow didnt much care for that as hed been speeding probably kmh over like a typical bmw my car is teh fastest owner and as a result had to slow down to match my brothers over now it wasnt close or anything guy had plenty of time and room but he got right up on my brothers tail and was flashing his lights and honking his horn so theres a red light up ahead couple cars stopped in front of my brother but the other lane is open asshole jumps into the other lane but instead of pulling up to the stop line he stops next to my brother and does the roll down your window cranking motion my brother does guy starts yelling and cussing about how my brother nearly caused a massive pileup he just starts laughing at the asshole and says you had plenty of room sorry you had to slow down to only ten over super polite and all guy gets pissed rolls forward and peels out when the light turns green a bit further down the road turns a bit then climbs a hill now the cars in front of my brother had exited off so its just him and the asshole whos a good bit ahead my brother drives this road regularly and knows the police like to hide just over the hill and our city was in the middle of what they call a big ticket event where cops all put in extraspecial effort to set up speed traps and catch speeders so the asshole slows significantly for the turn and my brother having a good idea of his and his vehicles limits as well as familiarity with the road doesnt slow at all and blows past the asshole partway through making sure to smile and wave as he goes by asshole is bound and determined to show him up and prove how fast his car is so he lays into the throttle and by my brothers estimation is doing more than double the kmh speed limit when he crests the hill sure enough there are about six cop cars parked along with a couple flatdecks and my brother sees the cop standing with the radar gun walk out point at the asshole and point to the roadside last thing he sees in the rearview is guy on the side of the road just some idle speculation but around here im told that the penalty for going double the limit is automatic license suspension court date and vehicle is impounded id bet dollars to doughnuts his ohsobadass base i was languishing in the impound lot for at least a day or two and hes probably taking the bus to work

warning long and written by a potato with shitty grammar so this happened during the later stages of the s to be exact but i will not disclose the location or names of the people involved so i can stay compliant with sub rules as well as a nondisclosure clause i was made to sign after i successfully sued and won but more on that later i was working for a business run by what appeared to be a normal mom and pop type after about a month or two of working there it became apparent these mom and pop owner were in fact real shitty assholes constant belittlement ranting raving sessions for the slightest mistake and absolutely cheap to bone when it came to wages at the same time i was working two job due to shitty wages and at my other job there was a union drive happening i was just out of high school back then and did not know anything about unions and the people who were organizing this did not educate anyone they just threw a card in your face told you to sign it then left i was not actually there for the card signing i was hired just after the cards had been signed and this was still a mystery to management i literally was hired just before the shit hit the fan there where i live and at the time labor laws were set up so of the employees working at a business was all that was required to get a hearing before the labor board regarding certification when of the signed cards were received at the ministry an application for certification was faxed to the senior management at the location detailing all sorts of legal information i am not sure of all the details i do know that at that precise moment no one could be fired demoted or have their wages changed until after the hearing at the labor board where a decision would be made to accept or reject the application for certification by this point it turned into a lawyer show with lawyers from the union and business slugging it out this happens the place goes ape shit literally with middle management and union drivers in screaming matches it was fucking chaos but i was not there i was at my other job dealing with bullshit i usually dealt with with the mom and pop operation a month or two goes by and the newly organized business settle downs but there is anger resentment and hate bubbling under the surface lines are being drawn and you did not want to find yourself on the wrong side but me being a fresh faced year old out of high school and not knowing what the fuck was going on chose to side with the friendly manager who hired me after all it was him who gave me my shot not the organizers of union drive and the union organizers did nothing to educate me just threatened me with not wanting to be on the wrong side of the line when the everything was finalized if i havent lost you yet i want to take a moment to say for the record i am not antiunion i am much older now and time has given me perspective and i dont always agree with labor but i know a strong labor movement is healthy as well another debate for another time well the day comes when the pickets go up and this being a smaller town the fucking media is there as well i left my other mom and pop shitty job and came to work at the newly unionized business i was recently hired at not knowing what to do i chose to cross the picket line and go to work the results of that were to be placed in a group of socially undesirable after the pickets were down and business resumed meanwhile i continue working both jobs the mom and pop job getting more and more insufferable each day most of the workers at the union job wont talk to me and all this bullshit from both sides is really beginning to take its toll on a sensitive dumb as shit year old kid that just wanted to work smoke pot and get laid then i have an idea i am done with the mom and pop job and their fucking bullshit if a union drive can happen at the one place why not here also and i am littering giggling like a little asian girl at this idea why dont i get the same union that i crossed at my other job to unionize this place and get back in their good graces again so i call up the guy who lead the original organizing drive and after a three hour session of coffee and note pads he agrees to help me out and the next day i started to hand out cards at the mom and pop business the union business agents i dealt with could not be involved at this point legally the signing of the cards had to be done of everyones free will and it had to been brought forth by an employee not a union rep they supported me coached me daily on how i should tackle the problems that were arising but they would not show up at the business until after the application for certification was officially registered at the ministry they were adamant about this but assured me they would be there guns ready the moment it happened well i got my revenge on these petty power mad mom and pop losers the union drive took its toll on all of us but in the end i could not get enough people to sign and i was fired i called the union business agents and they told me not to worry the drive was dead but they were going to sue my former employer on my behalf what i never told the union was i always knew the union would fail it was a smaller business compared to the place where i had crossed the line the dynamics were way different and i knew the people at this business the mom and pop business really didnt give two shits either way but this was a way to legally get back at the owners of the mom and pop and clean my reputation with the union at the same time this was a small town and even know i was a dumb year old i knew this was the kind of thing that would follow me around for ever i wanted to be on the right side of the union if i ever needed them in the future so the union sued them and won i got a small settlement out of it not much moneymore satisfaction and i regained by rep with the union which helped me out many later tldr got treated like shit and cross a picket line figured out a way to get back at the people who treated me like shit and regain my rep with the union whos line crossed edit for spelling

alright small midwestern hick town bar a couple of friends and i stopped in to have a drink and watch some live music one of my friends who we call fat paul in the most affectionate way ever youd just have to be there sits down on a wrought iron bench outside the place in front of a big glass window well fat paul sat down a little too hard in the seat and it taps the window behind it a little too hard causing the window which is about oh feet tall and feet wide to shatter and drop out of the frame all over the patio on the other side of this window was a large liquor cabinet and the music was loud inside so nobody noticed while we were sitting there staring wideeyed at each other going what the fuck do we do this extremely drunk corn fed midwest bar fly comes staggering out cigarette in hand the woman is the total stereotype that youre imagining too much makeup and hairspray old saggy faded tattooed etc sounded like freakin tom waits when she talked and she had an incredibly nasty maybe even psychotic attitude to boot she comes over and asks for a lighter never noticing the window and starts making passes at us all and trying to get us to buy her a drink after a few more cigarettes the shtick started getting old and after about the fifth time of her grabbing ahold of my arm and trying to pull me into the bar i say look dude stop fucking pulling on me jesus christ im out here trying to smoke this causes a white trash nuclear meltdown this drunken dolly parton caricature starts screaming and calling us all motherfuckers and yelling at us to get the fuck out of my bar something about this shrill slurring ranting must have pierced the din better than the shattered window because the bouncer comes outside pretty quickly when he asks us what is going on the woman starts to say something and my buddy fat paul cuts her off and tells the bouncer i dunno man she came out here drunk as fuck and screaming and yelling and then she bashed out that window right there dude totally believed us called the cops and everything we went ahead and split at that point but he was pretty intent on keeping the woman there i always like to imagine she was arrested bitch haha
so back in the early days of high school i used to play a lot of xbox live and id usually play together with my friends whom i knew in real life and one guy who we only knew through the internet but were pretty good friends with anyways at first i had no problem with any of these people but after a while i couldnt help but notice how much more often that a couple of them would generally just single me out and act dickish towards me always trying to make me look stupid or an asshole and always trying to turn the group against me they mostly did this because they wanted to look cool in front of the rest of the group and thought of me as an easy target for some reason one was this kid i knew in real life but wasnt really friends with andy and the other was the kid who we only knew online dave for some reason these two were really good friends though probably because they were too insecure for real life friends after a while of silently taking their bullshit one day i finally decided id had enough and it was time to strike back the thing about andy was that he was a compulsive liar like seriously lied about the most mundane shit and would never ever admit that he was lying despite how blatantly obvious it was i think part of the reason why he didnt like me is because i would always call him out on his pathetic lies now andy had a particular lie that he always clung to which was that he had a girlfriend but that the reason we never met her was because she lived in new zealand and they were in a long distance relationship although she didnt have a phone and that they only talked through the internet it was obvious that he was lying because he could never keep his story straight and the excuses he would make when you really had him backed into a corner were just straight up laughable he even went as far as to make a fake facebook account for her with a picture he took from the internet and only had literally two facebook friends andy and dave eventually i pressured him enough about it that one day he claimed that he and his alleged girlfriend had broken up and that i could stop harassing him about it now keep in mind that andy would never admit his lies not even to his best friend dave who for some inexplicable reason was too dumb to realize he was a compulsive liar one of the reasons dave was convinced that she existed was because he talked to her on facebook a few times and hit it off pretty well when i learned this i immediately realized my opportunity and from another friend of ours i happened to get my hands on daves phone number and this is where the fun really began i sent him a text message letting him know that it was zoey the name of andys supposed exgirlfriend and that her father had finally let her get a cell phone after a bit of back of forth flirtatious texting and hitting it off we developed a romantic relationship and wed text message all the time and tell each other our secrets mine were made up of course and hed tell me all sorts of shit fully believing that we had a serious thing going on and of course andy was totally cool with it because even though he had no clue who the fuck dave was really talking to he simply could not admit that she didnt exist so he just had no choice but to go along with it too which was hilarious after a while i knew so much intimate shit about this kid and he really opened up and trusted me i even sent him dirty pics which was really just forearm by my elbow folded to look like a pussy which he really really enjoyed if you know what i mean i almost requested something from him to blackmail him with but realized that would open up a whole other can of legal trouble and i left it alone so after about a month of this while quietly taking their abuse over xbox i finally decided i had enough one day they particularly got on my nerves so in the xbox party chat in front of every one of our friends i just began reading off our intimate text messages and all the shit he told me as he slowly began to piece together what was happening dave went dead silent and turned off his xbox i then proceeded to undoubtedly prove once and for all to the rest of my friends that this girl was fake because andy was going along with it the whole time acting like she was real yet it was me therefore it was clear he was lying the whole time the best part was that it really destroyed andy and daves friendship in a way that never really healed because they couldnt trust each after andy had knowingly let dave have relations with a complete stranger i also found out from one of our mutual friends that david was so upset about it that it made him depressed and at times he couldnt even eat food it fucked with him so bad needless to say i never really had a problem with either of them trying to fuck with me after that in fact they both hated me so much that they refused to even be in the same xbox party with me ever again they could no longer truly fit in our group of friends because as long as i was playing they wouldnt and at last the problem was solved 
when i had to make up a credit in summer school i sat beside a skinny little weed dealer harmless spaceman this kid arrived at school very day with a new bruise or bump and it turned out he was being beaten by a giant and very stupid goon until he turned over his weed half way through the course i contracted a wicked case of poison ivy and the skinny spaceman asked me where i had contracted it after i told him he smiled and got this dreamy far away look in his eyes the following monday the spaceman came to school undamaged and unmussed giant stupid goon did not come at all spaceman had rolled some poison ivy into a few joints and let goon take them from him goon never came back to class and did not write the exam stone cold spaceman edit i had no idea what spaceman was planning to do and i doubt he really thought it through i never saw the goon again or spaceman after the exam this all happened in the mid s
right felt like sharing this with you guys as its kind of your forte anyway few years back i was working as a hotel receptionist we were a hotel of about rooms so roughly capacity and we just so happened to have the bulk of weddings guests staying with us needless to say we were busy and seeing as it was just us two on we manned the bar and reception they were joint one wedding had a lot of these rich smarmy silver spoon in mouths type of people they werent all dicks in their party some of them were genuinely nice interesting people who were behaving politely and well behaved it was for this reason that we kept the bar open for them anyway as the night starts to wind down people are going to bed we shut the bar people are fine with thisexcept one this one smarmy prick who wanted everyone to know his upper class status his wealth what car he drove ergh so we tell him that we will not be serving any more alcohol and that the bar is closed nope he didnt like that demands that it be left open and that he has spent loads of money to demand this the guy spent on a room and about on beer not earth shattering amounts seeing as people had spent far more than that we politely tell him to retire to his room nope again this time he squares up to my friend at this point i should note that my friend is a licensed doorman and ex military so he can handle himself my friend proceeds to tell mr high society that he will need to return to his room or vacate the hotel nope he pushes my friend i call the police as we couldnt kick the guy out of the hotel and let him wander around as the hotel was on a roundabout which was in between busy roads and it would be irresponsible the guy knowing hes fucked up just sits there all quiet whilst we wait for the police the police arrive and arrest the guy for being drunk and disorderly heres the juicy part they put the guy in the back of police car and talk to myself and my friend whilst were talking we here this strange noise over the policemans shoulder radio that noise turns into some screaming to be let out yup scared the crap out of all of us so we all turn around and posh boy is holding the in car radio screaming at the top of his voice yup police werent impressed so they cuff him and station the other officer with him they finish with us and theyre about to leave when they find the dirty bastard is laughing his head off at pissing himself on the back seat of the police car so much win because of this guy not wanting to go to bed he landing himself with an drunk and disorderly charge unsolicited use of police coms criminal damage and the cost to clean and to add icing on the cake when his friends come down the next morning to check out and ask where he is and if we checked him out already we tell them all what happened and they laughed their arses off oh and we found on the floor where he was sitting fin tldr bar shuts guy gets abusive to staff police called makes more trouble for himself by fucking with their radios pisses himself permanent criminal record public humiliation by his friends 
when i was in middle school mainly thth grade things called paper wasps were insanely popular among everybody basically all you had to do to make one was take a piece of paper and shape it in an arrow then you flung it at someone else with a rubber band they hurt like hell unfortunately since i was quite unpopular i would get attacked by these on a regular basis especially on the bus when no teacher was around the bus driver didnt do shit most of them came from a kid well call seth he sat at the back of the bus where all the popular kids sat and would always shoot them at the back of my head when i wasnt looking when i would try to confront him about it he would blame the many kids sitting in the area and continue once my head was turned starting in the middle of sixth grade this went on until my seventh grade year was nearly finished i tried everything to stop it the principal came on the bus one day to try to deter anyone from shooting them telling us that the bus driver would report anyone who shot them this helped for a few months but after a while the attacks would begin again shooting these things at me was a favorite past time among everybody and soon seth wasnt the only kid who would be doing it even though i didnt like it i had barely any friends and i sort of made myself believe that this was their way of accepting me into their circle then this happened in art class one day in seventh grade which made me believe otherwise i was minding my own business while at the same time looking at seth and his group who were huddled in one corner of the room this made me anxious because it didnt look like they were doing their project i spotted a few of them of a group of or so looking at me and laughing i figured they were planning something so i was planning on excusing myself from the class once i finished the project we werent allowed to leave the room longterm otherwise but just as i was about to turn my work in seth casually gets up which gets me more anxious and before i can react he takes out a rubber band and shoots a wasp in the worst place a guy can be hit in yup i obviously dont react lightly to this and crumple to the floor while the whole class bursts out in laughter the teacher tries to calm everyone down but even when she does this the damage is done seth and the rest of his buddies get sent out of the room and while on the floor i realize that what he hit me with wasnt paper this was a completely different material later dubbed metal wasps i forget what they actually made it from but they stung so hard that i had to keep myself from crying which would make the whole ordeal even worst because of the embarrassment i got my parents to take me home where i planned my muchneeded revenge on seth who made my school life a living hell on the way home i made my mom stop at the store where i would get the supplies for my revenge i bought dozens of rubber bands and paper along with the material that was used for the metal wasps i dont think it was actually metal though i spent the rest of the day practicing my aim and before the days end i had it unfortunately i couldnt take out my plan the very next day because seth and his cronies got suspended for three days but that meant i had plenty more time to practice when the day finally came for seths return i stuffed my bag with dozens of rubber bands and papermetal waspsall of which were intended for seth the day went on as usual but every time i would be picked on mostly by seth i would just imagine the satisfaction i would get once i had pulled this off then it finally came i admit i was nervous i never did anything this malicious before and i feared i would get in trouble but i decided it didnt matter and readied the rubber band and paper wasp turning around seth was talking to a popular eighth grade girl who well call kelly no one really noticed methey were doing their own thing but i focused on seth who was really enjoying his conversation with kelly then i fired and i got it in his eye i stared at him dumbstruck i didnt mean to get it in his eyei was actually aiming for the side of his face and then he started balling crying really hard i didnt move at all still stayed in the same position so someone eventually figured out that it was me that did it i eventually got out of my stupor and carried out my original plan firing dozens of paper and metal wasps and all of them hit seth not one of his friends stopped me laughing as he cowered from my wasps as this was going on kelly laughed along with them for a short while before going back to her friends who were all popular and paid us no attention the laughter and weeping seth was enough to annoy the bus driver and eventually i was kicked off the buss a few blocks from my stop before i walked off the bus driver said in seths defense you shouldnt pick on people who are weaker than you which made me and everyone else laugh even harder literally the whole buss cheered as i walked off the best part after the fact seth tried to get me in trouble with the school but he was ignored because they know very well that seth picked on me and im a good kid i wouldnt do a thing like that i have no idea if they tried to contact the bus driver or not but the school sided with me they thought that seth asked one of his friends who didnt side with him thankfully to do that to him he got detention for trying to get me in trouble tldr bully terrorizes me for over a year i give him a taste of his own medicine and humiliate him in front of all his friends
on a fine summers day in sleepy old melbourne i drove off from the lights at a reasonable rate fuckwit driving next to me then decides that he must be in front of me when the road turns into a single lane and cuts me off forcing me to brake sharply i did not take kindly to this i flash my lights he flips me off well played fuckwit however i also flipped him off in a spectacular display of both maturity and creativity the road then becomes two lanes at the next set of traffic lights i am in left lane fuckwit in the right the lights turn green and i floor it unsurprisingly fuckwit and his v ute take this as a direct insult to his manhood he must be faster so he goes past me but i do not give up quickly we are kmh over the speed limit of kmh approaching another intersection i quickly brake down to kmh victorious fuckwit shoots through the intersection the intersection that i knew had a fixed speed camera suck it tldr shitcunt dangerously cuts me off i get him to speed through a speed camera
i figured after my more heavy and dramatic revenge story i would post a much more lighthearted one where i actually do more than just walk away tldr down the bottom this happened a while ago but a post on the front page of reddit reminded me of it back in august i started doing my certificate iii in networking at uni the classroom was always noisy because of this particular group of classmates it happened with every teacher except the ones that wouldnt take their crap the big teacher who straight out kicked them out and well the head teacher during other classes they were really loud and annoying and this is when im trying to do my weekly tests and sometimes resitting and studying for resits since i failed the first times it was very very frustrating and difficult to concentrate anyone who has done networking will understand its a lot to take in it would happen every week every time i would mention it to the other two teachers ones response was oh but its nice to have some noise the other classes are so quiet and the other teacher was this socially awkward teacher with a lisp who didnt really do anything about it so every time toward the last quarter of these classes these annoying students would fuck around and browse whatever they want laughing about all the stuff theyre seeing and what theyre going to do after class and since im a slow learner i generally would still be doing my work and asking the teacher for assistance i had previously spoken to these annoying students but they never really listened now it pays to mention these pushover teachers are in their late s early s their hearing isnt that great and to be honest neither is mine i had discovered this application that allowed me to play really high pitch noises i even showed it to my classmates during one of my classes where everyone was discussing work so they knew i had it in reality i wasnt just showing it to them i was gauging what levels they could hear it where i couldnt i think this was around hzhz at levels they could hear it it was piercing it was playing with their heads and they really wanted me to turn it off im not as bothered by it when i hear it so i dont quite understand but i oblige an intense feeling of happiness washed over me justice was going to get served i was ready i had my nifty little gadget to get my revenge in my pocket i felt like batman skip forward a few days and were in socially awkward teachers class of course the douchebag classmates start being rowdy toward the end of the class when im still studying and getting work done while im at the class computer this is when i take out my secret weapon i turn my phone speakers up and blast the tone at hz occasionally making it go up and down by a bit to produce different pitches i then call the teacher over for help with a subject the teacher cannot hear it it was a success the most subtle type of revenge and i was doing it right in front of the teacher as the teacher is helping me i can hear the comments of the the douche classmates on the other side of the room douchebag ahh i fuckin hate that noise thing aye douchebag its so annoying douchebag fuck lets go they then left the classroom and i was left in peace to study for a few weeks i did this until i think they finally got the hint it didnt matter though once the term was over i switched classes into a class where i had people i actually liked tldr classmates are annoying to me in class when im trying to study i dont have the best hearing i find a high frequency tone generator and blast it at a tone that me and my teacher cannot hear they get angry and leave i get to study in peace end
i went to a friends house to set up his surprise going away party and a man i had only ever heard of in passing opened the door we shake hands and introduce ourselves lets call him richard upon hearing my name richard says oh right elephant youre the epileptic so you have seizures when i go like this and proceeded to flip the lights on and off now it wasnt yet dark enough and he wasnt doing it fast enough for it to actually set off a seizure but the thing about seizures is that people can literally die from them so as soon as the first moment of panic passed and i remember that i was pissed so i punched him in the face hard enough to break his nose in full view of everyone else somebody called the police but no one else there was an asshole and some of them had seen me seizing before mostly absence seizures but ive been told that those can be more terrifying to witness than tonicclonic seizures so when the police came and i made up a story about how i had had a seizure because of something richard did to try to set off a seizure they backed me up and said that i wouldnt have known what i was doing so they lectured richard and escorted both of us to the hospital edit formatting
i posted this on rpettyrevenge a long time ago from my old account at that time i dont think rprorevenge existed here is the story this happened almost years ago the year was and i was in my junior year of college there was a hate site called dalitstanorg it was an antiindiaantihindu site that contained lots of literature and posts against hindus and indians i dont remember how i came across the site but originally i just thought it was a regular discussion forum and i joined it soon i realized that the people on there were pretty much insane and so full of hatred that there was no way to convince them once they found out i was indian and hindu i started getting hate messages eventually they just banned me i then decided to harass them by creating troll accounts and spamming the board they reacted by blocking my accounts so id create a new one and restart the cycle this was getting tiring so being a cs major i decided to automate the process since this was in there was very little by way of crosssitescripting protection or captchas or any of that you could copy the code for their submission form and submit a post from a local file the first thing i did was to create a simple script that would spam the board from a single account they would ban that user and then i would create a new one they knew it was me and one of them even threatened to send a letter to my university which i laughed off because they had no idea where i was i lay low for a few days to give them false comfort and then i decided to spam them right the boards userregistration form didnt have any protection either so i wrote a script that did the following register a random username spam the message board for a random amount of time repeat this way if they blocked the user another user would start up in a little while i finished the script at around or at night so i started it up and went to bed next morning i checked their site and i found over to spam messages on their message board they were freaking out and talking about being hacked they had also blocked all posts to the forum except for a few users and had started cleaning up the spam after they cleaned it up they cautiously opened up posting to all users again i didnt bother them for a week and they thought they were in the clear then bam i started up the script again this time i had multiple instances of the script running so up to bots were posting at the same time the next morning there were around posts in all of their sub forums the forum was pretty much unusable they couldnt even post because every legitimate new post would be drowned out by the spam posts they then made the forum inviteonly but there was still a shit ton of spam to clean up i checked in on the site from time to time to find it pretty much dead they were still trying to clean up the spam and there were no new users or posters since it was inviteonly they never quite recovered and after a week or two the site went down i like to think that i had something to do with that tldr i stumble across a forum i start posting only to discover that they are racist fucktards i get banned i use my lt haxr skills to spam them into oblivion site never recovers and goes dark

amazing story a good friend just posted about bonding with her father my father is a shy and quiet man growing up he and i werent close he didnt quite understand my overly dramatic responses to everything we didnt connect on any level the only time he generally spoke to me was when he was angry with me because i was arguing with my mom however when i was i was able to form a special secret bond with my father we did a very bad thing and then kept the secret from my mother and in my mind the authorities this secret which will now no longer be a secret has bonded us together ever since to this day we still talk about the time when we practically broke the law my dad still beams with pride as if it was his crowning moment its a story i treasure because its ours sunday was obligatory church day in our house my mother taught sunday school my brother attended sunday school i sang in the childrens choir and my dad was a deacon or some such ranking official after church my mother would stay in town and pick up greeting cards at the hallmark store or refill prescriptions on this particular sunday my parents had driven separately to church so my father wouldnt have to partake in card shopping my brother was going with my mom i weighed my options and decided to forego shopping and hopped in my fathers pickup truck we have to stop off at the shop my father said my father was the owner and operator of the towns only garbage removal company wasteaway disposal service a refuse you cant offer we didnt have cityfunded garbage service in our tiny village and my father had trucks employees a shopgarage offices and he also managed the city dump as a child i was always embarrassed of his work kids would pick on me about being a garbage picker or always having enough to eat later in life i would come to appreciate the financial benefits to being the daughter of a garbage picker and have since been quite proud of my fathers business as we pulled up to the shop i noticed two garbage trucks parked in front of the garage my dad immediately started swearing that fucking son of a bitch im god damned tired of his bullshit hes stealing from me seven fucking dollars a month and hes stealing from me god damned son of a bitch emily get in the god damned garbage truck this was probably more words than my father had ever spoken to me and the first time id heard him say the f word i was alarmed as i climbed in the garbage truck my father explained an angry guy who lived around the corner refused to pay his garbage bill and had gotten upset with my father about the fee of a month for garbage service after some yelling he promptly cancelled his service with my father then the guy started sneaking his garbage over to the shop at night and throwing it in the back of the garbage trucks that werent parked inside he was in fact stealing from my father my father continued on to say the guy wasnt terribly smart as he always threw away his mail with his name and address and was easily identified as we pulled up he had noticed new garbage thrown in the back of the truck not compressed including letters and magazines ive had conversations with that guy about throwing his garbage in here i told him i was going to take him to court if he didnt quit i didnt know what was going on but i was quite afraid of how angry my dad was id never seen that part of him before i thought maybe we were going to drive over to the guys house and fight him i was truly scared of what might happen because i didnt consider my dad a good fighter he was too shy and nice my dad backed the full garbage truck onto the street and turned the corner we soon pulled up to a ranch style home with a sizeable front yard i could only assume this was angry guys house but i was still completely unsure what my dad had in mind instead of pulling into the driveway my father swore a few more times and backed the garbage truck through the front yard stopping precisely at the moment the back of the truck touched the cement set of porch stairs there were deep tire tracks in the grass and mud troughs had formed where grass once grew crime destruction of property i was only able to observe what was going on outside through the side mirror but from inside the truck i noticed my father pushing buttons and pulling levers then i realized what was happening my father was dumping the entire garbage truck filled with trash onto the mans front steps and porch this was all the trash that truck had picked up and compacted in a day this was much much more than angry mans trash it was half the towns trash as we pulled away my father exclaimed i bet he doesnt dump his garbage in my trucks again i looked back as we drove off to see a mountain and a half of garbage propped perfectly in front of the house piled high on the cement patio the wrought iron railing held it all neatly in place and the front door was no longer visible behind the wall of refuse crime littering crime front yard invasion i kept imagining angry guy walking out his front door in his bathrobe blearyeyed and searching for his sunday paper only to find a mountain of trash he would have no way of removing i imagined him taking a few seconds to realize who had done the deed and then calling the police to have us arrested my dad just smiled i think he was imagining the man in his bathrobe standing in a pile of garbage too then in typical fatherform my father said dont tell your mother that was probably illegal in that instant i knew i was special my dad trusted me with his illegal activities and now i had something in common with him a connection id never had before although i was somewhat horrified of the whole incident i was excited to have something to talk about with my dad when i visited him in jail i also was secretly proud that my dad was such a badass we quickly drove back to the shop and got into my dads pickup and headed home i was speechless and my father was too busy beaming to say a word when we arrived minutes later i didnt look my mother in the eye i feared she would see the crimes written in my pupils i knew the police would soon be taking me away based on what i had learned about jail from tv i determined i was an accomplice id most likely be going to jail for years and my father would certainly get life i tried not to cry as i sat on the couch searching out the window waiting for the police to come i was afraid for weeks always fearful when a car pulled down our street the police never came and my father and i kept our secret one day years later he told me the guy started coming to the dump religiously after that and paid to dump his trash there instead he never said a word to my dad about the mountain of trash and apparently no witnesses ever put me at the scene of the crime now every time i bring up that story my dad laughs so hard he cries hes still so proud of the day he took down the man who stole from him he always finishes the story with he never did dump his trash in my trucks again then he always says between tears i guess we really did have a refuse he couldnt offer i never did understand that slogan but i too laugh until i cry just the same 
i think this deserves to be here because this revenge took an epic years to exact for context i moved across the world when i was in my country of original citizenship i started a year early and skipped a grade so if i had continued along this path i would be graduating high school at the age of i moved to australia and because i had almost finished th grade but i was young i was told i needed to be evaluated to check my competency fair enough i guess my family expected as much what we didnt expect however was the school counselor he evaluated me asked some questions and then spoke to my mother afterwards he decided that i should be put into th grade which was just starting due to start date of the school year even though i was about halfway through th grade i believe his exact words were spaghetti is very eloquent which makes him appear more intelligent than he actually is pretty crushing thing for a year old to hear you arent actually that smart you just sound smart so here goes mate im going to prove you as wrong as i possibly can im going to be the best damn th grader youve ever seen in yo life fast forward to senior year of high school and its college application time ive been invited into several extended programs and as a result ive finished two semesters of university mathematics and one of physics this counselor meets with all students individually to discuss college plans or lack thereof so he knew i was looking into international programs specifically cambridge yale and harvard several weeks after our initial meeting he approaches me about a program thats being established in the middle east american campuses expanding into international waters the school had been invited to nominate a student and he had chosen me because of my stellar grades tenacity and motivation to explore different options my mother and i were invited in to discuss this possibility after i realized i was going to apply i had already written my essays and needed to discuss some logistics as a nominated student him signing off as the nominator references from faculty etc i will never forget the expression on his face when my mum asked him if he remembered the last time they had met i remember you she said we met about years ago do you recall what you said about spaghetti he shakes his head oh you told me he was eloquent and appeared smart but wasnt actually that smart isnt it funny that youre nominating him for this now ringing dead silence and he goes bright red for the record i was accepted to the program a liberal arts college with a sub acceptance rate and im lucky enough to study and live all over the world spaghetti counselor the best revenge is massive success frank sinatra
this story happened a while back when i was in uni back then i was studying overseas and lived with my brother who had a drivers license and a car we both went to the same school so i regularly hitched rides from him the uni has a whole car park dedicated for students however as we both attend the largest faculty we usually had to arrive early for a spot or you would just end up circling for an eternity trying to find one one morning we arrived fairly close to our lecture time and were desperately trying to find a park we eventually spotted someone pulling out of a lot and we signalled our parking intentions and waited behind the lot as the car pulled out and engaged the drive gear this fucking prick takes advantage of the fact the driver was heading in our direction and zips into the lot as we had to wait for the original driver to driver off incensed we let rip with the horn and told him exactly what we thought of his behaviour this prick then proceeds to exit his car grinning at us before flipping the bird and dashing off to class extremely pissed and running late we had no choice but to circle the carpark again and pray we got lucky and you know what we did get lucky we found a spot within a minute and decided that this fucking prick was going to pay so my brother and i headed back to the pricks car with revenge on our minds now the pricks car was an old bomb which probably meant that he didnt have a lot of money this is important because we figured that if we let out all the air in his tyres he wouldnt have the means to tow it somewhere to get the air pumped back in thus with my brother acting as a look out i slowly deflated all the air in all four tyres rendering me late for class but grinning like a fool as a entered my lecturer was not impressed i left uni that day and forgot about the incident until the end of the week when i next had class as me and my brother arrived we saw that the pricks car was still there in the same lot this made me burst out laughing and i gave my brother a quick fist bump creating an impromptu tradition each time we saw his car this carried on for the entire month as the pricks car started to collect parking tickets and was eventually presumably towed away it was the most satisfying revenge i ever had

an old story of mine i used to go to a public high school where the majority of students were low to middle class italian origin kids of immigrants tough going to say the least when i was in high school i used to get bullied by a guy called renaldo we had a few scraps either verbally or fisticuffs over the years i was always the type of guy who wouldnt take other peoples shit and while others balked at giving me a hard time particularly when i went through puberty and became one of the tallest largest guys in school he somehow always managed to give me a hard time it was a tough time but in a way i paid my dues early and learnt from a stern father that if people punched you you punch back and you punch harder and youll know if they are men or not as luck would have me renaldo ended up in the same college i went to and he always managed to somehow someway be a little shit to me what made things worse is that we fell for the same girl andrea who eventually became my girlfriend of over years everyone knew he had feelings for her and that it killed him she was with me and not him he always tried to seduce her with random calls and emails being the son of a wealthy father who owned his own construction company that he had nice cars lots of money a bunch of shit that i didnt have and over the years worked hard to earn coming from a low income family that was having problems making ends meet he was a constant issue the first year of my relationship and we had several conflicts years later after college and shortly after i broke up with andrea i received an email from him out of the blue i never corresponded with him facebook didnt exist back then and he went out and told me in an epic letter which went far too long swore at me in excess and used terrible english no wonder he never finished college and dropped out to work with daddy basically it was a no one liked me in college and to f off i havent seen him in well over years nor did we have any real friends in common as a way of keeping my cool nor did i want him to have the satisfaction to get me mad i never responded to his emails he sent several however i couldnt let his taunting go without consequences so i went online and googled his name after searching around a bit i easily found a complete profile of him regarding his career where he worked and what type of work it was his father passed away recently and he now owned his fathers business and had a team of employees working for him i spied a bit more and hung onto the address of his place of employment for several weeks while i plotted one day i proceeded to go into a local sex shop and i purchased the largest fattest floppiest black dildo that i could find along with some ky and i went home wrote a special note for him and put it along with the big fat black dildo and ky and boxed it in a standard box that couldnt be traced back to me and sent it priority mail that required for him specifically to sign the note read since you have so much time to search out people that never gave a shit about you to begin with i figured youd have enough time to go fuck yourself with this one of our mutual acquaintances dropped me an email a few days later this acquaintance worked for renaldo during his internship and apparently the package arrived while they were preparing to head out for a team lunch on a friday and he was very excited to get the box opened since renaldo thought it was something he ordered online that he was expecting and would make it a good weekend and he opened it in front of a number of coworkers and instead of whatever he ordered he pulls outa giant black floppy dildo priceless

early winter dallas texas am my senior year of high school i had a free period in the morning allowing me to arrive at school a full class period later than everyone else this particular day it was pouring rain the streets were backed up and i was running late i got to school around the time i needed to be in attendance at my first class being late i knew that most of the choice parking spots would be occupied and i would have to walk a little way further than usual this wouldnt normally be a problem my teacher was cool and didnt mind if people showed up a few minutes late except that it was pouring rain and i had important paper assignments to carry inside i pull into the lot and there it was the holy grail there is an open spot right up against the school i could park there and run under the lip of the roof and get to the front door with nothing wet but my shoes as i neared the parking space i saw the car a late model audithe lowest echelon of german auto making occupying not one but two parking spaces this was no accident he was not parked a few inches over the line he was parked directly on top of it normally i would deal with this in a sensible passiveaggressive manner by squeezing myself into the space to the left of him leaving only inches between my car and his driverside door but the school parking spaces were narrow and i drove a large american sedan instead i was forced to circle the lot until i found the only unoccupied space a good yards from the building i tucked my papers under my shirt but the downpour was too intense and they were soaked along with my clothes hair shoes socks and pride as i passed the douchemobile on my way towards the building i was overcome with rage his windshield wipers were of the variety that slide easily on and off the hinges so i pulled them off and dropped them down a nearby storm drain if i had to walk to class in the rain he would have to drive home blinded by it
background this was a snobby high class apartment community in the southern california orange curtain filled with residents and managers who think every problem is balanced by money and anyone else contractor service employee or other was below them and expendable as the security contractor we were expendable and they made it clear because we were hired to replace the previous contractor that we found out were set up to fail by the same managers that hired us we werent hired to provide security so much as for the company to have someone to blame as their liability shield if something went wrong the conflict among the many residents thinking that their high rent entitled them to the right to complain about anything they wanted was one that we will refer to as he would call in and complain at any hour he wanted most commonly minutes from pm when the pools closed to complain about people in the pool or to tell us how to do our job the pools close at pm and most of the time he called before that just to say we needed to close them he would complain we werent doing out job didnt do out job he couldnt sleep because a neighbor was screwing too loudly all sorts of ridiculous things he also left his window open which was probably why he supposedly could hear everything and later became his achilles heel the property managers offered to move him to a different apartment but he refused because of his view of the pools on the top floor and the managers would always settle because he paid a really high rent anyways after over a year of this we retaliated conflict resolutionrevenge the previous month had called in times a day every day so i told the other security guards to pee in a bucket or contribute something virile and liquefied to the gag bag every time he called and it would be put to good use after days we had enough i was still in college as an engineering major at the time and after enough fluid mechanics and hydraulic lab work i had designed a prototype revenge machine basically a giant supersoaker with a nozzle powered by compressed gas i used a propane tank because it was convenient as security guards we had access to the roof and i already had a vantage point in mind for i had a previously calculated set of tables to make the perfect shot a little bit of trigonometry and a partner to help set up the shot and with the pull of the trigger we sent over a gallon of piss fish guts yellow dye and left over indian food through the window and onto their rug without even grazing the window edges all while under the cover of night apparently didnt have any idea what had happened the following morning complaining got them nowhere but they got pegged with the cleaning fine because couldnt prove they didnt make the mess themselves and they were at home at the time which was even more surprising they did not hear a splash after all the noise complaints they made that year tldr guy complains too much too long to security guard security guard uses engineering makes giant putrid filled supersoaker guy gets fined for cleaning mysterious stinky yellowish stain on rug edit for those asking more about the bad baby super soaker device the closest existing commercially available water gun i can think of to what i used would be the stream machine if you can imagine a preassurized gas chamber behind the plunger it also had a main spring in the gas chamber connected to the media divider behind the fluid reservoir but it didnt actually contribute force but assisted the assemble of the device this actually wasnt the first time i fired this contraption before just the first time i used the equipment off campus off record and using a fluid that wasnt entirely water the first time i tried it on a grass lawn on campus i didnt take into account the recoil impulse momentum principle sum of forces pqv and the bad baby ended up recoiling backwards and shot some of us in the back of the knee with the stream of water this problem was solved by standing on the mounting plate also this contraption was originally part of a lab experiment and occasionally used to encourage prospective students to enroll in engineering thankfully the jet nozzle at the end of the tube was enough to keep the flow laminar but there was a system of about parallel straws each long at the end of the chamber just before the shut off valve before the nozzle similar but not the same as a firemans hose these straws also had the double feature of stopping the plunger before it hit the end of the chamber like a shock absorber if the shut off valve was left on before the chamber emptied it also means that there was about liter of fluid left in the straw and nozzle for those asking why we felt deserved the wrath of the bad baby it wasnt just his calling in and complaining he was telling us how to do our job and how to solve problems before they were even a problem on a neurotic scale he often did make phony calls to us about a trespasser in the pool area while we were already watching it this is one of the most selfish things you can do to call security attention to a knowingly false problem and forcing us to leave other areas vulnerable if we were law enforcement he wouldve been cited for harassment or false reporting and we werent the only people troubled by the management and other residents had growing problems as well management would not act because of money and his making enemies made it harder for him to think of a suspect he also had a bad habit of smoking off the balcony and raining ashes onto the cabana area below which we witnesses and did eventually cause comparable level of property damage but money meant more to the management also last i checked years after this incident and he was still making the same bs calls and complaints and still refused to move to another apartment clearly bitching was his hobby and for the people asking about the distance we used a triangle to measure the shot hypotenus props for the literal revenge machine

this happened about years ago when i was still in high school i used to work at a restaurant as a bus boy one particular night a man came in by himself and ordered a pizza and appetizer and a few beers nothing weird about him but it was a slow night and i distinctly remember him because im fairly certain he had come in to dine before he ate his food and left i cleaned the table after he left and as soon as i was finished the waitress who had his table asked me if i accidentally threw his bill and money away now at this point i had been working at the restaurant for years and i always check to make sure there isnt any money or credit card receipt on the table before i throw anything away well the guy had left without paying yeah it sucks and yes the waitress got stiffed on a mediocre tip but it sucks knowing that we probably would never catch the guy because who is dumb enough to come back to a restaurant in which you previously dined and dashed well fast forward weeks its another slow night and i notice a familiar face walk in the door hes by himself and one of the waitresses sits him at a booth now i know for sure that this is the same guy that was in the restaurant weeks prior that left without paying i asked the waitress what he ordered and it was an appetizer and a pizza i told the owner that this guy was the same guy that stiffed the restaurant weeks ago the owner pulled up that old receipt and it was identical to what the guy had just ordered one of the pizza cooks was pretty ghetto looking he had lots of tattoos up and down his arms and had a general mean look on his face most of the time he was actually a very nice guy so the owner told him to go stand by the door in case the guy tried to leave without paying the pizza cook also made a point to not break eye contact with the customer at this point everyone working knew what was going on so occasionally other employees would come to the dining room floor and take a peek at the guy the guy started noticing that the employees were looking at him and he became obviously uncomfortable the manager went to his table and explained that his food was ready but he would have to pay his bill before he received his food she didnt mention his other unpaid bill yet he then requested that his order be to go the manager went back and packed up his food meanwhile the guy got up to use the bathroom once he walked toward the bathroom the pizza cook watching the door left his post to go talk to the manager about what was going on the guy saw his opportunity and booked it out of the restaurant the manager and i both saw him leave so she ran out after the guy she caught up to him pretty quick and asked why he left and that he didnt pay his bill he tried to play dumb and said really i thought i left money at the table the manager told him no you didnt pay and you also didnt pay for your meal last time you were here he then said well i only live a few blocks away i was just running home to go get money to pay for my food the manager brought the guy back in and sat him down at the bar then proceeded to call the police the cops showed up a few minutes later and asked the guy why he didnt pay this time or last time the guy exercised his right to remain silent and was put in hand cuffs and walked out of the restaurant into the back seat of the police car all while the employees and the few customers that were present were all clapping loudly the guy never came back after that tldr guy leaves restaurant without paying comes back weeks later and tries to do the same thing gets caught and arrested
at an old apartment complex i used to live in i was in a unit on the top floor the walls are rather soundproof but the ceilings and floors dampened most sound unless you accidentally drop something really listen honestly if you really strain you could hear the television show the people downstairs were watching but floorsceilings were never as soundproof as walls in this complex most downstairs neighbors i had in the years i lived there never complained until i had one that did first complaint i had was in the form of a letter from my front office claiming loud video game noises and that i had a dogi had neither a console or a dog at this time and that i had to remove the dog and stop playing the console or be evicted and this was my first of two warnings or strikes on my lease i walked right over to the office pointed out since the notice was inside my unit if they saw a console or evidence of a dog woman at the front office conceded i was right and removed the warning from my file a week later i had a note on my door from downstairs complaining about noise i went down and knocked on the door neighbor didnt bother to answer later on that same week as i was in bed reading no radio or television on i had a cop knocking on my door for a noise complaint i invited the officer in he looked around agreed with me that there was no way any noise was coming from my unit same cop came back twice his last visit he said that he was fed up he agreed that i was doing nothing wrong and that the police will no longer be entertaining any noise complaint reports from my downstairs neighbor he also said the complex told him the same thing next day i found my shoes suddenly felt very very heavy get home gotta make sure theres no dirt stomp stomp stomp cooking need to mince garlic why mince lets pulverize with a hammer wham wham wham hmm ya know this television show could use more bass i heard beating on my floor screaming shouting police never came office never bothered me about it 
i just discovered this subreddit today and am thoroughly enjoying reading all the prorevenge storys and thought id share mine anyway getting on with my story this all happened the summer of my sophomore year of high school and the end of my junior year so im walking with my girlfriend at the time and a few of our friends back to my house from our local park in the middle of summer vacation the neighborhood the park is in doesnt have sidewalks so were walking in the street casually moving out the way as cars need to get past until this k blazer incase your unfamiliar with them k blazers are basically suvs where u can take the top off and be left with what i consider a pick up truck with seats in the bed with this obnoxious custom paint job is behind us we move to the side thinking nothing of it until they slowly pull up besides us and guys with squirt guns spray us with god knows whatme and friends decided we would be better of just not pondering thatthey then speed off while some of my friends throw rocks and yell and i try to calm down my now crying girlfriend fast forward a couple months after school has started againi realize the dbags that sprayed us goes to the same school as us after see the obnoxious blazer in the student parking lot and decide to start to hatch a plan for revenge i wait out the rest of the school year till weeks before our last day of school and its now sufficiently warm for my plani go to the grocery store buy dozen eggs and gallons of milk and let them sit outside and ferment in the heat so everything was nice and rancid and disgusting perfect to use for revenge for what they had done last year last day of school i skipped my st class of the day and what i had thought would be the hardest part of this was actually fairly simple because the dbags left there window down allowing for easy access to the blazer so i artfully plaster the insides of the truck with the rotten eggs and then poured the milk all over the seats and floor making sure to get some on the steering wheel walked down the street to ditch the evidence at a nearby convenience store trashcan and went to my nd class to let my revenge ferment some more till the end of the day when i gathered all of friends so we can see there reactions and they were indeed priceless well worth waiting the entire school year to act on my plan the owner of the truck opened the door stared inside and then flipped out while everyone coming out of the school stared and the owners friends trying to help scoop out the chunks of milk and egg in disgust so satisfying morel of the story revenge is best served after fermenting in the sun for weeks also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes its like am and i have not slept yet
i was not especially mean when i was younger but when called upon to chime in i could be a little bitch i went to highschool in a small town in the midwest and my sophmore history teacher mrs smythe had a son who was a senior and stood behind me in choir im incredibly ashamed to admit what i said about her because this woman was one of the kindest most intelligent and supportive teachers i ever had and she was close to lbs on a very petite frame this lady had to use a scooter and elevators meant for injured students to traverse the campus just to give you an idea of how the weight impacted her life so i was just bitchassing with some friends in the cafeteria and they started in on just how incredibly fat mrs smythe was and many many sophomoric comments were thrown about i wasnt really engaged in what they were saying for the first part but then someone said something about how many people could be fed if she were cut up for meat on a deserted island i made some pithy remark about how one of her thighs was the perfect shape and weight of thanksgiving turkey which for some dumb reason broke everyone up and my comment was passed along to mrs smythes son sometime in the following week i heard smythe jr was justifiably pissed about what i had said but he didnt really do anything other than give me the stink eye from time to time so i thought thats all there was to it i dont know what it was that made him choose this particular day to play arson but i think he was probably stewing over it for a while and finally decided to take revenge i was standing in front of him in choir and i kept feeling some weird woosh on the back of my neck like someone was blowing on it i was wearing an old black nike track jacket with white piping that was popular c it was probably polyester and rayon or some shit but flammable and meltable smythe jr was using a cigarette lighter to slowly melt the back of my jacket because the material didnt catch fire for very long like fabric but melted like plastic i began to smell a very odd burning scent and turned around to see little smythe casually toss a lighter down through the risers we were on into the abandoned orchestra pit below unrecoverable the entire back of my jacket had burned up to my shoulder blades and was merged with my shirt underneath when everyone realized what was happening they were all hysterical with laughter cause if i wanted to have a clothed upper body for the rest of the day i was going to have to walk around looking like a train crash survivor moral dont talk shit cause it will always come back around to give you light chemical burns spelling edits
tldr bully hits me from rdto th grade i start my longterm revenge in th grade culminating in a short fight and a bloody nose some backstory i was born in korea moved to the southern us until the beginning of rd grade and moved to the northeast for rd grade onwards the school i attended in the south was a more or less a sanctuary educators loved their children and confrontation rarely occurred between kids so when i learned i would move to a different place it was extremely hard for me to handle assimilating myself into the new school in the north wasnt easy primarily because none of my classmates wanted to spend time with me or associate with me this is how i spent most of my elementary to middle school years the schools in my area were all elementary middle schools put together however there was one chinese boy who showed interest in me and we started a tentative relationship unfortunately this child was kind of an angry child and having no one else to take out his anger on often acted physically violent towards me it started off as simple pushing shoving and taking balls away at recess it progressed through tripping into holding me down and then into kicking me in the legs and punching my stomach of course i told many teachers and other staff members about what was happening unfortunately nothing got fixed because theres only so much teachers can do when an angry chinese lady is screaming about how her son is sensitive and that i was the problem child i had to sit through that meeting i actually so uncomfortable that i asked my principal if i could be excused to go home by th grade this bullying had peaked at one moment where we were in art class finishing up our pottery that we had been working on we had just finished glazing them and were getting ready to paint he comes to sit with me to paint and before i can get a brush in my hand he picks up my jar about fistsized and proceeds to swing it and connect with my jaw he then opens the window and throws it outside unbroken but chipped our art teacher was an africanamerican man in his late s at that time and he wasnt having any of it he yelled at the chinese boy sent him to the principals office and sat down with me in the corner of the room i dont recall crying but im sure i was and ill never forget what he said in his soft voice he told me that hed been seeing this happen to me and none of the other kids intervene he told me that i would have to take my stand and make sure that kid never even comes close to thinking about coming after me again i understood this wasnt something to tell other teachers about or my parents my revenge started off quietly his missing paintings were found in the art sink a complete goopy mess his recorder bought with parent money used in music time was filled with glue his homework would end up missing he got zeros for the assignment oops his backpack once ended up turtled filled with pinecones and wet leaves while his books and pencils ended up halfburied in dirt i noticed that he progressively got more frustrated with what was happening that he started to redirect his anger towards me so the beginning of the school year in th grade he came over during recess to push me over step on me etc he never got a chance to the second he came over i threw a ball at point blank range at his face it connected and threw him off his balance regaining his balance he tried to retaliate by kicking his foot connects with my shin while my tiny fist connects with his nose i had never seen so much blood come out of one orifice of the human body to this day i havent seen that much blood in one place since the great blood exodus from the chinese boys nose he starts crying teachers whisk us to the principals office conveniently located next to the nurses office i tell our principal that he got what he deserved because i put all the hurt he gave me since rd grade into one big punch i was sent home but not suspended parents not angry but worried about me and what would come of it chinese mother calls my parents to make me apologize my dad takes the receiver out of my moms hand and hangs up on her i went back to school the next day but the chinese boy didnt when he finally did return after a few days he still had a swollen nose he didnt talk to me or interact with me for the rest of our middleschool time together and he moved on to a different high school 
so when i was younger and living at home my parents got me to do chores which was no big deal except i really hated mowing the grass because i essentially felt like crap for the next hours this is despite my doctor warning my parents of my allergies and urging them to not to let me do it or let me be outside while its being mowed but my parents still make me do it and i have to grit my teeth and sneeze my way around the yard one day my parents leave to go for a walk with my sister im kinda ticked because i would much rather be going for a walk than to sneeze my brains out mowing grass so as i finish up mowing the yard just as they come back with ice cream in hand none for me apparently they now are going to go to the mall and do some shopping and offer for me to come along i ask if they would wait for me to have a shower and possibly stop for ice cream so i could have some too nope they cant wait for me to have a shower and they wouldnt stop for ice cream anyways so they leave me behind again i pull out the fertilizer spreader and large bag of fertilizer i know approximately th of a bag is the usual amount i am told to use for our size of yard so i load the rest of the bag about of it into the spreader and proceed to spread fertilize in the yard i then found the round up plant killer and loaded that up in our sprayer this is the stuff that we used to kill grass around the shed and around the deck to stop the grass from growing i sprayed an even light coat through the middle of the yard guess who didnt have to mow the grass for the rest of the year our grass was like straw for the rest of the summer and even the next year it grew back very thin tldr i was allergic to grass parents made me mow the yard even though doctors said i was too allergic one day my parents take my sister to get ice cream and go to the mall without me so i get revenge by over fertilizing and spraying plant grass killer through the yard edit fixed derpy grammarspelling added note i was or when i did this i know very well how immature i was at that age thanks for letting me know
this i can attribute to a coworker when he quit several years ago at my old job he was for the most part a malingering useless kid not worthy of any job that wasnt menial he eventually quit in search of better employment and thats when it happened he had been there for years without promotion and decided it was time the owner and his wife were crotchety old fucks who treated many of the staff like shit personal servants to do their bidding at their small mechanical company when lets call him rick quit they decided to ride his ass because that was their mo treat you like shit normally quit make sure you know youre a piece of shit they laid into rick ever chance they got being the company gopher he was all over the place doing different tasks and could often be unsupervised for lengths of time they should have known better and either paid him out or had him do supervised work for his last weeks we had a problem on a hot summer friday around am the sewers in the main building were backing up the main drain in the shop wasnt draining and neither were the toilets or the sinks everyone was annoyed one of the guys in the tool shop came over to the main building to complain that the same thing was going on there too main drains toilets etc all backing up shit was actually backing up onto the floors they call a plumber to come out and bring a vac truck too after a few hours of work they get us up and running again next week the same damn thing happens again shit backing up everywhere call the plumber again they roll out to get us going again different crew this time the guy tells us we have a bigger problem with the sewage lines and need to call the city we get a crew from the city the next day they come out with snakes and cameras the problem is bigger than they figured major blockage gonna need to dig up the lines and do some major work two days later a twelve man crew including a fucking backhoe and they start digging they dig through asphalt to get town to the lines the big boss is out there acting like hes awesome and inspecting all the work as they go the foreman informs the boss that there is a piece of plastic stuck in the pipes but thats only at the head of the blockage what it was trapping in place was reams and reams of paper towel shit and other sewage i mean more paper towel that is in stock at costco is stuck in there the boss losses his mind its the fucking staff what happened rick had enough he would disappear and for min each day he was flushing roll after roll of paper towel down the drain hed been at if for months edit tldr disgruntled employee flushes untold amounts of paper towel down the drain leading to a sewer blockage followed by shit flooding and eventual sewage line excavation costing thousands probably thousand of work to the city all bc the boss treated him like a piece of shit for a couple years
about years ago i was working a summer job as a lifeguard at a beach a few hours from my home town i moved out of the awful employee housing when i got lucky and found a little house bedroom bathroom with a loft for the low low cost of month now to keep the costs down after the first month i rented some space to a three other lifeguards a college age bulgarian girl who was super nice and a great roommate and a set of year old twins from ohio or something who were two of the worst people i have ever met the loft is by far the largest room in the house literally covering the entire footprint of the building so i take that as my bedroom the bulgarian gets the other bedroom and the twins get the couches in the living room they did your run of the mill roommate bs paying rent late stealing food leaving food out until our kitchen was overrun with cockroaches i also have reason to believe that they staged a break in and stole laptops and cameras from the bulgarian and i but this goes far beyond that they were really shitty people i routinely found myself preventing them from doing what could only be called date rape or just plain rape they would brag about getting girls drunk fucking them then stealing moneyphoneswhatever out of the girls purses real scumbag stuff there was a lifeguard party at another house and one of the twins got caught in a back room with his hand up a passed out girls skirt and would have gotten beat down for it if he hadnt ran out the back door the other twin decided to fight one of my friends in my front yard i stepped in to break up the fight and was pushing my friend in to my car when the twin saw an opportunity to punch me in the back of my head when i wasnt looking i really regret driving my friend home instead of beating this kid down for the sucker punch but i honestly think he did more damage to his own knuckles than to me so im stuck with these two for the summer and that sucks balls but im making the best of it specifically im charging the twins each a month for rent for the two living room couches and the bulgarian pays me for a private room the twins cover rent the bulgarian covers electric and the leftovers go in my pocket the only downside is that i have to play landlord to all three before you judge me realize that they were still getting a pretty good deal living with me this house is two blocks from the ocean and on average rooms are going for also i was the only one with my name on the lease so i was assuming any liability anyway the summer drags on all my friends go back to school and at this point its a few random stragglers the twins and myself working the beach in the postseason there is a small community college just down the road from the beach so at the end of the season there is an influx of freshman girls out on the beach tanning the twins egos are at an all time high after getting heaps of phone numbers from naive children and they decide they want to throw a party being the only one over they ask me to get a keg i agree but under the condition that they pay for the keg deposit and tap the night of the party comes and they are keen to tap the keg but i convince them to hold off until all the girls they invited start showing up it turned out pretty much exactly as i expected not one person showed up not even free beer could get people to hang out with these kids we clear out the fridge and put the keg in it so it will be cold tomorrow night when people come over i wake up the next morning for my day off and the twins head off to work halfway through my morning routine i start thinking about all the bullshit these kids have pulled over the course of the summer and i come up with a plan i call up my supervisor at the lifeguard agency we talk for while and agree that they dont have any real need for me until next summer i walk across the street to my landlords house and tell him that ill be leaving a week early and ask him if he could come inspect the house for my security deposit before i leave my landlord shows up just as i finish packing all my stuff into my car he checks out the house and gives me my deposit back in cash i tell him the twins are staying and that any future rent or damage will be their responsibility hes a pretty laid back guy so he agrees hes about to leave when i say hey man can you help me out with something i tell him about the twins failed party and suggest that a keg of beer is far more than they know what to do with he has a good laugh and the two of us unload the keg from the fridge and load it into my trunk there were a couple cases of beer as well i give those to my landlord for his help im just about to leave for good when i notice an opportunity for a cherry on top there is one lone coronita one of those miniature coronas they put in margaritas sitting unopened on the counter i take it and carefully put it in the empty fridge right where the keg used to be cant leave the twins completely empty handed i lock my old house for the last time give my key to the landlord and start calling my friends in my home town to tell them that we are having a kegger two hours into my ride home i get a call from one of the twins he went through all five stages of grief during our short conversation denial you didnt take the keg did you anger you stole our keg motherfucker ill kick your ass bargaining bring back our keg or ill call the cops good luck dickhead the deposit is in my name depression we are having girls over tonight how will we be able to fuck them without alcohol and finally acceptance fuck you keep it a few hours later im drinking to victory with my home town friends tldr lived with a couple of scumbags for the summer got free beer 
 my dad was a great guy pretty laid back but sharpwitted with professionallevel ballbuster skills he took everything in stride until you crossed him this is a tale about one of the poor souls who did my dad lived across the street from a guy who worked in the same mill as dad so he would give dad a ride to and from work and come over when there was nothing else going on just to hang out drank dads beer ate dads snacks what have you anyway dad quite loudly questioned a company policy that disregarded a state holiday and they canned him dad was annoyed but figured thats how things work sometimes and took the unemployment comp happily he went and informed the guy that he wouldnt need a ride that afternoon because he had been sacked the guy made a weird face and said that was fine dad made a mental note of the weird look and went home to start his vacation anyway dad had been outside playing with my nephew when the guy got home dad gave him a friendly wave it was not returned in fact the guy didnt even look in his direction dad figured maybe something else had happened at work that day that was distracting and blew it off as nothing but the next day he didnt wave again just locked his car up and hurried into his house like he wasnt even there so the day after that dad called to him and was once again ignored dad was starting to get pretty miffed at this point why was this guy being such a dick now because they didnt work at the same place anymore thats dumb as hell after a few days of this dad actually went up to his car and tried to talk to him but alas he was still ignoring him with the numerous blowoffs wearing on his mind dad came up with his revenge you see dad was a drinker not a violent mean drinker but a daily beerdrinking guy and so was the guy across the street so much so that he always had a few beers on the way to work at seven in the morning while driving dad never said anything because he grew up during a time when you could drink a bottle of whiskey while driving and the only thing someone would say to you was to not throw it out the window but he was definitely going to say something now about an hour before the guy left for work dad called the nonemergency police line he told them that there would be someone leaving their house at five of seven not only with a buzz on but with a beer in their lap while driving he told them where he was leaving from and what direction he was going in the dispatcher asked him if he was serious and dad said and i quote like fucking cancer at ten to seven dad sat at the kitchen table and waited to see if anything would come of his little tip he saw the guy come out of his house with a few beers right on time he heard the car start up saw him pull out of his parking spaceand then heard a siren whoop twice dad smiled and went out on the front stoop to watch the show and it was a pretty good one too apparently the guy had been busted for dui a few times so he was instantly arrested the car was impounded and he never saw the guy again one time when he was recounting the story to my sisters friend i laughed and said dad youre a snitch he looked over at me shrugged and said he should have just said hi
note this story was set in a time when employment laws in my area were ridiculously lax so new zealand in the s my family comes from a small town the sort where people parking in the middle of the street to have a conversation with you is so natural an occurrence that the locals just drive around the parked car outoftowners bless them think the hold up is only going to be a second or so they could not be more mistaken so laid back but not clinically dead things do move but at a slower pace than other places my mum goes into about the only chain store this town had at the time a place that sells clothes toys beauty products etc she gets what she needs and goes to the counter there is only one the cashier is just standing there chatting to her friend hello hang on she continues talking to her friend behind the counter mum wants a minute and another and another and another and another eventually mum walks away hangs her items on the pegsshelves and then disappears to the back of the store all the while the cashier remains chatting to her friend behind the counter mum eventually returns to the cashier counter and yes shes still busy chatting but without the assortment of garments she was intending on purchasing rather the store manager oh and she knew the store manager did i mention this was a small town so whats been the problem i was waiting here for five minutes she just kept talking now i should remind you this is a laid back town but theres a difference between a few seconds wait for someone to finish their sentence and having someone arrogantly tell you to wait for five whole minutes oh dear what would you like me to do about it fire her suddenly the cashier broke out from her conversation what you cant ask for him to fire me you should have just waited i know another girl who would be perfectly happy to take your job she needs the money plus shed actually be capable of serving customers mum replies okay thezapzupnzs mums name here cashier you finish in two weeks now serve this customer now and you cashiers friend can leave the store i cant remember if mum got a discount or a free gift but i do remember the firing tldr arrogant cashier doesnt serve customer for five minutes gets fired by annoyed customers request edit clarified language in response to noshoesnoshirt thanks i always try to remove ambiguity i just couldnt see it myself
ive never shared this story with anyone when i was i was pretty timid i wasnt bullied or anything just generally quiet and softspoken in my art class i sat next to a girl who was both pretty and very annoying she was giggly and hyperactive all the time still she had a lot of friends while i mostly kept to myself i cant remember how it started but she would eat the erasers from my pencils she thought it was hilarious and other people did too i had a mechanical pencil she stole it took the eraser out and ate it cracking up laughing the first time i just shrugged it off but a mechanical pencil without an eraser is annoying if i used a wooden pencil same thing shed chew it off and we were in the middle of doing sketches so i really needed a pencil and erase so when she ate my eraser the next day and the next and every time i got a new pencil or an eraser i was getting really sick of it i asked her to stop and she just laughed at me everybody would always encourage her to do it she did it until i had no erasers left and she thought it was so fucking funny thinking back now i shouldve just told a teacher but i didnt want anyone to think i was a humorless baby telling on people so i took my own personal revenge for christmas i asked for one of those long eraser pens the one where an eraser shaped almost like string cheese goes inside a plastic container and is pushed out as its used i got one with several replacement erasers i took one of them put it in the bath tub and peed on it i let it dry and put it in the pen i knew she would take care of the rest sure enough when school started back up and i pulled my eraser pen out in art class she said oh is that my christmas present giggling she snatched it from me pulled the eraser out and started chewing on i just smiled and watched her devour the whole thing maybe she finally got her fill of erasers seriously why was she eating them in the first place or maybe that one put her off erasers forever because she never stole another eraser from me
we used to have a couple living next to my parents house who were very noisy theyd usually invite people over for parties and stay up long in to the night with fairly loud music playing in summers theyd host their parties in their garden which was overlooked by most of our houses bedrooms and theyd be laughing and shouting really loud this went on for about a year my dad had tried to talk to them several times and theyd always promise to be quiet next time but next time would just be the same shit all over again so i decided with my brother to carry out our revenge plan our neighbours had recently bought a brand new pickup truck for which they were very proud from what we could gather we used our garden hose to make mud out of a field opposite our house and then took that mud and coated the pickup truck with it we used my dads tools to even it out basically a couple of wood palets that are used on fresh cement to make its surface all smooth and even and after a couple hours we had managed to create a big block of mud around the pickup truck we wrote on it shhhhh we went back in took showers and later that night our furious neighbours came over to ask us if we saw anybody messing with their pickup truck they didnt suspect us outright because nearly everybody in the neighbourhood was asking them to keep quiet to the extend that some people had called the police on them a couple time but they knew why it had happened and needless to say they mostly kept quiet after that
this happened last year on christmas day my wife and i were visiting her brother for christmas and after all of the festivites were done we wanted to eat they did not really feel like cooking so we found out that mcdonalds was open well after we pulled up to the glorious double arches of gold we went inside and ordered our food they were super busy and the wait times were pretty bad i offered to wait for the food since my brother in law had his three daughters that wanted to play in the playhouse as i was waiting i kept noticing a lot of ice on the floor as i continued waiting i noticed it was two teenage girls throwing the ice about amp years old they were giggling and carrying on i ignored it until one pelted me in the head i got my food and as i walked by and looked them dead in the eyes quit throwing the fucking ice they stopped we enjoyed our meal and time together as i was leaving we filled our drinks up and left as we were walking to the cars the two girls from pulled up to me in a mustang the younger one leaned her head out the passenger window and said sorry about the fucking ice my sisterinlaw without even giving me a chance sorry about the fucking ice bitch and empties her large soda right in the girls face they both drive away with the girl in screaming tears we laughed about it the entire night tldr teenage girls being bitches got a face full of soda

alternative title the year i lost my fucking mind and turned into a psycho bitch this story takes place over the course of years with a person i think is probably a pedophile or has a lolicomplex it first began when i was i met derrick when he was in the hallway waiting for my mom to pick me up because i was sick we started talking and he offered to take me home in his truck because i looked as if i was going to pass out on that ride home i fell head over heels for him he was good looking we had similar interests and he seemed to like me back now to give you some clarity i had never had a boyfriend before this i kissed my best friend in elementary school because of a coin flip but i never did anything with anyone up until this time before derrick i was as nonsexual as you can be however i was a hopeless romantic and a lonely nerd in a school where i didnt feel like i fit in i had friend and i wasnt allowed to talk to her because of my parents this probably explains why i was as easily manipulated as i was derrick was a senior in high school yet he focused a lot of attention on me he made me a little mascot of the senior class and i made a lot of friends this way we also took the same math class at the time college algebra he would convince me to do both of our homework so he could finally pass the class in my naivety i agreed making sure to change my handwriting and give him some wrong answers i was the nerd so this was nothing new to me plus i wanted to keep him around he asked me out months after we met this is where everything started going bad first derrick started trying to control how i looked he hated my short hair i would pull my bangs back in clips and put on a heavy amount of makeup but he would still comment on how he felt he was with a year old boy he wouldnt talk to me if i wore the color yellow he also made fun of my size i was small im still small to this day and i hardly had any breasts to speak of my mother bought my clothing and she would buy plain color low cut shirts simply because they were the only ones we could get cheaply one day while hanging out behind the school with his friends he yanked down my shirt by the collar showing all his friends my small breasts he yelled at them well at least your girlfriends have tits his friends after that would call me the titless wonder which would then spread around the high school for the rest of my high school days until i broke down and got a ged but thats another story he would also call me asian and make chingchong noises at me i have squinty eyes yes but i am not asian i called him out on his bullshit there but that also spread around to the point where i quit my job last year because a girl from high school harassed me about it now remember how i said i was nonsexual he was oversexual derrick would give me rides in his truck and during those rides he would ask for a kiss a french kiss i agreed thinking no harm no foul then it escalated he would stick his hands down my pants feel me up as we kissed i was uncomfortable and i would usually tell him no until i broke down then he wanted me to touch him primarily on his penis i told him no and he threatened to throw me out of the car while he was driving he threatened to leave me for sarah a cheerleader and band geek i finally agreed nothing at that time went further than touching but i was highly uncomfortable he graduated that year and we stopped talking then two years later when i was and he was i found him again we reconnected and i thought he had changed a lot i was right in a way he was a lot worse derrick lived a trailer park by the high school so i would go over there for a couple hours every day just to be with him i never lost that head over heels factor for him those days my hair was longer and i dressed a little more girly he would tell me to straighten my hair how to do my makeup call me ugly tell me how flat i was how i could never find anyone who would really like me like he did he would sometimes tell me that he hated me and he would rather be with anyone else but me i lost a lot of the confidence i had i wasnt a loner anymore he came between my friends when my best friend passed in december due to suicide he wouldnt let me go to the funeral because they were a faggot and they deserved to die he threatened to leave me then by then i was broken enough to believe him of course there came the sex i was still fairly nonsexual but he would force himself upon me it started with handjobs which i thought it would stop there then one day out of nowhere he forced himself in my mouth i nearly clamped down using my teeth but he shoved himself so far in that i vomited all over him he pulled out and told me to do it again this is also the person who took my virginity and told me how shitty i was at sex one day i was on facebook and i saw a picture of him kissing another girl sarah the cheerleader i friended her and i started going through pictures they had been dating for years longer than i have been in the picture everything slowly began to click in my head the sex the weird hours the fact he never took me out the calling me baby and honey and then i got mad that night i went over to his house we had sex that night and then he went to sleep he had two cars his truck and a dodge challenger he was in the middle of restoring that challenger and it was beginning to look pretty i usually sat with him while he was fixing them so i knew somewhat what i was doing i grabbed the bat he kept and smashed the windshield of that challenger with as much force as i could i kept smashing it until it was almost gone i smashed all the lights i poured a monster energy drink where the oil goes any sort of wires or tubes i saw i ripped up i went to the inside and i ripped his dashboard and threw it in the back i ripped the leather seats he had just installed with a crafters knife and then poured another energy drink on the foam i ripped up the leather on the steering wheel writing the word pedo on it i destroyed the carpet with his soda and poured some on the radio i shoved a can underneath the brake pedal i broke the bat on his truck i smashed everything i could there i did the same thing i did with the challenger i poured his sodas in the oil i poured it three cans in his gas tank i smeared dog shit from his dog shit bucket all over the inside the carpet the steering wheel the seats the pedals i smashed every window every light and attacked the body until the bat broke in half then i punched it so hard i broke my hand i keyed along the side of the truck cheater liar asshole dick pedo i broke the back of the flatbed or whatever you call it so he could not haul anything around i loosened his tires hoping they would fall off then i grabbed all his tools and shoved them in the neighbors trash can i also took his sets of keys and chucked them down the street i blocked his number and walked home that day while i was at home i sent every picture i had of derrick and me and sent it to sarah she wasnt going to leave him she was pregnant but i hoped to warn her i also called his job and let his boss know that he was seeing a girl that was underage i dont know exactly what happened after that point i broke off all contact with him i do know he married sarah and they have a little girl together its a small town so i do see him on occasion at my job he pretends not to know me im perfectly happy with that tldr i got fed up with a manipulative asshole so i became a crazy ex 
first time poster long time lurker this could be pettyrevenge but ill give my justifications afterwards and this is just one of probably many stories to come for those who know and is going through your head based on the title i like you already so there i was on my birthday at the stroke of midnight just given a day of paid time off from my eternally shitty job working rd shift at a factory i think to myself awesome ill go home and maaaayyyybbbbeeee get myself a birthday blowjob i mean ive been dating her for the past years and have gotten one every year for my birthday but theres always the chance i wont no big deal i walk in the door all is quiet which instantly strikes me as kind of strange she usually watches tv at this time of night maybe she just passed out i think nothing of it so i am walking back to our bedroom when i hear it the unmistakable headboard against the wall with slight barely audible womanly moans coming from the bedroom and promptly freeze after a few seconds i quietly sit down on the cold linoleum floor and think to myself shes cheating on me on my birthday on our bed in the house that i pay rent wtf but theres one thing that everyone who knows me knows about me i dont act rashly ever i think things through and you really dont want to get on my revenge side its cold and its calculating i have been referred to as spock on a number of occasions so the plan is hatched for the instant revenge she only likes to bang in the dark i have really good dark vision she does not the house is pitch black ive got this i mutter to myself i quietly enter the bedroom and proceed to head to the always open closet across from the bed and proceed to grab our wooden studded paddle from it hes still on top of her continuing to go at it with a steadily increasing pace it is everything in my power to hold back my infuriation with the situation i grab the paddle and a box that was on top of it proceeds to fall making a very loud noise i crouch down to stay hidden and think to myself shit here i am catching her cheating on me and im about to be the one that gets caught but they dont stop hes a madman on a mission to blow his load which hes obviously very close to doing i get to the end of the bed and stand there in full batters swing ready waiting for the right moment it was was quite an eternity waiting for a man that is screwing my girlfriend of six years on my bed in my house on my birthday to blow his load and then it happens he pulls out and is about to pop on her stomach i instantly realize shes doing this unprotected and i spring out the full swing now with added hatred of condomless oomph and whack that blood curdling wince and then eventual cry was absolute music to my ears direct hit to the ass she asks what in the hell just happened his reply is something just smacked my ass so hard i think im bleeding this is when i personally think it hit her she frantically rushes to the side of the bed to flick on the bedside lamp click and there i am standing there tall and proud safety glasses still on holding what i have now dubbed the meat grinder in hand staring down at the both of them with an unholy unflinching gaze that is commonly referred to as the up stare a stare of psychic withdrawal inducing soul destruction unwavering in its intensity and then i focus my gaze directly into his eyes calm as a statue and officially shut down of all emotions by this point it is now that i realize that the man screwing her was a man that ive known for years not necessarily a friend but someone whom i trusted and knew i trusted and then i say in an extremely giddy and overtly flamboyant gay tone whos up for a threeeeeeeessssoooooooommmmmmeeeeeeee with an evil cheekish grin afterwards i have never seen a man get his shit and get out the door so fast in my life ever it was per near instantaneous that he was gone she looks at me i look at her and i say the inevitable truth you know that every single one of my past girlfriends has cheated on me and you know exactly what that means im dead to you huh she replies in a dejected monotone voice of humility after you leave tonight i will not recognize either of your existence if we meet again i will more than likely never speak to you while standing there staring at her the whole time she gets up head hanging in shame gathers clothes gets in her car and leaves thats when everything in me just collapses my heart my soul my emotions my ego and pride everything i proceed to go to the living room crack a beer and cry for hours im a man but im only human the next day her mom calls me up and asks what in the hell happened last night so i reply bluntly with this tldr i discovered her sleeping with a someone i knew snuck into the room and proceeded to slap his ass as hard as i humanly could with our wooden studded paddle as he was coming on her stomach she busts out laughing at her daughters stupidity and my retaliation and heads on over for a little bit more of a talk instead of on the phone i still talk with her mom once in a while i think i might call her tomorrow but havent said a word to cunty mccockbag or anuspucker vondouchey since after the fact i learned that he was not the only she cheated on me with either i genuinely wish her nothing but the best and no ill will she just wont be getting a single damn thing from me from what i understand she hasnt been able to hold a job since and is with that guy huge downgrade to boot i will say im still healing about everything even nearly years later now ive been torn up entirely too much by women and i just want that cycle to end im taking my sweet ass time with getting back into the dating world sure its lonely sometimes but id rather be lonely then years down the road at and having this crap repeat all over again reasons i figured this was pro over petty swift decisive thought out and planned j uses butt bludgeoner its super effective not a rash im gonna end your bloodline meow something else i cant think of anyways hope you enjoyed this bit of a long post tune in next time for the horrible upstairs neighbors and the dog semen filled pillow j out months later edit i was just informed that he cheated on her repeatedly is now single and heartbroken i actually spent the time to call her and have a chat first thing she said now i know how you felt im sorry j which honestly sucks on one hand i feel vindicated even more on the other i wouldnt wish it upon anyone even her but this pretty much officially closes the story what goes around comes around and maybe just maybe we can be friends its been long enough and i absolutely do not want to get back together that would be another nightmare all over again time will tell peace out guys will get to the horrible upstairs neighbors and the dog semen filled pillow soon enough
several years back when myspace was still on top my family came down to visit and stay at my mothers place for a few days among them was my stoner racist idiot is idiot redundant cousin i had stopped by and at some point i got on her pc on my account and started doing some touchups on a website i was building for a local restaurant something came up and i had to step out of the house for a bit i did not set this computer up with passwords for the user accounts still dumb but ive since learned as the only two people who have physical access to the computer were my mother and i so just leaving my stuff logged in was never an issue but i had failed to take into account the stoner racist idiot cousin while im away he decides for possibly the first time in his life that he would like to read something unfortunately he decided that it would take the form of snooping through my email chat logs and internet history again it was my moms pc so his search for whatever crazy porn i might have been into was fruitless naturally when i get back he brags about how much of a lt haxxr he is by telling me about his recent exploits through my personal email logs etc if he would have kept his mouth shut i might not have known so as soon as possible i went through and changed all my passwords i couldnt take the chance that this little halfwit had access to websites i had built for myself and others among other things in a way he really did do me a favor by showing me that i needed to be more paranoid about leaving accounts logged in and password security ahhh yes the revenge part password security my cousin had logged into his aim account while this was going on it was set up to save login info this particular version of aim was pretty bad at storing passwords securely so after about seconds worth of effort i had his password which he used on every single account he had i use this to see what hes up to on myspace his profile is filled with pics and videos of girls in bikinis alcohol and pictures of hitler that just isnt proper so i changed it hitler becomes martin luther king jr girls making out turn into men slipknot videos turn into bob ross instructional videos the cherry on top was his slipknot fansite being turned into a my little pony fansite at this time there was no such thing as a brony i was thinking about changing it back minus the racistsexist crap after he apologized so i made backups to be quite honest i was probably just telling myself that to allay my own guilt over changing his settings but then hitler naturally when he goes to log in he sees the changes and flips out he jumped to conclusions and mistakenly thought other kids in his high school were behind the defacement he started a fistfight during school which ended up being the last straw for his schools administration he has a history and got himself expelled for the rest of the year at this point i was still ready to change stuff back and keep in mind i hadnt changed his passwords when he figured out it was me and sent me this message umm ya i dont know why the fuck you did but i want you to unlock all my accounts u hacked and put the back to the way they were before u fuckin touched them so no i dont like threats at all at this point his password seemed like it was enslaved to just two people like it needed to be freed see the world and all so somehow it got posted to a forum my friends and i visited it quickly when to nsfw town and within a few days his accounts were banned afterwards he told me he was most upset about losing his rare slipknot jpegs found one screencap lost the nsfw ones tldr specialneeds neonazi gets his myspace sanitized starts fights in high school gets expelled 
as above xpost rpettyrevenge as it was suggested it belongs here following a line of traffic in town about mphand the lane to the left of me was a left turn filter the motorbike who had zoomed up behind me at a fair speed decided he wanted to overtake me and went down the left turn lane and then popped out in front of me far too close and yes im a biker so i do know i flashed my lights at him once and he freaked out at me turning in the saddle to give me the finger now fair enough do it once but he carried on doing it shouting from inside his helmet doh and shaking his fist at me and this is important not paying attention to the road in front i saw my opportunity i opened my eyes dropped my jaw gripped the wheel and slammed on my brakes then came the best moment of my life as i saw the dawning realization in his eyes as he imagined what i was braking for which must be in front of him my words cannot do justice to his frantic attempt to turn his body snatch at the handlebar brake hard and steer all at the same moment whilst is brain was engaged at trying to figure out the emergency just as well i was already braking as the subsequent swerve wobble flip and bounce on the floor in front of everyone was a joy to my heart honest i did try not to be giggling when i drove past him struggling to pick up his bike 
when i was i moved into a house out in portland oregon barely knowing anyone in the city i needed a roommate so i craigslisted an ad and conducted a small set of interviews to fill the extra room a guy named travis moved into the room eventually he was younger than me by about years but he had a consistent job and seemed reasonable so i took him moving in three weeks later i find out he lied about everything in the interview he had no job his dad paid his rent he had a click of collarpopped douche bags that would hang out at the house all day i had invited in a self proclaimed playa into the house face to face he would be nice to me in his sly way when i left the house he would subtly search through my room and steal petty shit a used fax machine quarters out of my change jar outdated mp player old watches he found to be baller etc i confronted him a few times and he would always deny it when i caught him openly eating my food and denying it i attempted to kick him out he stayed by citing his tenants rights because most of it was petty i decided to look the other way while his ego grew bigger things died down for a few weeks one day i come back home from work and travis had stolen the only shirt i knew he would steal from my closet it was a two year old lacoste shirt when he had the nerve to wear it in front of me i decided this was the final straw giving him his last way out i decided to ask him hey i have that same exact shirt in my closet i figured if he had any soul left he would simply say i borrowed it from your closet he decided to lie about it telling me he had gotten it from the mall a few days ago the audacity the sociopath switch in my head decided to flip on i knew travis thought i was too pussy to ask for the shirt back he thought i was a doormat and i was going to play directly into that i understood the mindset of a young something alpha male travis birthday was coming up in about a month and a half he made it known because he told me his mom was going to get him a new burberry shirt and i was going to make that the day i strike i played into his fake friendlyness and started hanging out with him i made friends with his douche bag friends when they started calling me i knew i had them id buy them occasional drinks when we were out to seed my future plans of generosity birthday comes game time travis had an obsession with doing cocaine over the last few months nothing big since he was broke so most of his binges were in small amounts i pulled him over in the middle of the day and told him i had a birthday surprise for him to pump up his ego more i told him i only did this for the best of my boys we go out for a night of drinks i buy him enough drinks to get him shit housed and we head back to the house for the after party i had called a few females over during the night to make the after party request legit when we get to the house i walk out of my room with half an eight of cocaine in my hands travis this is the surprise youve been waiting for i dump a mound of white onto a black plate and spelled his name out on it i was going to take a picture of travis hitting the fattest line of cocaine in existence with his name one it with his name laid out in cocaine over a black plate the stage was set i hand travis a rolled up twenty and told him to hit it the pandemonium behind his back built the pressure cooker need to push him into doing it as travis sucked his head down to the plate i told him to give me a party pose next to his special surprise travis produced the single best duck face pose i had ever seen one hand holding the rolled up twenty and the other to throw his white boy downward deuce gotcha the next morning everyone was flaccid the girls had left about an hour after we reached the house and the chemical leftovers of the alcohol and cocaine destroyed any productivity planned within the house i call up my friend nick to induce the second part of the plan nick was labeled as my russian body guard he was and weighed in at about pounds of pure muscle when nick arrives me and him go into travis room and drag him by his legs into the living room travis was startled but barely awake i bring him a laptop with the picture i had taken last night of him you are looking at a picture i took of you last night ive already uploaded it into a image hosting site and copied this picture into a couple of safe places there is no erasing this picture understand yes youre job right now is to prevent this from getting sent to your parents the only way prevent this from getting sent to your parents is to pay for the coke i bought you last night and move the fuck out because travis did not have a car i gave him rides to his parents work and place of residence i also knew a few of the addresses of where his friends parents lived google travis was scared shitless of his dad if i had threatened to send any details of his fast life to his dad travis would obey everything in the end i had travis pay dollars for the half eight i had only paid for travis moved out of the house within the same day about months after the situation i moved out of the house we shared i sent the picture to his parents to his parents bosses to all his parents neighbors then to all the friends parents addresses the cost about dollars all paid for ala travis i do have proof picture is around on one of my computers and ill post that in the update if people are interested tldr talked my clepto thief of a roommate into buying a sack coke and having me take a picture of him doing a line of cocaine with

this is an oldie so the details may be a little vague but only just found this sub many years ago i entered into my first mobile phone cell contract with a large telecommunications company here in the uk i signed for a month term and also signed for an odd on to the contract that gave me extra data at a small additional charge this add on was not contracted i simply had to give notice of cancellation a few days prior to the payment date and the payment would not be taken and the add on would expire at the end of the billing period after a couple of months i provided the notice of cancellation and received confirmation that i would no longer be charged i think no more of it and live my life happily at the end of the contract i log into my account management website to confirm that i wish to cancel and dont want to rollover onto a new plan here i notice that i am still being charged for the add on that i cancelled i look through my history and notice that months of payments had been taken after the cancellation thats almost that i hadnt wished to pay the next day i phone their customer service department who informs me that they can see that it was due for cancellation but could not explain why the cancellation was never actioned they were very apologetic but explained that i should log a complaint via email and it would be looked into i do just that and after a lot of chasing around and being sold excuses such as outstanding system issues that prevented the cancellation and were still unresolved to not following the correct cancellation procedure so the add on was not cancelled after a lot of back and forth i grow tired of explanations and just cut to the chase can i get a refund of the charges that i was not expecting to pay and was informed would be cancelled please issue to this account acc info i attached the previous mail that i had received at the time of cancellation as evidence they still refused to issue a refund and instead offered me month of free add on not acceptable i did some digging and found their customer services directors email address and ccs him into my response which read the same as the above email i received the following reply hi doydoy thanks for contacting us and apologies for the confusion caused we will immediately issue a credit to your account for the amount of as a good will gesture regards xyz the reply did no longer have the director listed as a cc so i guess i scared the normal adviser into action however by this point weeks or so had passed since i initially logged my complaint so i was a little pissed i responded with thanks xyz i appreciate the good will gesture however as i have been incorrectly charged for a service i did not wish for and a service i had understood to be cancelled i believe i am entitled to a fill refund of the services paid as such please refund the full to the same account i received a very short reply i have issued a refund notice which should be processed in working days thanks felt bad for the guy who simply forgot to use the correct wording when issuing me with the initial payment but by this time i was frustrated and just wanted the money i enjoyed the extra they gave me tldr company failed to stop charges to my account i received a good will gesture in place of a refund pushed for a refund as well as the good will gesture and earned for my efforts 
background i am a sysadmin for a web devmarketing company for those who didnt know yesterday was sysadmin appreciation day where coworkers are encouraged to give appreciation to their sysadmins one of my coworkers lets call him matt is smart slighty arrogant egotistical and a bit of a dick he loves to tease and annoy people as a joke and hell happily let it go into harassment if he can get away with it on the flipside if you do anything to him hoo boy he doesnt take it well tldr he can dish it but he cant take it anyway so yesterday he was looking forward to some appreciation from the rest of the company as he believed he deserved it and he let us all know this which he does to a degree because he has been doing a lot of the shit work weve been secretly assigning those tickets to him p over the course of the day we did get a lot of thanks from our colleagues but one of the project teams came down with beer and had to hide the project name due to the nda in thanks for all the work weve done for them well by we they actually meant me and they said as much as i had been the sole sysadmin working on the hellish project the rest of the team had no issue with this because they knew how much hell id gone through working on it but matt didnt like this one fucking bit the only present we get and he couldnt have any of it insufferable so he became very vocal about this and insisted that the cake was actually for all of us not that he cared about the others i was planning on sharing anyway but looking at how he was acting i saw my chance to piss him off revenge for all the false rumours he spread to make my life difficult revenge for all the times hed randomly tamper with my linux shell settings right before project deadlines revenge for all the other things hed done to piss me off for his shits and giggles i insisted that the cake was only for me and that he should fuck off he started calling me a greedy cunt and a fat bastard and a bunch of other things he insisted on some cake because he had done some work on the project as well he had actually but it was so minor no one remembered or cared except for him right now because he wanted some cake so i laughed and said sure okay heres your piece and threw some icing at him he got even more angry at me and i explained that it was proportional to his contribution to the project he got so angry he tried insulting me more but it came out in a splutter and he stormed off mumbling something about getting lunch when he left the rest of us burst into laughter at how childish he was acting we decided to prank him even more so we took photos of us eating all the cake and only left one plate on my desk to make it look like i had eaten all of it while he was away i also knew that hed start to play the victim and try get others on his side so i sent out an email to the company explaining the prank and asking that they play along and ignore any rantings from him turns out it was a good move as hed already started texting several people about me being a greedy bastard and that this is why you shouldnt give rohei anything so when he came back he was still petulent and sulky and stayed like this for the rest of the day it wasnt helped by other victims of his deciding to get some revenge and coming down with donuts chocolate etc just for me p this was completely unintended and a masterful stroke on their part because he stayed so upset that he stormed out of the office the minute it hit he didnt even take any of the free beer and hes normally all over free alcohol jesus how we laughed when he had left who knew that the coolerthanyou matt would get so upset over something like cake i sure as hell didnt and i hope he enjoys the photos of us eating the cake that are in his inbox edit and how did the cake taste delicious d edit so yesterday he came in an saw the pictures and seemed to take it pretty well he laughed at them and admitted that we got him good i think he realised that he was being a stupid twat about the whole thing i mean its only cake for crying out loud however im still keeping my guard up as this may be a ruse to be honest

this story takes place a couple years ago but its probably my most satisfying story of revenge many years ago i was big into world of warcraft i specifically liked something called model editing which is a term for a type of hacking where you change clientside files to modify the clientside experience only mostly aesthetic stuff but some things which affect the server side that i never messed with because i didnt want to get banned i was a member on some forums for this type of thing where people shared their projects with the community i saw it as a form of art pretty much a couple years ago i hadnt played world of warcraft for some time and my account was inactive but i decided to go back and check some old threads i posted and reread old comments on the model editing forums for nostalgia purposes only instead of navigating through the website to find my old posts i just did a google search to find it the top hit was a thread on some forum id never heard of but with my exact same title text and pictures i of course decided to do some snooping and found that this person had reposted just about every single thread i had posted without giving me credit at all as if he had created them himself interestingly they were all fairly new posts too i was pretty annoyed but figured that there wasnt really anything i could do the download link he posted had long since been taken down by the hosting website and even if it still worked the model edit wouldnt have been compatible with the many years newer version of wow and yet he was still getting positive comments and upvotes the only option i could see was to post a few annoyed comments on some of his posts about how he was stealing my work after getting no response i decided that i would go to my photobucket account and remove the old pictures so essentially his threads would be saying look at this model edit i did followed by zero pictures and a download link that doesnt work however when i got there i found a much more satisfying option apparently photobucket allows you to edit your pictures and then replace the original file with the newly edited one armed with this new resource i overlayed some text on one of the pictures in his newest thread giving credit to myself and posting a link to the original thread and forum within hours there were negative comments showing up on all of his threads about how hes a plagiarist he quickly took down my edited picture and posted a short credit to me at the bottom of his post but the damage was done people started posting original links in other threads that hed stolen from what i can tell he eventually became a bit of a pariah heres the original thread heres one i made a couple minutes ago for verification 
a long time ago in a state far far away a college town in a midwestern state in the early s our little pizza shop had a big problem with a couple of frat houses actually a lot of the pizza and delivery places had problems with the frat houses that was in all likelihood a big problem with a few bad apples but there were a couple of houses that seemed to have an even higher ah quotient the issue for us was related to our minutes or free policy long since discontinued and the thought that with some trickery and lying you might be able to get a pizza without handing over any cash since we were anal about times and did in fact give away pizza when it was late the occasional smartass that tried to get a free pizza without having it be late got exactly what was coming to them usually a visit from the cops if they got too out of hand a stern rebuke from a manager was usually enough though but one house in particular seemed to have quite a few bad orders sometimes i would come into work and there would be a note by the phones for this particular house lets just call it a the note would say something like we are no longer taking orders from anyone in the a frat on really rare occasion tonight were not taking orders from any frat yeah they were that problematic note i have nothing to compare this to maybe some other pizza people want to share im curious if this is still going on or was commonplace one night in particular one of our drivers comes back from a not just with the unpurchased pizza but with piss all over him seems he got to the house on time and rather than go through the usual im a real dick and want to challenge your time even though its been like minutes they simply refused to open the door it was a two story house and this guy was persistent when he went to a side door they opened a window above him and dumped it on him making things worse this driver was a hard working rednecklooking kind of guy everyone in the shop loved working with him he had a great attitude and was the kind of person whod be there for you if you needed him dumping piss on him was the last straw so the manager calls the cops and they drive over to the ole a frat house and the stage is set the door is answered by a lone a member who comes across as just your honest hardworking college guy whos really sorry for the confusion the cop inquires if hes aware that someone dumped piss on the driver and this guy conveys that yes hes aware and theyre all really sorry they didnt mean to do it it was a college prank gone bad awe shucks kind of manner cop which person here did it awe shucks hem haws around and finally confesses that in fact it was he the poor hardworking college guy that did it and hes really really sorry so my manager looks at the cop and more or less conveys that its time to throw the book at awe shucks they slap the cuffs on him and to his fratmates dismay hes tucked into a squad car and everyone heads down to the local police station for a booking that will involve a weekend in jail or someone bailing this guy out its not going to be something a simple apology solves in other words theyre taking this guys confession when a carload of a frat guys arrives at the station asking to see the cop thats doing the intake paperwork my manager is still there with the driver and this is where the revenge portion really kicks in this wasnt even planned and i can only imagine that the cops were really sick of the a frat bs because what happens next would have been awesome to catch on cell phone video believe it or not there was a time when such things were not commonplace two of the arriving a party are having a rare moment of guilty conscience and proceed to confess to the officer that its not awe shucks who dumped the piss but in fact it was them the cop proceeds to take their confession down verifies on all ends that yes in fact it was these two clowns and not awe shucks who dumped the piss everyone is in agreement so they book the two guys and put them in jail for the night by this time its well past midnight then awe shucks after lamenting about how he wishes it wouldnt have come to this why wouldnt we all just accept an apology for this it was just a harmless prank goes to leave where are you going says the cop im free to go arent i says awe shucks cop proceeds to book awe shucks for some kind of false witness charge and he joins his two buddies for the night later that night a bunch of mindless vandalism happens to the a house sometime in the wee hours of the morning say after some late night pizza people are done cleaning their store from what i remember it involved some kind of construction bridge paint being applied to the bricks and windows of their house its been a while and i wish i could have seen the application i just remember seeing the house for weeks messed up with big block letters and paint on the windows and it doesnt really end there the university ended up revoking the as right to have a house on campus 
this happened awhile ago it was back when i was in high school there was this guy that would hang out with my group of friends but it seemed like no one really liked this guy even though no on really wanted him around he would always somehow figure out where we were at anyhow this guys was constantly an asshole to me making offhand comments and jibes at me all the time it was around the time that every one of my friends was getting their driving license and just starting to drive at this time there was some friendly window chalking of each others cars nothing harmful just if you saw a buddies car you would write something on their windshield like got you bitch something like that fast forward a couple of months and that asshole gets my car he doesnt use window chalk though he pours syrup on my car and rubs candles on my windowswindshield it was a cold night so the syrup froze on my car and the only way to get the candle wax off of windows is with a razor i find out that it was the asshole that did this to me and i swear revenge my car back then was a junker that i didnt really care about but the assholes car was a year old jeep so the next weekend one of my buddies is having everyone over to his house to play poker now poker is the assholes favorite game to play so i know he will be there when my buddy calls to invite me over i decline feigning sickness i plan on getting my revenge that night since the asshole has an idea that i will try and get revenge he gets my buddy to let him pull his jeep inside his garage so when i get there i check all the doors to the garage theyre locked i then do a little reconnaissance and find that everyone is in the basement playing poker then i sneak in the front door and creep into the garage with my bag of goodies there is the jeep i proceed to dump cheese sauce salsa syrup chocolate syrup cooking oil bird seed and planting soil i also fully covered every one of his windows in green candle wax i then slinked away and went home the best part was apparently eveyone stayed the night at my buddies so the asshole didnt get to his car for around hours apparently the combination of all that stuff messed up his paint job a little bit and he had to get it redone he also suspected it was me but couldnt ever prove it he threatened me with law suits but never filed one i know this isnt as good as most of the ones ive seen on here but i felt like badass when i did this
i took a job as it assistant for a local firm and the boss it manager we shall call him pa for passive aggressive or positively arrogant if you prefer pa had been with the company for about years during this time he wrote a custom web solution involving thousands of files as well as a hardware solution that was almost completely lacking in documentation let alone adequate documentation i should have suspected something was up when he took me into a server room with a sea of ethernet cables labeled only on one end leading into various holes in the wall when i asked what was the meaning of the cryptic numbers on the cables a a for example and was referred to topical map with only eight numbers and nothing else i knew i was in trouble at least he made an attempt to write some wikis about how to do this or that but they were so vague all they would do was serve for his reminders but would not work for anyone else before me he had hired a procession of assistants only to have them let go for no rhyme nor reason according to a coworker he would belittle me for taking so long to do tasks telling me i should take calculated risks about what i was supposed to do but programmers are taught to be thorough and to not take risks with company data by doing things you are not sure of he would be rude and insulting when had no time to guide me or help me understand his custom system i have to admit his code was great but his attitude was guaranteed to put anyone off from wanting to ask him anything towards the end of the job there i was so stressed out it was literally killing me people would remark that i looked white as a sheet and ready to drop i could not sleep at night and i had to crawl to the bathroom because i would black out trying to walk at night well after a year he decided he was going to take a vacation and leave everything to me for a month he also sprung on me an unannounced project of importing data to be done in two and a half hours on the first monday after he left the data import alone took about four hours so how in the hell he thought i could do this huge data import in the time expected was beyond me the day i was let go he told me that i was not a good fit for the company and they let me go with severance pay which was nice but during the interview he cited three projects i did not get done in time and after i left i realized that one of them was a project he told me to stop working on and another was a project to upgrade some software they had spent money on but i discovered bugs in the software and was told to not install it till the bugs were fixed it took the makers of the software six weeks to fix the bugs and i got commendation from them and the president of the company i worked at for being very helpful in tracking down the bugs after i got home i realized pa let me go blaming me for late projects he told me to delay on i also began to remember all the insulting things he said and i began to figure it out this delay in figuring out what happened is a feature of ptsd i was friends with the owner of the company and i wrote him an email about the issues i told him how he keeps hiring people to do it assistant yet required them to already know the custom system he built over a period of years i mentioned how he refused to help new hires familiarized themselves with the code heck it was only after months that i was given access to the code to even look at i asked him if he didnt find it suspicious that he would hire someone go on a large vacation then come back and fire them i said how many assistant it persons has companyname gone through and how many more will companyname go through before they realize that the person they are looking for does not exist and start to insist that pa teach the new hire the ropes it was right after this that pa was told that no new hires would be accepted and that new coding would have to be done out of house aka hire contract programmers none in the area wanted to touch the project so they ended up hiring a team from india pa possibly because he lacked interpersonal skills got so frustrated having to explain what code he wanted was supposed to do finally quit with the statement im tired of all the bs he now works as a programmer elsewhere but thankfully he is not supervising anyone else ps in case the revenge was missed he ended up with a job that had less prestige less pay no underlings to abuse like he did others it was a job that they frequently offered to college students for an hour i dont know what he got before but i know it was good enough for him to take a month vacation in vietnam it caused him difficulty it made me feel somewhat better and somewhat vindicated and a hell of a lot better to know he would not be able to mistreat another person tldr manager refuses to manage and train ends up frustrated into quitting after i point out his lack of performance to the owner after i was let go
i was in a relationship with this guy for years we were happy i had introduced him to all my family including my son then i found out that i was one of women he was in a relationship with i found this out by the first woman contacting me and then the whole story came to light well once i found this out i decided i needed my revenge i knew that this guy was driving without insurance or tax on his car so i decided to make an anonymous tip off to crime stoppers british service to dob in people who commit crime i didnt think much of it until i got a call from the other woman who asked me if i knew why his car was clamped outside her house i said i did not know it just so happens that on that morning he had stayed over night at her house and when she left for work she took his mobile phone the house phone and her keyboard with her so she could peruse his phone at her leisure at work without him being able to tell people he didnt have his phone etc obviously because she still didnt trust him well it turns out that the police decided to clamp his car that day and with him unable to get in touch with anyone he had around a hour walk to his mums house so he could sort his car out oh and by the way that morning the woman found out there was a third woman involved with him when she took his phone that day so justice served 
noise complaints are a common theme in rprorevenge i have a nice story to tell that falls in that vein for sure this is an abbreviated version just the high or low points of the story my best friend call her t and her husband call him c have a sturdy large brick outbuilding behind their family home that serves as her husbands cs practice area and recording studio we can all get really loud in there without getting in trouble with the neighborhood or the cops cs dad call him pops is sort of one of those bleeding heart types one day pops announces that cs brother will be moving back in and he goes out and divides the studio and puts a second door in so that the brotherwe will call him ds for dipshit has a place to live while he is once again looking for a job ds cant hold a job cause hes an alcoholic well after all this happens needless to say when c is actually trying to do recording ds is blaring his shitty counrtry music at one point ds has put the recording process weeks behind right before c and t were to go on vacation after informing needed people what was going on and explaining the situation to them they take off for vacation after some discussion about what to do a plan was hatched inch folded horn subwoofers after they had been gone for a day or so i had gone in to do some work myself and even though they were gone the noise continued time to enact the plan lined up the subwoofers in a nice w pattern wired them to the amps and set a tone generator for hertz signal and turned it up just loud enopugh that you could vaguely feel the vibration in the outside wall but obviously couldnt here it that kind of noise is maddening to say the least it took whole days to rus ds out of there and in the end we took out the door and knocked down the wall and got our happy and quiet studio back the way it was meant to be country music free dont blast your shitty music around people who have more power and equipment than you do cause you arent going to win
growing up our yard backed up to the back yard of the neighbors behind us with a gate they were a mormon family with kids around our ages and we were somewhat friends with them so were always playing back and forth in each others yards one day one of the girls invited my sister and i over to play and to show off the new swimming pool her father had bought for them it was one of those high sided hard plastic wading pools and invited us to jump in this continued for a couple days coming over to play as usual a few days later the kids told us that their father had told us we werent allowed to play in the water because i swear i am not making this up we were gentiles and therefore would pollute the water my sister was about years old and i was about at the time we may have been young but we knew enough to be really upset and hurt and once it was explained to us by our parents just exactly he meant by that we were angry really angry a bit after this maybe a week or two we overheard the mother telling our mom that they would be gone for a week to go camping and if she would keep an eye on the house yep too filthy to wade in a kiddie pool but a great resource when they wanted something a plot of revenge was planned between my sister and i waiting until the day after theyd left we spent the morning drinking lemonade copious amounts of lemonade and then we waddled across the yards to their unsullied pool and proceeded to drain about two gallons of pee into the water on the way back we also raided their large garden filling up on anything ripe enough to eat i cannot express the sense of satisfaction on hearing them gleefully splashing away the day they returned and the next day and the next unwittingly baptizing themselves in the bodily fluids of their dirty atheist neighbors bonus we overheard the mom complaining to our mom about how they were having to buy chicken wire for the garden to keep the animals out because they had lost so many vegetables a summer my sister and i will remember fondly for the rest of our lives 
my boss was the meanest and just like nastiest woman i have ever met she was a terrible boss and was mean to every woman in the office she was really nice to the males though shed make comments about our appearance our work and things that were irrelevant to our jobs she really knew how to hit below the belt she told me that i should focus on my career instead of a relationship because i wasnt the type of girl guys could ever commit to called a girl going on maternity leave lazy she told another girl that her heels were way too high and this wasnt a whore house she once even told me an assignment that i had worked really hard for and she had promised me im just going to let chris and matt do it because i dont think a girl could handle it lots of travel and negotiating involved like a day before i was supposed to get started meanwhile she was continuously complementing the guys saying things like its so nice to have an office full of real men and you guys can handle anything i wouldnt be anywhere without my team of boys she was totally out of hand and inappropriate even they guys had noticed that her behavior was strange anyway one night i spot her pretty drunk at some random bar flirting with every guy and was just really really sloppy overall then i saw her take off her wedding and try and slip it into her pocket but because she was so drunk she hadnt realized she had dropped it on the ground i quickly pick it up and pocket it myself at first i thought my revenge was to let her freak out about it for a little bit and then give it back to her later but then she started making out with this random guy at the bar and i came up with a much better plan i as slyly as possible snapped a picture of her and the guy made sure to obscure his facewhile making sure it was clearly her anyway i kept the ring and took a picture with the ring on the pinky of my male friends hand the following monday i sent a pictures to her husband with a short note that i fucked your wife and she loved it so much she let me keep her ring i sort of realized its not all plausible that she would give someone her wedding ringbut i just ran with it i kind hoped that the ridiculousness of the letter would be overshadowed by her husbands rage i ended up anonymously returning the ring as well it was clearly expensive and i felt too guilty keeping it and quitting a few days later as well i never got a full follow up on the effects of my actions but i do know her and her husband separated after that from one of my old coworkers edit my grammar was pretty bad sorry 
so this was years ago i think i was maybeee years old this particular summer camp that i had been going to for a couple years had all their kids split up boys and girls in their own camps and then different age groups had their own teepees lead by their team leaders who were usually high school aged kids this year i was in the rd oldest group which happened to be the most populated group there was always a bit of competition between the boys teams this year things were getting heated the big kids were beating us in almost every thing paintball obstacle courses hogging the zip line and floating dock at the pond some of these things they got trophies for and other rewards like smores or candy the betrayal one day while me and my buddy were catching frogs out of a pond we heard some girls screaming and running out of their bathroom nearby we run over to them to see whats happening apparently there was a rattlesnake that had slithered its way into one of the stalls so my buddy and i decide hell yeah well take care it be the heroes for the ladies so we pick up some long branches and rocks and start trying to kill the thing well in the loud commotion from the screaming girls a few of the big kids came over and watched as my friend and i battled the elusive serpent a few minutes later were coming out of the bathroom with our slain beast the big kids ganged up on us and took the rattlesnake for their own and showed it off to the rest of the camp as their trophy they got extra smores that nightan exclusive reward pretty much forest cred and made a trophy type thing with the snakes rattler tail wewerefurious this was the last straw the gathering of the clans the next evening at the chow hall my friend and i informed the rest of our teepee what had really happened with the snake incident we all decided something has to be done we wouldnt let the big kids push us around any more one of our teepee brothers was working in the kitchen that evening so when no one was looking he opened the back door to let us in the supply closet my friend and i wrote on a few of the napkins secret meeting tonight blue teepee after chow once we finished writing down our message we went around while plates and things were being passed out and slipped the napkins to each of the teepee leaders of the younger groups about o clock after dinner chow was over and the two older groups had gone left for a night hike all the younger teepees had met up by ours we told them all about the snake thing how they had stolen it from us and claimed all the prizes and glory for their own with this on top of all the other crap we had to put up with from the big kids we were all on the same page with getting revenge our teepee leaders came up with our revenge plan when i think back on it now it was pure genius sun tzu style planning operation moonbeam every year there was an unofficial pillow fight that happens between the teepees its a winner takes all death match any candysmoresextra goodies were taken as prize for the winning teams and with it usually being the last big competition that happened for the summer it was very important to win as your teepee would go down in pillow fight history while the big kids were still gone on their hike and the sun slipping away behind the distant mountains our team leaders had all us kids collect our moonbeamsflashlights as many socks as we could find and our pillows once we had all regrouped they began to lay out the plan our long socks were rolled up in to balls and filled into our pillow cases doing so ensured maximum damage to our opponents next we had one of our fastest kids dressed up in all camouflage go scout out the path where the big kids would be returning from he would walkie talkie back to us when he saw them coming and sprint back to join us from there the rest of us would be hiding on the hill sides that surrounded the teepees with our flashlights and pillows ready once the big kids returned in the dark of night they would be lured into the center of the grounds by our runner who would now be carrying the big kids teepee flag then we attack battle of eversmores the sun had retreated completely from view and the stars rose high into the sky shining even brighter as if excited for the battle to come we got the radio call from our scout and everyone ran to their places scout was now sitting in front of the enemies teepee twirling the flag around when we saw their group marching back to camp upon seeing the little kid in possession of their flag they all started yelling and gave chase exactly as we had hoped in the center of the grounds was a portapotty luckily not one that can be tipped over that our scout ran into as protection from the big kids he was now surrounded by both groups of big kids kicking and yelling for him to come out and get a beating with them all distracted the battle was ready to begin on the hills all around the camp a few dozen flashlights beamed on blinding all the big kids in the center while battle cries rang and children charged from the hills with blood in their eyes and cotton polyester in their hands a fire had been lit earlier to make the surrounding woods seem darker in contrast i wish i could have seen what it looked like from their point of view im sure it was glorious and terrifying all the same within a matter a minutes many of the big kids had already surrendered after taking a beating bodies lit with the orange glowing light of fire and war dropping all around us in the chaos and confusion some ran back to their teepees to find we had tied some of them together rendering the pillows useless it was a good fight not to say we didnt lose a few good men the big kids resorted to pinecones in the few pillows they were able to salvage but alas we eventually won the fight and raided their teepee of all their hershey chocolate marshmallows and gram crackers the rest of the night was spent around the camp fire all us kids enjoying some well earned smores while the big kids had received our kitchen cleaning duties as delicious a revenge it was i was most happy about retrieving my rattle snake tail blue teepee for life 
yeah we all know the exlax revenge to the point where it is a clichebut lets be honest it works first off keep in mind that this would legally count as batteryjust putting that out there typical story years ago i worked in the admin dept of a large university our department handled security and parking operations we had a shared breakroom as most offices do also in typical fashion people began to notice that their lunches went missingand if they did not go completely missing they noticed portions of it had been consumedwhich is even more gross complaints followed but the perp was never identified and the lunch theft continued someone and no it was not me decided to take matters into their own hands the woman who did it owned up to me and gave me the details she made something nice and delicious using a combination of chocolate and of course chocolate exlax brownines she put it in the fridge with a note along the lines of shellys desert please dont touch come lunch time it was missing of course around pm she observed one of the parking enforcement officers a complete moron and loser that nobody liked anyhow making a beeline for the mens room he then asked to leave because by his own graphic admission had a bad case of the shits now i dont know the rest of the details other than the fact that shelly confronted the guy and after that no more lunches were stolen 
i was in an abusive relationship for two years i do not have any type of support from family and my friends cut me off because i did not leave him right after he hit me in the face i was so stupid for not leaving right away two years had passed i finally able to believe in myself again and able to find a steady full time job i slowly drift away from me and started to make new friends again i slowly drift away and he started cheating on me while he was in the bathroom he forgot to lock his iphone and i saw their messages to each other i decided to seek revenge instead of confronting him and then day came when i got my revenge i met up with him in his place so we had some drinks and fortunately he got so drunk that he passed out with my rubber gloves i went to his laptop and went to his facebook so i posted tons of pornographic items i wrote something in his facebook status too stating he is gay and he is sleeping with buddy and that he cannot hide his feelings for him anymore on top of that when i was about to leave i saw a big jar full of weed so i flushed it in the toilet i am not homophobic but he is and i do not smoke weed so that was the last day i saw him he freaked out on me and he mentioned as to why i threw his weed and i told him to call the police on me as if as for the other woman fortunately she works at the womens centre where i went for counselling and she mentioned it to my ex and she also gave him my new address i received a message from my ex and told me he will come see me at my new address so i decided to stay at a hotel the week after i showed the text message to my counsellor and they terminated that woman and she got charged
setting a quiet saturday afternoon lots of rain boredom i was sitting in my room when the doorbell rang not a rare occurrence by any means but it was what happened after that was really interesting my dad opened the door and i peaked out from the banister above the door to see who had come a man greets my father asks him if were selling the car out front turns out even though it doesnt say we are we have been thinking about it for quite some time the man gives us this sob story about his landscaping business and his pregnant wife and how he really needs this a car it seems legit and my initial sketchiness dies down a little he offers my dad k for a truck with miles on it not a horrible offer so my mom begins the required paperwork to hand over the title and make a bill of sale she asks for his id and he hands it to her this is where it gets really interesting my mom was still somewhat sketched out about a random stranger asking to buy a random car in our driveway that isnt for sale it was weird not something that happens every day and she was right she looks up his name online and a massive slew of public documents and news stories about scammers buying high mileage cars and selling them for massive profit after turning back the odometer shows up this man was convicted of a massive fraud ring less than two years ago and is out on probation from federal prison hes at it again i will link the news stories and court public record if allowed i know private information is frowned upon so i will post without it initially mods decided not to allow me to post this info not sure if i agree since it is all public domain and what better revenge then to out these motherfuckers to the fullest it is what it is i guess my mom tells me to go outside and help my dad bail on this deal my dad was outside helping the guy look at the car that shit wouldnt even start ffs and i tell them that my friend has agreed to give us k for it instead and that we were no longer interested he gives me the lip and i basically tell him to fuck off subtly i think they know whats up at this point and i told my dad secretly what was up im a big guy so the intimidation factor may have been enough to scare them off my dad and i walk back inside thinking its over its not over my mom wrote down the mans state id number and his address after contacting the local authorities they told us to contact the attorney generals office and weve taken it upon ourselves to contact the local news station that ran the stories about him updates in the near future are sure to follow 
this is my first post so be kind ive just been reading all of your revenge stories so i just had to contribute my own as far as being bullied goes middle school is the worst time to be a kid regardless of your color creed etc its a time when everyone is just starting puberty and all of this fear and confusion turns kids into cruel and soulless beings so imagine how much more confusing and traumatic it is to be a middle schooler when you are gay and when the most popular insult that gets thrown around in the school yard is faggot anyway i was realizing around then that i was a lesbian id never been popular but always had more guyfriends than girlfriends so my best friend was this kind of slovenly overweight mouthbreathing boy whom i shall refer to as piggy i made the mistake of telling piggy that i thought i was attracted to girls and he spread it all around the school as fast as his little piggy legs could carry him even though no one had known who i was prior to my outing they sure as hell knew who i was then and never forgot to shout abuse at me when i walked by in the lunch room in pe i wound up having to change in the bathroom to spare myself humiliation since all of the other girls avoided me like plauge and were always making loud comments to one and other about how they felt like i was watching them when they changed piggy was one of the people who tormented me the most and it hurt the most coming from him since wed been so tight in elementary school yeah it was a fun three years anyway come high school i thankfully made some new friends after finding my niche in band and people seemed to grow out of name calling to an extent piggy also wound up going to the same high school as did most of our middle school class piggy had a gorgeous sister who ill call lovely lovely was a year younger than piggy was and was a freshman when i was a sophomore lovely played the flute and we saw a lot of each other in band class as well as marching band you see where this is going eh well fast forward to my senior year and lovely and i have become very close friends and by very close i mean i took her to prom and heres the kicker piggy didnt have anyone to take to prom i picked lovely up from piggys house and he was just standing there in a tux looking like a jerk allllll alone while the two of us drove away also you know how piggy was a homophobic prick in middle school well he stayed that way in high school and was constantly spewing his hateful shit on facebook i only know this because lovely was his friend on facebook and if i wanted to i could see his stuff anyway since he had zero privacy settings he didnt want to be associated with gays in any way well lovely and i took heaps of photos at prom together and tagged him in every one of our pictures there were some where we were kissing each other on the cheek and stuff nothing nasty he untagged himself of course but at least he got to know that somewhere out there people were looking at pictures of his own sister which proved that oh no he was connected to a gay person i wish wed screenshotted some of the passiveagressive and not so passive but all out aggressive facebook posts he made afterwards its really rough trying to play nice when youve been victimized in some way and sometimes being mean is actually kind of awesome as this wonderful place has shown me but in many cases revenge just isnt an option and it feels pretty good to just survive and let your happiness be a big fck you to the ones who tried to screw with you as tempting as it is to consider asking lovely for piggys email and signing him up for every gayporn site imaginable i dont feel that it is necessary now ive won lovely and i are still friends now though i went out of state for college piggy stayed home and went to community college and last i heard is still driven to school by his mother i think the best part of my revenge is the fact that it wasnt done deliberately at all life just decided id had enough shit and gave me a karmic pat on the back while giving piggy a karmic kick in the behind tldr i was outed as a lesbian in middle school by my socalled best friend and wound up dating his sister in high school
this is my brothers revenge story he was working for a software company in early s or so this is when companies were writing all kinds of programs to see what would sell there was a guy who was a friend of all the programmers there we will call him jimbob jimbob was allowed to use the software they were programming as he was their bud and all this had been going on for sometime then they found out he was selling the software behind their backs did they confront him nope did they stop lending him the software big nope in fact they made sure he always got whatever new software they came up with this went on for several months where is the revenge you ask wellthey included a little extra code with all the software they let him try when he made copies and sold the software the little extra code went with it now this little bit of code was not included in the legal copies what did the code do you ask oh nothing much just wiped the harddrive and put a bouncing pumpkin on the screen that laughed at you and if you cleaned your harddrive and reinstalled the software it would automatically go off as the start date had passed when did it go off you ask why on halloween of course he called them the next day about it their response everybody who has a legal copy of our software is having no problems whatsoever and that is when he realized he had been busted he never asked for another piece of software from them ever again 
picky nosy neighbors who have the president of the local homeowners association on speeddial are a real nuisance one day a few years ago my faithful old volvo gave up the ghost the automatic transmission was slowly going out the final blow was when an oil line to an external oil filter developed a pinhole leak and the engine seized when all the oil escaped i had the car towed home and it sat in the driveway for a month or so while i tried to decide what to do with it the options being to replace both the engine and transmission or sell it off cheap either for parts or to someone who wanted to get it running again i finally reluctantly decided to let it go id miss it as it had been probably the best car id ever had and id done some serious upgrades amp improvement to it about this time my neighbor called the hoa to complain that i had a junk car in the driveway that i was parting out to hear her version the president expected to see something on cinder blocks with no doors the hood up and no engine the truth was that it was still intact with current license plates and insurance there was no way to tell from looking at it that it wasnt running nevertheless i was given one week to either fix the car or have it gone the busybody neighbor was known for being extremely conservative she made teabaggers seem middleoftheroad one of the things which she had a particular dislike for was the local npr radio station which was associated with a local university the station was running a fundraiser at the time so i decided to kill two birds with one stone i donated the car to the radio station the appointed saturday came around and the car was being picked up by a tow truck when she came out to watch the proceedings with a smug look she commented to me that it was about time that piece of junk was being removed when i replied that id donated it to the local npr station her smug look was instantly replaced by horror quickly followed by livid anger she stalked back into her house and slammed the door i was happy that even to the last my trusty volvo had been useful edit spelling
payback is a bitch for abortion clinic protestors thanks to a brilliant landlord todd stave has the unenviable position of being the landlord of a building in germantown maryland which he leases to an abortion provider called reproductive health services clinic so he knows a little something about dealing patiently with antiabortion protesters but when they started calling him at home at all hours and harassing his family he got fed up and came up with a very clever solution do unto others as they have been doing unto you problems really began for stave at the end of when he leased his building to leroy carhart one of the only doctors in the us who openly acknowledges that he performs lateterm abortions as you can imagine hes a controversial man and protesters come from far and wide there is a constant group of them parked outside praying and holding up signs many of which have pictures of mangled fetuses thats pretty much a landlords nightmare and yet stave has a very calm attitude about it he told petula dvorak of the washington post this week its their right they are protected by the first amendment and outside the clinic is probably the most appropriate place for them to express their views if youre wondering how stave can remain so relaxed about the situation he explains ive been a member of this fight since roe v wade since i was years old you see the clinic used to belong to his father and then his sister ran it when he was younger the office was firebombed and protesters were often gathered outside his dads house so hes used to a certain level of harassment and hell tolerate it but only up to a point and recently the usually calm cool and collected stave was pushed to his limit its common practice for antiabortion protesters to disseminate doctors personal information and urge people to harass themand it can clearly go far beyond that as with the murder of dr george tiller in kansas leroy carhart whos now in staves clinic had his nebraska farm burned to the ground back in but protesters in maryland figured out they could start targeting stave for owning the clinics property he was largely unfazed by this campaign until last fall when they took it too far on his daughters first day in middle school a large group of people protested outside her school and then they showed up again for backtoschool night they were naturally carrying signs with his name and contact info and those nasty pictures of fetuses stave was furious and then it got even worse dozens of the protestors began calling him at home around the clock his friends wanted to help him fight back thats when stave had the brilliant idea of turning the tables on his tormentors he began recording the names and numbers of the assholes who called and then he gave the list of info to his friends and asked them to call these people back on his behalf shazam and the really smart part was that when someone from team stave called they always took the high road he explains in a very calm very respectful voice they said that the stave family thanks you for your prayers they cannot terminate the lease and they do not want to they support womens rights genius while it was initially only a few friends doing the calling the group quickly expanded soon he was up to having callers at his disposal and they got crafty too theyd look up information on the people whod placed unwanted calls to stave and then when they called theyd drop the names of the persons children or their school into the conversation theyd also said stave tell them that we bless their home on such and such street and then name their address are you getting shivers up youre spine yet staves calling force became so powerful that sometimes he was able to hammer an unwanted caller with up to calls in return looks like two can play at this game stalkers staves approach was so appealing that he was flooded with people from all over wanting to help so he organized voice of choice which now has about volunteers they dont just fight back for stave anymore theyll make calls on behalf of whoever is being bullied by antiabortion protesters whether its a doctor or a landlord or their family when asked if he thought this method of payback was harsh stave said no we gave them back what they gave us actually not even you gave back a mild familyfriendly version of what they gave to you you proved to them that you know where they live and who their children are but you didnt show up at their homes and schools and threaten them you didnt come onto their lawn with posters detailing terrible imaginary things that theyve done youre serving up revenge lite tastes great less killing whats more stave is strict about who voice of choice will make calls for if its just runofthemill protests outside clinics he wont help them because he believes in peoples first amendment right to be out there saying whats on their mind protestors must be personally harassing doctors or landlords in order for stave to step in if only abortion opponents had the same respect for people doing what they were allowed by law to do ahem so this is the part where the evil bullies whove plagued him and others at all hours of the day or night learn their lesson after having a taste of their own medicine right yep yep they all realized they were being horrible and now every antiabortion protester is treating their prochoice opponents with the utmost respect ha no actually this is the part in the story where it gets much worse ready since voice of choice has been such a success stave was honored by naral in california last week knowing that he was going to be out of town receiving the award his personal band of haters chose that moment to canvass his neighborhood with fliers that had a photo of stave in a nazi uniform photos of holocaust victims and bloody fetuses pause for a brief ragestroke intermission of course the fliers had staves contact informationand all of the phone numbers and addresses for other members of his family this goes without saying but nevertheless this is so incredibly fucked up first of all the guy owns a building not a concentration camp second of all what kind of person picks up a flier like that and thinks i need to get in touch with this nazi god help us all obviously staves daughter and all of his neighbors saw the fliers but the contact information for staves family members must have been spread around because on monday an abortion protestor showed up at the dental office owned by staves brotherinlaw and began doing his abortionprotestor routine outside thats such a great idea im sure the random patient walking in for a cleaning is totally going to make the connection that the dentists brotherinlaw owns a building where theres an abortion clinic and therefore abortion is wrong at this point stave was back in town so he went over to confront the protestor and when he got there the creep said how was your trip to san francisco deep inhale slow exhale it is amazing that people like stave have fortitude to stand up to psychos like this coming at them from every direction but thank heavens they do because honestly the thought that these protesters get away with so much is sickening its hard to know where these nutcases will end when it comes to making staves life a living hellbut its probably not going to get any better now that hes getting more and more national media attention at least we know hes got plenty of backup from voice of choice the worse these people get the longer voc can keep them on the phone telling them all about the many blessings and prayers theyre sending to their home addresses and to the locations of their childrens daycare centers then everyone will be so busy making and receiving calls that theyll have less time to spend protesting outside clinics and maybe in the future well get to a magical place where both sides are talking to each other percent of the time and a woman will be able to walk right up to the front door of an abortion clinic without being harassedbecause everyone will be so busy talking on the phone to their enemies to notice or care what shes choosing to do with her

edit theres a lot of debate about this being pro or not this was my first post and first time in this subreddit i already copied it to petty revenge the only reason i havent taken it off here is because its clear a large enough audience enjoyed the story youre free to downupvote all you want but please stop arguing amongst yourselves thank you i want to start off saying i gave up on revenge long ago and adopted the dont wish bad on others wish good on yourself philosophy as if your wish comes true one benefits you while the others worthless that being said heres one of my last acts of revenge from freshman year of college years ago my dorm was a story brownstone i lived in a double on the first floor and had a quad and triple of freshman above me i admittedly was a little intense my first semester of college but i always tried to make friends rather than problems for whatever reason all the other freshman in the dorm started to shun and exclude me except my roommate it was really lonely and i felt really unwanted and fucking insecure all the time it got to the point they didnt talk to me or go near my room if i was there march of that year i went home for a weekend when i came back i found my cookie crisp was gone i bought cereal for breakfast as it wasnt included in my meal plan it was all i had in the morning and my tissue box was empty that still creeps me the fuck out my roommate told me it was the freshman who shunned me i calmly went to ask about it and ask why and they immediately put on angry faces told me to calm down and they would replace it that night well hours pass and they didnt leave the school store was closing soon so i went up stairs and politely asked jimmy the guy the douches all followed if he could please go soon so i would have breakfast in the morning he grumbles and says ok another hour passes and the stores close to closing nobody went i politely ask again and jimmy says im not going and im not going to let you harass me into it well thats nice but thats not the decision you made when you ate my breakfast what do you mean breakfast what time you wake up what time is your class why dont you eat in the cafeteria none of these questions matter you ate it you replace it he stomps off into his room at this point i stop being forgiving and know what to do ok jimmyim gonna take a shower the douchebag left all his toiletries in the bathroom which was a small one toilet one bathtub bathroom for college dude i got in for my shower and proceeded to piss in his yellow shampoo and then as quickly as i could move jizz in his conditioner on his hand soap and face bar in his toothpaste it was hard to make sure i got it everywhere and no clear signs of it but i got it to work i didnt tell a soul for a year and i dont think i told anyone about the toothpaste for a little longer i didnt care if he mouthed off to me afterwards i already ruined it for him tldr mufugga stole my cookie crisp so i jizzed in his toothpaste 
the background so this is back around i grew up in a pretty cool neighborhood but we had that one house you know the one with the elderly couple with not a god damn thing to do they did all the typical stay off my lawn bs where i felt they took it to a new level however is when my friends and i were playing ball they would wait in the garage one would peek through the window and the other had their hand on the button so as soon as a ball started rolling in the direction of their house the door starts opening and here comes oldster to steal it it got to the point that one of my buddies sprinted over there and kicked the ball away as the guy was bent over to pick it up he didnt like that tried to accuse everyone of assault he also called the police each time he stole one of our balls this despite them repeatedly telling him that a ball rolling over your lawn is not trespassing but taking it is stealing the incident up until now they were annoying but not much else at the time i had the most awesome dog tiger he was a stray that came to live with us a few years earlier but he still liked to wander a lot too just as dogs are want to do and at the time letting your dog out was still common well my neighbor would call the dog warden every day not because he was shitting or pissing or digging up his lawn because he walked through it thats it so eventually it comes down to we need to fence in the dog or lose him we build a fence all the way around the property just so tiger can houdini his way out again and again he was a super cool freakin ninja dog long story short he kept finding new ways to get out because thats how he wanted to live and it resulted in us loosing him for good i was apoplectic i genuinely wanted to murder the old bastards i eventually came to my senses and resolved to ruin what he loved instead the revenge they absolutely worshiped their stupid grass he cut it times per week watered it daily you will think i am joking but i am in the ne of the us and he had a second snow blower that he set up to get the snow off the lawn with out tearing out the grass ridiculous costco was new at the time and my dad didnt pay much attention to the stuff we threw into the cart so that is how i came to be in possession of lbs of salt we were leaving for a week at the shore the next morning so about am i was spreading salt it took a few days to kill the grass so i was a few hundred miles away when asshole appeared in foot tall letters extremely visible from the street by the time i got back he had resodded the whole thing luckily friends had taken pictures of the lawn and themselves giving thumbs up from the sidewalk i can still picture old man n watching that photoshoot through the garage window in my mind it is akin to hector with lots of lip quivering impotent rage and spittle edit love how much discussion something i did years ago when i was can create to clarify the dog did not run away he was sent to live on a farm aka put down this is the only dog i didnt raise from a pup as i said tiger was a street dog that took us in more than we took him in picture tramp from the disney movie we were lucky enough that he liked hanging out with us i do train any animal that i am keeping as a pet this dog had his own separate identity above and beyond that that is why he was so awesome he didnt need us he was with us because he wanted to be edit how has nobody even referenced using a snow blower on the lawn yet i thought that was the craziest part of the story i am serious that he would spend an insane amount of time every snowstorm clearing off what was about a x front lawn 
i was in class a few years ago and the little shit behind me was poking and kicking my seat i was fairly quiet in class he was not so i turned around while everyone was taking notes and the teacher was writing on the board picked up his text book threw it across the room and it slammed off the floor i quickly went back to writing before the book hit the ground so there he was no book and no one buying his story about me doing it and he gets sent to the principals office
back in college i met a girl through my classes we became fwb she would often come over to my apartment to work on stuff together a couple months later found out she was bad mouthing me to my roommate who she was trying to hook up with i ended up breaking things off with her but kept her added on facebook i find out that she is getting an engaged to another indian guy she was indian herself i ended up adding her fiance started talking to him turns out he was under the assumption his precious fiance was a virgin i told him that i had sex with her he asked her she completely denied it and he ended up deleting me afterwards turns out my roommate who bad mouthed me still had naked pictures of her i ended up sending them through a fake facebook account to him found out a bit later that they ended breaking up i dont know i actually feel good about it told a few of my friends all my female friends said i was an asshole while my guy friends think i did the right thing now i know many people might not agree with indian culture about virginity and all and thats perfectly fine but to this guy it meant a good bit he saved himself for marriage and expected his wife to had done the same you can say when she was younger she experimented and all but if that is the case she should have told him and let him judge whether he wanted to stay or not instead she lied to him and wanted to marry him under false pretenses i know i wasnt doing it out of a good heart but that being said can we say that i did the right thing for the wrong reason if you were the guy wouldnt you want to know call me an asshole but if she gets engaged to another traditional indian guy i will definitely tell him too edit for those of you saying that indian culture is so repressive and misogynistic am i not doing her a favor saving her from such a chauvinistic culture if she has to lie about her virginity to a guy because he wont accept her otherwise is it true love i am saving her from a life time with a guy that doesnt value her that way she can find a more sex positive guy 
so heres the deal i go to school at wvu im a medical student and i live in a building that is minutes from the hospital its a nice building and every apartment has at least a full bedroom and a living room each floor has a boys bathroom and a girls bathroom and each consists of a number of stalls along with or showers due to policy and at the request of other occupants the buildings only cameras are out front and in the back lately theres been this guy going around and taking shits in the showers the first time it happened it was on the second floor i live on the fifth a student walked in early in the morning before class and said that it was right over the drain personally i found this to be incredibly funny and thought nothing of it assuming it was a onetime prank the following tuesday on the sixth floor it happened again needless to say us students didnt find it as funny this time around from this point on everybody was extremely cautious when stepping into the showers on thursday it happened once more this time was different though it happened on my floor to be more specific it happened to me when i stepped into the shower i was not lucky enough to see it before i stepped in it this was becoming personal i was so pissed that i even called the staff to complain they said that since we didnt know who it was and due to the nocamera policy they couldnt do anything about it at the time i then took it upon myself to find a solution i spent the next week planning my revenge throughout this week the showershit had become more frequent it happened almost every day i figured it had to be someone in the building because according to the building staff no one had been coming inandout every day who was not a resident eventually i had narrowed it down to two revenge plans wait it out let somebody else handle it then extract my revenge later on whoever did this the problem with this plan was that whoever did it was sure to be expelledsuspended at least kicked out of the building i wanted to either be the cause of this or make this awful person suffer more i was going to find out who the midnight shitter was and turn him in after i had executed whatever i was going to do to this monster i decided to go with option and the problem now was how to find out how to catch the person i could try a camera but that would be an invasion of both building policy and the law you cannot but a camera in a bathroom the other option was to gather several of other occupants who i knew could not be the shitter and stand guard outside the bathrooms once again i went with option two me and twelve residents stood outside the bathrooms on each floor and pretended to be texting there were six floors and we each took shifts throughout the night whoever was the shitter must have heard of our plans because nothing had happened for the first two nights of doing this on the third night however my luck skyrocketed i saw a student go into the bathroom i was watching he was on my floor but i didnt talk to him he was new and he had recently transferred from uga he walked in and i waited no shower sounds no toilet flushing i peeked into the bathroom slightly and looked no one was in the stall i then slowly scoped the outside of the showers until i saw a small shadow inside the last one i had finally found this man since he was on my floor i knew all about the guy we will call him jim jim was a man of indian decent he had several friends who i knew of and both were in classes with me the next monday i approached one of them i explained my whole situation and we hatched a plan together the plan was that this friend was going to spend the night at jims place then let me in when jim was asleep i was then going to enter with bags of cow manure and pour them all over the apartment then in the morning i was going to report him to the proper authorities surprisingly enough my whole plan worked and he was evicted from the building tldr this guy at my college shits in all the showers so me and another guy put cow manure in his apartment then report him
ok so heres the thing when i moved to australia about years ago i was now and had no friends this was understandable but the sad part was that noone wanted to be my friend i did everything wrong i sat with the wrong posture i said the wrong thing i acted like a year old when something serious was going on i acted like a year old when some game was happening every little thing just went wrong for me then this amazing person became my friend ill call her sophie coldfish to protect her identity because that would be going a little far anyway sophie was my first real friend here and i met her after easily years with literally not a single friend in the hemisphere we did pretty much everything together and later she introduced me to her own friends and we very quickly bonded now this was fine for about years i had a great best friend who was warm and friendly to me and i had a great group of new friends who were interested in science fiction and classic literature and all the other nerdy things i liked and then i got my diagnosis of autism this wasnt something i bandied about or anything i kept this information close to my chest telling only the people i thought i could trust most in the world apparently this did not extend to my best friend little miss coldfish she went screaming about how i was a freak a liar a retard and a pervert where did she get that one from and yes all of these and more were her actual words it got so bad i tried to kill myself on three separate occasions it turned out she had a serious problem with anyone she perceived as mentally ill and held virtually neonazi views about what should be done with mentally disabled people i vowed absolute total revenge on this bitch who had ruined my carefullyconstructed life we ended up sparring a little mostly verbally until after about months of this we just sort of lapsed into furious silence she should have remembered that i was the winner of the prize for science in my school for years running after about more months i got really sick of her shit i still had my old friends from before but my former best friend was now my absolute nemesis i trusted her with everything and now she was using that against me telling people i was bigender hey did you know the nutjob is a faggot too that i had tourettes yeah like that retard on youtube and that i liked star trek and old scifi movies and things what a fucking nerdy bitch i found my way onto ebay and bought ounces of pure iodine crystals i then went to the local shops and got some disposable pitchers and a few bottles of ammonium if you mix these up in a certain ratio you get a highly volatile chemical called nitrogen triiodide this is also known as explosive paint later that night i went to her house and painted this stuff around her door handle her door is one of the ones where if you turn the handle on one side the other turns too i also painted it under the wheels of her car and under her welcome mat since nitrogen triiodide will explode with a small amount of force and a terrifyingly loud bang when touched or moved leaving an indelible yellow stain this might be quite interesting fast forward a little i come back four days later theres a deep yellow stain on the door handle and on her driveway two of her tyres have the same mark two others look new i later found out from a coworker of hers that they burst for some reason turning over her mat there are deep yellow and black scorchmarks in it i did this again only this time on her bike wheels and under her window which i heard from her boyfriend had been replaced very expensively since she thought she broke it because of the cracking sound a week later shell never know it was me specifically but i have a fair idea shes stopped calling me names in the street which is something and i may even have the restraining order metres lifted if she keeps up this enforced good behaviour
this was a couple years back the drummer of this band we shared our practice space with accused us of cutting him short on our portion of the rent which we definitely hadnt he emailed us saying we now owe two months rent and that he was friends with the building manager who could kick us out he didnt we told him we knew he was full of shit to which he challenged us to a fight in the park because thats what adults do we decided it was sketchy to just leave our gear in that room where they could get to it so we drove down that day to move it all out we get there and there are two new padlocks on the door bad move we come back at am and cut the locks off with bolt cutters we get in and grab our gear i knew the drummer hides a bottle of inside his kick drum through the front hole so i get it out and proceed to top it off with a nice minute long piss that id been holding on the bart ride over and then put it back i then overtightened all the bottom heads of his drums for good measure finally we installed a new door handle and locked it from the inside and three new padlocks on the outside we heard from a friend in a band in a spot down the hall that it took their drunk asses two weeks to get their shit together enough to get back in there im pretty sure he drank that piss rum too because smells much stronger and is much darker theres no way he couldve known but we do and now you do and thats all that matters 
after reading usebbonls tale of pwning a scumbag driver it inspired me to tell you guys about a very similar tale that happened to myself and my so one afternoon a few months ago my so is with an open license but currently no car he grew up working on cars with his dad and has had more carrelated jobs from rentals to detailing to mechanics than i can count he loves cars and knows more about them than anyone ive ever met he has owned many cars and is a skilled but mostly responsible driver he has a friend who is young and does not yet have a license but had recently gotten a supposedly great deal on a kinda junky looking bmw no idea what kind im a chick and i dont know jack about cars which he lent to my so for a few days to run errands since without a license he cant drive it anyway so my so comes over with the car one day after offering to take me to an appointment when we go downstairs we both have a laugh at it it has a terrible patchy paint job a huge crappy wing hanging off it and those stupid rear window decals from car accessory manufacturers that losers think will make them go faster it screams bogan street cred its quite nice on the inside though tan leather interior and everything and my so tells me that his friend did in fact get a good deal as the car has low mileage and is in great working condition i was also surprised to learn that its zippy as fuck on the way back from my appointment were cruising down the highway theres about lanes going in each direction and every few hundred metres or so theres a steel arch that goes over the road with digital led speed signs hanging down iirc the speed limit was set to kph which is normal considering it was a quiet afternoon with not a whole lot of cars on the road and the only one near us was a dark blue sedan just ahead in the lane left of us were just chilling listening to the radio with the windows down when a white midtolate s holden commodore aussies will see where this is going passes us on the right we dont notice them at this point but when they get about two car lengths ahead of us we see arms protruding from the left side of the vehicle and motioning at the blue sedan the blue cars windows are rolled down but nothing seems to be happening so the commodore moves into our lane to drive alongside them an arm comes out of the holdens passenger side window waving an unopened can of xxxx gold now for nonaussies xxxx gold and commodores are both huge bogan identifiers and go together like coloured mohawks and tartan pants go with punk kids you see the two things together and can usually conclude with about accuracy that the owner of those things is a bogan anyway at this point it has become clear that the blue sedan is carrying a number of women and the guy in the holdens passenger seat is offering the lady driver a beer thankfully its not working the women merge into the lane to their left and hang back to escape the holden dangerously follows but not before chucking an empty tinny out the window at this point my so decides to intervene we also move to the left with the holden in front of us and the sedan to our left the women look a bit scared and again change lanes to their left so we take their spot and speed up til were alongside the holden again they realise what theyve gotten into and now move to the right to escape us we follow at this point almost all of the traffic is in the left lanes and were in the right lanes we look over at them and the passenger assesses our swagmobile and flips us off right as the driver plants his foot on the accelerator theres no one ahead of us and my so looks at me and says watch this this little beema knew how to go and go it did we sped right up past them and made sure to be only just ahead of them they seemed surprised by our swift acceleration and would get faster and faster to try and catch up but we made sure to always stay juuuust in front at just over kph we pull back slightly and quickly move into the clear left lane as i previously mentioned it was a quiet afternoon and so there was a fair distance between cars in the busier lanes we pull back some more and duck to the left again then again and then one last time as we resume cruising at the speed limit assimilated with all the other cars as this is happening we see the holden continuing to hurtle along at top speed apparently unaware that we were no longer trying to tail them now my so is quite competitive and i know he would never give up that easily especially where cars are concerned i ask him why he let the guy go and he replies babe you know ive been driving around here a long time i know this road like the back of my hand i also know exactly which of those led speed signs hanging overhead have hidden speed cameras behind them i just gave them a little coaxing now theyll be receiving a nice little present in the mail sure enough we had levelled out just before the camera while the dbags had shot straight through it tldr possibly drink driving bogans litter and scare women on the highway get tricked into going kph through speed camera edit formatting
first off sorry for the amount of text so this all happened a few years ago in sixth form this guy had pulled a few pranks on me nothing spectacular just stuff like filling my bag with dry leaves taking the ink out my pens etc i knew i had to get him back so i devised a diabolical plan now a little background info there were loads of lockers in my school far too many in fact and so there were always a lot of lockers free so with more padlocks you could just take more lockers other background is that we both had double chemistry on wednesday mornings and completely free afternoons oh and also this guy cycled to school and got changed and left his things in his locker now for the revenge stage one i started preparing the friday before the planned revenge on the following wednesday i did so by bringing every single padlock that i could find into college and taking as many lockers spread as far around the school as possible especially targeting numbers with some significance to them like etc stage two i began writing riddles about of them they were no literary masterpieces but i tried my hardest to make them challenging rhyme and require knowledge of all things spanning literature art classical history science and incorporate anagrams and cryptic clues also the answer to each clue gave the location or number of a locker except one which led to a person who had the next riddle on him i had made sure that the intended victim and the riddle holder had never before met stage three i put each riddle and the key to the next locker in an envelope with a large question mark printed on it and then put these in the corresponding lockers the day before the prank all was now in place for the prank to go smoothly stage four prank day is now upon us i make sure to walk to chemistry with the victim and remind him we need to get our lab coats from our lockers this ensures the last time he sees his locker full he is with me we walk up to chemistry i have arranged for a friend of mine to forget his lab coat so he has to go down and get his from his locker he goes down to get but quickly takes all the stuff from the victims locker puts it in another places the first riddle in the victims locker and relocks it he then returned to the chemistry locker stage five the chemistry lesson is over i return with the victim to our lockers to put our labcoats away but wait whats this all his stuff his gone o no what a surprise he doesnt know whats happened he reads the riddle the gravity of the situation hits him mwhahahaaa i can see the cogs whirring around in his head about even the first riddle i make my excuses and go home at this point its about o clock and leave my victim to search for his stuff with a few of his friends trying to help him the aftermath i return to school the following day to find that the riddled chap didnt manage to find his stuff until just after in the evening and boy o boy is he mad especially as his stuff was in the locker next to his with the pretty difficult code hes got a few suspects and unfortunately one of them is me i remind him that it couldnt possibly be me as i was with him the whole time but go ahead with revenge against a particularly douchey mcdoucherson whom is also a suspect by surreptitiously planting a question mark envelope in his bag now my riddled victim has decided to just look through his prime suspects bags and lo and behold what should he find but evidence of the crime in douchey mcdouchersons bag so now victim a is furious with victim b and swears revenge upon him for the rest of the year he was merciless with douchey mcdoucherson tldr intricate web of riddles leads prankster on hour search for his belongings and carefully planted evidence results in douchey mcdoucherson taking the blame for some in revenge
so i used to work for hallmark when i was and there was this one guy there who was the biggest douchebro ive ever met i mean he dressed and acted like someone from the jersey shore this was before the jersey shore so i guess in his own way he was a hipster too and he carried this knife that he kept in a holster under his armpit like a detective might carry his gun now despite working with boxes all day the only time i ever saw him use it was to cut your drink bottle very finely so as you didnt notice the hole untill you went to take a sip and got covered in cola or whatever it was that you were drinking well he did that to me one too many times and i thought right im going to fix this prick so i grabbed a whole bunch of david hasslehoff cards he was wearing jeans laying down with no shirt and proceeded to plaster the passenger side and rear of the car with them along with slogans such as i the cock and honk if you take it up the arse i feel i have to mention that i have no problems with lgbt people but knew he did so anyway he drives off without seeing them and the next day he gets into work and is looking for blood apparently these other guys started honking their horn and pointing and laughing at him at which point douchebro starts tilting his at them you know the universal douchebro gesture for come on then any way basicly hes copping it the whole way home and when he gets back to his parents house his familys on the porch and they all start laughing at him at this point he turns around to view my handywork and just loses it it was alot of fun watching him stomp around the factory trying to figure out who was responsible but he never did this next story isnt my personal revenge it was more like the universes revenge against this same douchebro so anyways every wednesday all the young turks in the factory would go down the local for a couple of drinks and to play texas hold em but this one day we ended up far drunker then normal and i was spilling my drinks everywhere so i decided to head home so im doing the rounds saying goodbye to everybody when i spot the douchebro up ordering a drink at the bar i get there just as the douchebro gets his drink and sparks up a smoke now this was like a week after the ban on smoking in bars came into effect so the bartender asks him nice as pie to take it out in the beer garden he didnt even ask him to put it out to which dudebro responds with fuck you you dog cunt at this point ive taken like six steps back and am fully in the we got a badass here pose and decide to get while the goings good so i go over the road to hungry jacks and order a whopper as im sitting at the counter drunkenly munching on my burger when i spot at least cop cars and a divi van pull into the pub across road i know this has somthing to do with the douchebro so i head back across the road and arrive just in time to witness douchebro getting chucked in the back of the divisional van hehe i then head back inside to see what happened apparently douchebro got asked to leave by one of the bouncers and he flashed his knife the one in the holster and told him to fuck off and then thought he could keep playing poker like they werent going to call the cops so douchebro gets into work an hour late the next day with the biggest black eye youve ever seen and asks all the guys not to say what had happened we were all like youre too late we told that guy and him and him douchebro turned red and walked out and we never saw him again oh and the best part was that he was studying to be a pe teacher but as he got charged with making threats to kill carrying a concealed weapon and a whole other bunch of charges which would ensure he would never pass a working with childrens check he basicly flushed all that down the toilet
this story may be a little longer for which i apologize but there is a small back story that is needed to fully explain why i went so far in my revenge i should also say for those grossed out easily or equally offended easily maybe dont keep reading although this seems to be an subreddit of epic revenges so im in the right place some years ago i moved into a small apartment with an old friend when my partner and i fell on hard times i should also mention that my partner was chronically ill and i was effectively a carer for her while working fulltime to support us and studying fulltime needless to say i was stressed the friend who was also a old high school girlfriend whom ill refer to as cc for crazy cunt had accepted that we move in on short notice due to a previous housemate almost killing my partner the week before through negligence there were warning signs i should have spotted on moving in with cc but frankly we were that grateful for a roof over our head that i overlooked them thus follows events that occurred that built up the rage that lead to revenge over the following months when moving into the house i personally had done all the lifting and shifting of ccs stuff out of rooms so could move my stuff in then moved in every item of furniture myself you might say fair enough as shes letting me in but this is up flights of stairs fridges washing machine couches u get the idea not one bit of help even on the small stuff cc was also a crazy cat lady she had a cat she was not allowed to have this thing was also fucking feral if this cat was spotted on the windows or any door was even cracked slightly where the cat could get out or if she thought it was she would go fucking ballistic daily occurrence but more about the cat later moving in i took over of the rent and yet cc intentionally monopolized the only common areakitchen with her druggie boyfriend at any time she was not at work in this common room she would play romantic shitty movies at loud volume yet the tiny offshoot room see wardrobe i used as a study even listening to something at talking volume was apparently too loud for her and would constantly have a go about it this cat would attack you at any chance it had teeth and claws yet cc thought this was cat just being friendly and would blame us for scaring it still have scars from that fucking thing cc was the laziest dirtiest bitch ive ever known this was shown through two things the first was that myself and partner took a two week holiday camping at some point before we left we had asked her to clean the mass of dishes she had created and take out the single bag of garbage that was starting to smell funny weeks is enough time right we got home and opened the door of the apartment and the smellwasatrocious the original bag was still there with full bags of rotting junk food and meat there was also not a clean dish in the house with it all piled up on the sink upon getting back she was hungover on the couch with her idiot boyfriend and expected us to clean it up for her cc had complained non stop about how much of a horrible housemate her previous shared living people had been all of them this raised alarm bells but i should have realized how much cc had vendettas against all of them and intentionally fucked with them and their lives whenever she could this we found out when my partner borrowed ccs contact solution and it immediately burnt her eyes a previous tenant had added dishwashing soap to try and get revenge on cc the cat she never changed the kitty litter and what she fed that damned thing stank when it came out this was in a tiny apartment with the litter box in the shared and cramped toiletshower most showers would be spent gagging and dry wretching despite repeated requests to fix it cc would carry on like a petulant teenager and rarely do anything about it also more about this later the usual stories of shitty housemates of stealing food and clothing items andor selling them to pay for getting pissedhigh on the weekend applied as well so after just under months we had had enough there was more but those are the easiest to explain it would probably be double the length if i covered everything so a plan was formed we were going to wait for her to go out to work for the day them move out in style as soon as she was gone we pulled the trailer around and started loading up all our furniture this was also when we started discovering some things at some point cc had set fire to and burnt all of our tea towels strange but thats what we found as well as that she had not been putting the kitty litter in the bin after all instead she had been bagging it and then double bagging it and then pulling it all in a l tub in the same bathroom had moved it maybe a metre which explained why the smell never ever left the room let alone the apartment she had spent a time telling us it was old clothes she was storing so first of all we called up ccs rental agency and told them we would be moving out and it turned out she had never informed them we were moving in nor about any of the previous tenants this was a major breach of her contract which was effectively guaranteed she was going to be evicted no matter what but we decided to add photos and video of the cat she had and playing with the cat which meant she had broken her contract further meaning she copt a fine to clean and sanitize the apartment following her eviction it was satisfying knowing that she had been in there for years but this was not where it ended she was fairly randy especially after a weekend at a rave and would flaunt how much she was having with her boyfriend and her fetishes while she knew i barely had time for my girl supporting us knowing she had a draw full of sex toys i wasmean if any of you are familiar with a product called blairs hot sauce youve got an idea of where im going i used the one known as ultra death putting a thin coating over her larger toys that she would brag about often this stuff was pretty potent needless to say she was going to be in for a shock next time it was happy time i wish i could say this was where the story ended cc tried to get revenge months later by sending pics of a pregnant belly to my girl with personal information as if i had cheated and knocked someone up fortunately my girl saw through it immediately so in return my girl who worked for major utility company got ccs power cut at her new address and kept it disabled for weeks caught up in red tape that all seemed totally legitimate tldr crazy housemate fucks with myself and my girl and lives in a disgusting fashion gets her evicted sex toys coated in hot chilli for that extra warming sensation and power cut for weeks edit tired of the constant messages claiming falsehood and embellishment if your so certain its false read the comments that bad up the facts you might think you can see through im not going to write every single detail it would get in the way of telling a straight forward story 
when my father was in the army he lived in onbase government barracks sort of like apartments one of the guys in his building would make a ton of racket every morning very early with his motorcycle he would rev it loudly for a solid minutes before leaving he had been asked by others not to do this but he ignored them all so one night my dad got out there with some wire clippers and clipped every electrical wire on that motorcycle that he could find at both ends removing the cables he clipped out as he went along the bike looked fine but naturally all exposed wiring was missing he never heard that guy revving his motorcycle again he knows it was repaired but the guy finally got the message
i had passive aggressive room mates when i was in my trades training in the military they usually have a course room together to a room so that they can study together help each other out and generally build some esprit de corpe our course was odd numbered so there was only on our course in the room and guy from my trade in our room but his course was just finishing he was a good guy and i got along great with him my room mates were passive aggressive douche bags who hated him passive aggressive putting their bed space and furniture together with the tv and stereo on their side facing them so neither he nor i could see the tv or turn down the volume or even use the stereo when they werent around whereas everyone else sharing rooms shared their gear and equipment he and i were smokers and the douches werent this guy smoked two packs a day to my one and thats why they hated him they whined and cried to our course mom nco in charge of anything we needed as to admin or leave requests etc and he was removed got a new room mate a guy i was friends with that went through basic with me he didnt believe the shit i told him about these two until he moved in and saw how they had arranged the room again they hated him because he told them to shut the fuck up when they cried at him about coming in late from a night exercise and waking them by mistake i couldnt tell them off since they were in my class but he could and he never took their shit again to the course mom and boom he is gone now it is just the three of us they focused their crap on me and i just let it slide i would go to sleep and they would turn on the tv loud i would be studying and they would crank the stereo to s pop rock which i hated they would accidentally spill stuff on my clean uniform while i was out so i would have to rewash it an hour before inspection they finally pissed me off when the divoted the act of scuffing the black polish off the leather so it is raw brown leather my parade boots that i had spent over hours polishing for the rcaf anniversary parade again they claimed it was an accident they both went to one of their parents places over a long weekend and i went to work never fuck with the top of your class in an electronics trade i took their stereo amp and tv to the crs communications radar systems lab and rebuilt the power amps on the volume and power amp for the stereo amp and tv from db down to db then i sealed it all up and returned them to the room since all of my course was from the same province as my base was located in they were all gone and no one saw me take or return the stuff to the barracks when they returned they couldnt figure out what was wrong since the factory seals were in place and the stuff was in the exact same position when they left at the same time i had bought a ghetto boom box with a capital g that pumped out a booming db and started playing pink floyd as loud as it would go followed up with deep purple all of which they called druggie music this went on for weeks afterwards the course mom calls me into his office to let me know that they complained again since the were nonsmokers and i smoked that they wanted me moved i was pissed but before i could get mad the course mom said they are only allowed room mate moves so whoever they get for a room mate they are now stuck with for the next months then he winked at me i was baffled as to what the wink meant after class i went up to my old room to move my stuff to my new room grabbed my stuff and went down to my new room walked in and there were my two old room mates damn was i glad to see they were my new roomies as i finished moving in i went to grab the last of my stuff and the douches new roomies were moving in french canadian guys who smoked packs a day each i laughed for a day thanks course mom near the end of my stay there the base had a conglomeration of guys in my trade in different courses and whenever enough of them get together they always have epic parties my roomy who finished his trades training made me first promise not to tell they guys on my course about the party then he gave me the date and time my course had heard about the party but they didnt know where it was going to be i told them it was at a bar in town kms from the base starting at hrs but it was at the junior ranks bar on the far side of the base starting at hrs best party ever the next monday they all knew they went to the wrong place and i told them it was a great party that they werent wanted at best revenge ever even the guys in their own trade wanted nothing to do with them ps douche took his stereo amp and tv in for repairs but his warranty was voided because the set had been repaired by a nonauthorized repairman to this day so many years later i wonder if they ever figured it out tldr careful who you fuck with and careful how much you whine
years ago when i was just starting out in the world i got a job as a laborer at a medium sized machine rental shop in northern alberta this was my very first real job and i put up with a lot of shit because it was an hour for zero experience and zero training the main source of my discontent came from a man we will call asshat ah was a nepotism hire he married into the company owners family and was given a job to shut his wife up or something ah took verbally abusing me calling me stupid threatening to fire me etc virtually every chance he got i was getting fed up and close to my breaking point when an opportune chance for revenge presented its self in that area of northern ab we had a problem with huge crows picking through garbage for food these birds are massive and ravenous early one morning i was taking out the office trash and i noticed parked close the dumpster was ahs brand new penis compensation ford with a lift and a few thousand worth of chrome bypassing the dumpster i proceeded to ahs truck and with a heave i threw bags full of refuse into his box within minutes a veritable swarm developed around their new found meal the crows gorged themselves on the trash and once satiated decided to use this month old vehicle as a communal toilet fly my pretties fly muahahaha all this happened at am and ah did not leave the shop until close the hours late thats hours worth of crow shit to clean off as much as i was suspected it never came back to bite me and i eventually quit to go back to school tldr i unleashed a murder of crows to defecate on a brand new pick up truck edit it should read let slip the crows of war thanks umigz for the correction
im not sure of this is pro enough for this sub but here goes i live with about people my family of four my aunt her husband and three kids my other aunt and my grandma it was a full house so to say a couple years ago my mom was doing my hair along with my best friends hair for a party we had later on that evening my uncle whos like a father to me storms down the stairs to where i was and starts berating me in our native language hes speaking so fast i can barely understand what hes saying after a few minutes of just sitting there shell shocked ive figured it out the cable bill came in and there were three charges for adult movies he automatically thought it was me me being the eldest in the house my parents are called and im being chastised by all of them im instantly grounded with a promise of a belting later on i did get to go to the party though only because my friend was meant to sleep over after the party this happened on a friday the next week was stressful and a living hell i wasnt allowed to hang with friends and whatnot but i was allowed to stay after school till the late bus pucked us up that was my cool down time my relaxing time that got taken away my parents are ultra conservative and can sometimes be mean spirited my mother wouldnt speak to me my uncle was still angry and ask the kids stayed away from me cause at this point i was collateral damage i dont blame them my family can be scary the only person i had on my side was my aunt the one with the husband and kids she said she believed me when i said it wasnt me tbh i do watch porn however im not dumb enough to order it on demand not once not twice but three dammed times not bragging but im much too smart for that hearing her say she was on my side spurred me into action i called the cable company and asked them if it was possible to see which cable box a movie was ordered from they told me yes that i would need to get the serial numbers of the cable boxes seeing as how they could only confirm or deny if that box was the culprit took me a full weekend to this the bedrooms were hardly ever empty so i had to be quick and undetected after i got all of the numbers i called the company back and lo and behold the videos werent ordered from my cable box but rather the one in the room right across from mine my younger cousin almost a brother had let me take all of the blame for his bullshit hed even come up yo me and told me everything was gonna be okay bull fucking shit okay for him maybe i was fucking livid at that point i wanted to go down there and beat him to a pulp but i didnt the weekend was a day away the whole family would be there if wait till then i was home half an hour earlier than him i was seated when he opened up the front door he smiled and greeted me and the smile i gave him back must have told him that the gig was up he was busted i told him that i knew but i wasnt gonna tell the parents he was he had till sunday night chocking back tears he told me that he was sorry and that he would confess i waited and waited nothing saturday passed by and not a word was spoken i did hear his parents ask him of he was alright he did look a little ill sunday was the same thing i waited and waited but the poor sod refused to say a word i confronted him and told him his time was up he begged me to tell them instead but i wanted to punish him he made his bed and by gods was i going to help tuck him in he still refused to say anything so i called down my mother told her that he has something to tell her you see my mother was the most feared adult in the house she comes down looking confused but willing to listen i tell her that hes got something very important to tell her and i walk away i go into the other room and seconds later i hear a very shocked and angry what part of me feels bad but not that much my mother is angry shes shocked and shes embarrassed you see a dat before i found out who the culprit was we had gotten in an argument her my uncle and i the two of them had been pestering and nagging at me to confess fed up i asked my uncle why not ask your son too youre breathing down my back accusing me of something i didnt do yet you havent asked any of your kids any questions that earned me a few choice of words that would make a whore working the corners blush thats the day i started losing respect for him anyway back to the moment of truth uncle comes strutting into the living room looking at me with a snug smile on his face thinking that i had finally caved and was ready to confess and boy was he wrong ive never seen a black man go so red so fast he was furious all his anger and embarrassment was thrown at my cousin full force im the end my cousin got a spanking and he was grounded his teli was taken from him and to this day almost yeats layer hes not allowed to watch teli oh wait dont go theres more fast forward to august the whole family is taking a trip to canada but my aunt is having some issues she had recently lost my cousins immigration papers so he cant travel any where until they get new ones her two other kids dont even have passports and she only had enough money for one of them she was planning on taking my little cousin jane and leaving the two boys james cousin of this story and jake middle child at home with the grandmas although i really cant afford it i offer to pay jakes passport why so james can stay home all alone with grandma the whole family will be on vacation except that little maggot revenge is like good pizza great while its served hot but still oh so good the next day even when cold yum edit there are a few things id like to clear up some of you think my family is abusive but they are not and no i dont suffer from any kind of stockholm syndrome we may not seem normal to you and why should we we come from a country where it isnt illegal to beat your child as an act of discipline they even sell belts just for that but i can assure you that my family has never hit us without cause and even then at least for my mother her hits are louder than they are painfulits more for show than anything else really this is the norm from where i come from however my parents have changed once seeing how things are done here now if there is a problem its talked yelled out phones are taken away and such i havent been hit in years and nor has my cousin i dont know many abusive parents that can admit when theyre wrong and try changing their ways also as for my cousin the number one reason he doesnt have a teli in his bedroom is because his room is in the basement his room was moved down there not as a punishment but because we renovated and added two new bedrooms down there so he could be somewhat more comfortable where his room the tv can get flooded so he watches tv in the family room or mine he did something shitty faced the consequences and thats it 
i have a really good friend who used to work on a resort island off the east coast of australia it was a fantastic lifestyle and he really had a great time after about years of happily partying and shagging tourists and having an exceptional time of it things started to go downhill in the form of a bully he had two mates and they were picking on my friend and taunting him the ringleader was a huge maori native new zealander guy and there was no way he could stand up to them without getting bashed so they dont realize he is a pro in revenge oh the stories i can tell and he sets his mind to getting his own back on a friday night when the island club is really starting to kick and everyone is there he heads for the kitchen armed with a commercial size botlle of fish sauce he then heads back for the head bullies room he poured it over everything in his bed over all of his clothes in his luggage in his shoes into his shampoo and closed it again everything it kind of dawned on him that hed better start packing now otherwise hes going to get bashed really badly but the only problem is hes on an island there is one ferry a day that goes back to the mainland in the morning he went and packed his bags and had a brilliant idea shave time no more beard nor moustache no more long hair an hour later hes off and hiding in the bush waiting for the ferry to come hours later or so the ferry starts boarding and he walks down the jetty towards it and there stood just at the gangplank is the followers making sure he doesnt leave one of them points to him and says isnt that him to which the other replies no hes got long hair and a beard he walked staright passed them and got on the ferry great success more of the same guy here rprorevengecommentsjefmlightsout
i worked security for two years with a company and before that i had worked a year at another security company so i can say with confidence the general attitude is that were in this together being contractors so security officers stick together maybe not a thin blue tan line like police but we definitely looked after each other one coworker at a site i stayed at for about a year wasnt like that though she straight up told everybody that her job was to man the computer and interact with the people coming and going from the guard shack she didnt even do those two tasks particularly well since there were numerous complaints about her attitude with guests and another coworker who turned into a good friend of mine was always having to correct her work she refused to make small talk as well which might have suited the customers security guy fine but kinda chafed with us other guards our site supervisors had to twist her arm to get her to accept overtime or even go out on patrol and any time there was a lull she was on her phone flagrantly breaking the rules in front of the cameras she had even allegedly but i wouldnt put it past her admitted to my friend that if she ever had the chance to screw someone else to make herself look good she would calling her a cunt would be an insult to female reproductive organs as she lacked the warmth and depth she was in good with the upper management of our company however so she got away with being a really shitty desk clerk one of our myriad duties as security officers at that site was to ensure a plethora of keys were properly controlled and accounted for this mostly meant making sure people signed them out properly and filling out a spreadsheet at the start of each shift well one evening im pulling a hour shift so im there in the middle of second shift which my friend worked the desk for whatever reason he was going through the key box when lo and behold a key was missing looking through the log there wasnt a concrete entry for it but we had suspicion on one entry early in first shift so it likely had been out since that morning well coworker one stays till an hour into second shift so she generally got a few reports done before she left as it turned out she had listed said key as being in the key box when she checked once this was realized both coworker and i had shiteating cheshire cat grins on our faces of course we had to make it look official so since i was going to be taking over the desk when coworker left it would be down to me im not much of an actor but i really nailed the surprised concern with my third shift partner as i discovered the key was missing checked the logs and then checked coworker s sheet of course a missing key required an incident report and i did not hold back i attached a copy of the log sheet and the key report which had coworker s initials and the time she filled out the report i also had to inform first shift about the report in turnover but fortunately coworker came in an hour after first shift started that incident report was the last straw and last i heard about it they were going to replace coworker but i left that post about two months later and was fired just last week for unrelated reasons i think i earned the slight fear of a few of the other guards thanks to that and to head off such comments im not a blue falcon were it anyone else i would have let the client contact do the legwork on investigating and im sure it would have called for a reprimand but since she had a history of screwing up paperwork i think it was just the final nail in the coffin i also am not normally that vicious but by that point i was fucking done with that site for several other reasons so that was me getting some anger out but boy did it feel good
this story isnt for the karma or any of that bullshit this is a throwaway account because i dont need my girlfriend among other people learning about this story as it relates to my involvement in it so i play in a band and hang out with a lot of other guys in bands if you listen to van warped tour kind of music theres a chance you may be familiar with our work here is the thing about bands they share woman very candidly once a girl starts dating a guy in a band shes off limits dont touch her it creates drama not only between the two guys but between the two bands as well record labels and managers especially hate that drama so its in everyones best interest to never ever cheat with a girl dating a guy in another band its an unspoken but wellknown fact another well known fact is that once a girl is single regardless of who she has dated in the past she is fair game guys dont usually raise a huge fuss when their ex bangs another guy from another band its almost expected in hockey you have puckbunnies in bands you have bandbitches it is what it is so i get a call from a girl call her j she was engaged to the singer of a band who you may be familiar with as they have found commercial success j calls me up and says lets get together tonight now i know what this means long and short of it is that we hung out smoked a bit and had some beers and hooked up now she was not wearing an engagement ring and she claimed she and her ex were completely done i was out on tour so i had no idea of their status and she led me to believe that it had been this way for a while once i found out she lied i took charge and wanted to let the guy know i just hooked up with his ex current fiance i felt terrible and knew it needed to be done heres where the drama starts she denies everysinglething she claims it never happened and that i am a total liar now this band bitch has some pull she knows people all over the industry and because she was so pissed that i tried to fuck her over tell the truth she started a campaign against me her fiance and her told everyone i was making shit up and trying to get attention from other bands in reality i was just trying to do what i viewed as the right thing now this went on for months and months and months i would get calls in the middle of the night where one of them would call me or both at the same time for real bitching me out i lost a lot of good friends who sided with them and wanted nothing to do with me fast forward another few months they break up for real like for real she ends up hitting me up again total band bitch and asks to hang out we end up fucking and she thinks the whole past year or so is just the funniest thing after getting her pretty stoned i pull out my phone and i start taking photos of her these will not be shared fellas i got photos of her from behind while fucking from on top from everywhere she was so into being photographed that she started taking photos of herself getting real dirty month or so later we get a call and wouldnt you know it were scheduled by our label to meet up and play six shows together with this band the one who the singer was with j now originally i was thinking about maybe just texting these photos to the guy and being like yo fuck you but it wasnt enough so im pondering what the hell to do in my mind and nothing seems to click until i realized something this band did a song where their backdrop was a bunch of photos and shit i dont want to go into detail other than that however the program that ran the backdrop was controlled by their guitartech on side stage right it was a simple program that ran the photos it was matched to a click track so they changed with the beat of the song on our last night with this band were on the east coast a fellow bandmate of mine and myself figured out what program the tech used what the click rate was on the track and after nights of watching how it was all set up really easy just plug your computer in and the images project on a huge ass screen behind the drummer when it was time for them to play the song that uses the photos we waited until they started after seconds or so of them playing to the normal backdrop my guitar tech called theres away and i plugged my mac in instead of his i waited for the beat to hit and i clicked the spacebar with the beat of the music pictures of j slopping my dick fingering herself and dancing around my house naked were displayed behind the band they went seconds before the band noticed another minutes before it stopped the mother fuckers kept playing and best of all the singer stood there in front of a cheering crowd who loved it forcing him to act like it was part of the show he was pissed you couldnt tell it was me in the photos but it was my mac plugged in and because of my history with his ex he figured it out pretty quickly i got jumped that night by him and two dudes when i was smoking a cig out back punched in the face or times and kicked pretty hard in the ribs once or twice i felt like it was pretty fair i didnt fight back or retaliate just laughed my ass off while getting fucked up worth every bruise and the black eye 
dmitry agarkov received a credit card offer in the mail from tinkoff credit systems after reading the fine print he found that he disagreed with much of their terms so he reprinted an identical copy of the application but his terms stipulated interest no fees and no credit limit he also included clauses penalizing tinkoff for any modifications or breakings of the contract he sent in the application and the company sent him a card thereby approving it and accepting agarkovs modified terms two years later tinkoff sued agarkov for failure to pay fees and interest the judge ruled in agarkovs favor ruling that he only pay the balance remaining on the card usd he has since countersued for approximately k usd citing his various clauses for penalties associated with breaking the contract a ruling has not yet been issued for his countersuit source

in high school jack and stefan hated each other one day stefan took it too far and got jack in a lot of trouble with the school which had repercussions at home with his personal life etc so jack hatched a plan he knew stefan had a sweet tooth he knew stefan liked to gloat and brag he knew stefan didnt like to share jack went to a chemist and bought the largest available bar of laxative chocolate available keep in mind that we were children so it was a lot of money at the time jack then bought a bar of cadbury chocolate very carefully pulled apart the wrapping put in the laxative chocolate and resealed it at school the next day in our weekly extended lunchtime registration where we did all school announcements group activities that bullshit jack gifted stefan with a big bar of cadbury chocolate as a peace offering saying he hoped it would patch things up between them stefan snatched the chocolate and paraded it around the room opened it up told everyone they couldnt have a piece and ate this huge amount of chocolate in under a minute to date its the fastest ive seen someone eat i should mention that the recommended dosage was four squares he easily ate sixty stefan ran out of the room and we didnt see him for three days edit as uloghead pointed out it may not be common knowledge that this is fucking dangerous
i moved into an apartment in the first floor of a complex my nextdoor neighbor owned a large bird looked to be over that made loud noises most of the day and often throughout the night my roommate and i approached the neighbor bird owner or bo a few times over the course of months asking him to please keep his bird quiet bo said he would the first few times but then would just tell us to mind our own fucking business after that we would speak with other tenants in the building as we would see them in the hallways and in the parking lot and they had issues with bo for the incessant bird squawking too i called the management office to file a complaint and they said they would need to investigate which they eventually did unfortunately the bird was quiet when the investigator came out and nobody in bos apartment answered the door so nothing came of it the squawking continued day and night and i recorded some of it and played it to the management office while filing another complaint they said there was no way to prove that the recording i played was from bo and that they needed to witness the noise disturbance first hand traditional channels were not working so i decided to try something different i looked up what type of bird this was and found recordings online of the different sounds they made i located the sound that meant warning predators in the area hide and be silent i put the speakers from my home audio system against the wall that was adjacent to bos apartment and every time that damn bird began to squawk i would play the warning bird call at full volume the bird would shut up for minutes this went on for a while but it was by no means a perfect solution as the bird would still squawk at random times and wake me up at night i ran into some of my other neighbors and we got to talking again about the annoying bird they told me that the bird was getting louder and completely out of hand i realized that they were not only complaining about the birds actual noises but the warning recordings i was playing this gave me an idea i searched for more recordings made by this particular breed of bird and began playing them loudly to see how the bird would react there was one specific sound that incited rage in the bird and it would go nuts for minutes or more i began playing this sound randomly throughout the day at times i knew bo was home the bird would go crazy and squawk loudly every time and bo could do nothing to stop it i heard bo yelling at the bird banging on the birds cage and then other people yelling at each other from that apartment this was amazing i could ruin their day so i started playing the rage sound a few times every night and the bird would go insane i heard people yelling items being thrown and over all of it the bird completely losing its shit after a few days of doing this it sort of lost its sheen so i called the management team and filed another complaint stating that the bird was making the noise right now and that they needed to send someone to investigate the person on the phone said that they were already planning on sending someone due to the large number of complaints they had received over the past few days and that they would be out within minutes i got off the phone and played the rioting bird call the crazy bird reacted just like before and went nuts the investigator showed up soon after the bird still screaming and they had their evidence a week later bo was gone and so was that bird the vacated apartment was left destroyed the apartment management had crews in and out of that place for weeks ripping out carpeting and flooring replacing damaged drywall appliances and fixtures they had kept the bird in the bathroom in and out of a large cage and everything was covered in bird shit what i learned a bird in the bathtub is worth two fists in your goddamn face

not my story but my friends an act of revenge he did back in the s with a scumbag landlord of his he lived at this apartment in dallas for a while and his landlord was a real dick he would complain about nonexistent noises he jacked up the rent via some slimy loophole in the contract he refused to make any repairs and left my friend to call plumbers etc on his own at lot more stuff that i cant remember the final straw was when my friend announced he was moving out he gave about two months notice but the landlord screamed bloody murder about this and that i dont really know but bottom like he flat out announced that my friend would never get his security deposit back my friend was prepared to fight this but then said fuck it a plan of revenge is worth a few hundred bucks by lucky chance for this plan the move out was at the end of augustthe middle of summer there was a closet in the apartment that he cleaned out completely it was fairly large with hardwood floors like the rest of the apartment then he went down to a butchers shop and asked for the offalbasically intestines and scrapthey were going to throw away he came back with a trash bag full of pig stomach intestines fat bones and god knows what else he went back a few more times and got even more bags he put all this offal in these big hefty bags and put them in the closet he then closed the closet door and taped it all to hellit was hermetically sealed no air in or out fast forward two months it was time to go he was moving out he had all his stuff out all that was left to do was leave the keys on the counter and go which he did but the very last thing he did was put on some rubber gloves rubber boots and a facemask and unseal the closet door working as quickly as he could all within a few large breaths he took a knife and cut cut cut all those hefty bags with the two month old offal festering in there he said even holding his breath and breathing through his mouth the stench was unbelievable he dumped the contents on the floor closed the closet door and walked out he never heard back from the landlord again 
not technically an update since grandpa has been gone over years now but my grandma passed away recently and while cleaning out her house i found the newspaper clipping about the phony bomb and wanted to share it clipping here original post here 
this story happened sometime between nd and th grade so forgive a lack of details the revenge was also a bit of happy coincidence so it doesnt involve the plotting characteristic of the best posts on this sub but it was one of my more satisfying revenges nonetheless growing up i lived in a suburb of the twin cities there were a lot of kids in the neighborhood and one of them well call him meany pants was a jerkfaced bully no matter what the game was hed always cheat if he ever didnt get his way hed hit the other kids until they cried and then hed lie and say other kids did it when wed tell our parents hed always always steal peoples toys and then run away looking back he came from that house in the neighborhood lawn all fucked up christmas lights up all year never participated in the luminaria thing at christmas etc im sure the house was shitty because his parents were deadbeats which is probably why he was such a butthead but i digress right across the street from my house there was an ice rink where kids could skate during the winter it was summer at the time and we were all playing around climbing back and forth over the hockey rink fence thing right as this girl was climbing over meany pants grabs her shoe and pushes up so she falls she starts crying so my brother and i yell at meany pants and tell him that he cant play with us anymore because hes a stinky head this doesnt sit well and meany pants picks up a big piece of glass and starts chasing me around with it telling me hes going to stab me i vividly remember this incident and can honestly say it was my first experience with terror i was seriously afraid this crazyass kid was going to stab me meany pants was my age older than my brother so my brother in his infinite wisdom kept his distance and pelted meany pants with rocks until meany pants got sick of not catching me and getting hit with rocks and gave up cut to winter time my brother and i are at the ice rink skating hoping weve forgotten the attempted murder and will be willing to let him play with us meany pants comes up and asks what were doing we tell him to go away because hes mean he says something along the lines of fine i only came here to use the bathroom anyway he goes into the portopotty they had set up for the skaters and locks the door behind him the portopotty is hard up against the berm where they put all the snow that they plow off of the parking lot of the park where the ice rink is so we run over plant our feet on the berm and push on the back of the portopotty as hard as we can it tips over and we hear a scream punctuated by a splash we run away and end up getting totally busted by our mom because we come in the house laughing hysterically and wont tell her why she marched us back across the street to help her roll the portopotty so the door could open when he crawls out meany pants is prettymuch covered in blue stuff and my brother and i cant even laugh because he just looks so miserable and pathetic my moms yelling at us and telling us to apologize which we do my mom walks meany pants home and when she comes back shes even more pissed because his parents read her the riot act we got in sooooooooooooo much trouble if i remember correctly we were completely grounded for a month we didnt think about it as we were running away but it was explained to us loudly by my mother that we are idiots and this was actually a dangerous prank because if my mom hadnt figured out what was going on meany pants would have froze to death oops tldr my brother and i turn a little shit into a shithead edit til that to read someone the riot act is an inflammatory idiom and should be avoided
there was this indian guy who i shared an apartment with in college we were all international students he was so incredibly selfish lazy and annoying and had a ridiculously spoilt upbringing he would borrow silverware from me without asking but instead of washing it up because he didnt know how he later admitted that he just threw it away every time we planned to leave the apt to buy groceries etc he would always delay we would arrange to leave at say pm and he would not be ready until pm one time he flipped out because i just left without him he never helped with cleaningchores in the apartment he preceded to tell about his life back home where his family owned a large business he would have servants at his home doing everything for him then he told how his parents persuaded his high school teacher to tutor him they then bribed her to give him the answers to a test she lost her job over it but all he could do was joke about it and be all smug about how he wasnt really punished by the school he also once hit a homeless man with his car in the street and instead of stopping to help he drove to a police station to tell them the guy died and as the country is so corrupt his family managed to bribepay their way out of jail he would also say how he bribedpaid his way out of speeding tickets getting qualifications and a ton of other shit meanwhile his academic work at college was suffering as he was too lazy to do any work this was the first time he had livedstudied outside of india he had one group assignment where one guy did all his work because they didnt want a bad grade as it was one grade for everyone he then had one assignment where he found a online site and paid someone to do the work for him it was a really easy assignment a pg paper on a business which had all the info he needed on their website worth of his grade i could have done it and im not even doing the same major so after all the bullshit he put me through for the year we lived together and the fact he was such a spoilt asshole i decided to email his professor and tell him he cheated on the paper his professor thanked me for telling him but said it might be difficult to prove still they organised a meeting between him and the school back at the apartment he told us about the meeting and asked me for advice on what to do as i was a senior i told him he should just admit it it was better to be honest now than to lie as it would make it worse and they may not take it as seriously if you admit it early on this was knowing full well the schools policy was immediate expulsion for any form of plagiarismcheating he went to the meeting admitted it and his professor emailed me to update me saying there would still be a drawn out process going to the president for approval getting all necessary people involved etc but that ultimately he would be expelled he still stayed in college working his way through the process until he finally came to the realisation it was all over a year of his life wasted and thousands of dollars in tuition gone down the drain he ended up telling his parents it was group project and another member of his team did the cheating and that it was gonna be a long drawn out investigation where he wasnt sure he could prove his innocence so he said he wanted to just cut his college experience short and come home he didnt really need the degree anyway as he had a job lined up in the family business so he stayed in college to the end of the semester just partying and ended up dropping out before he could be expelled still feel bad his parents didnt know the truth and wasted all that money on his education but at the end of the day i think he needed a lesson that he couldnt pay his way through life not sure it sticked though tldr terrible roommate and spoilt brat cheated on a college paper i told his professor and got him expelled

several years back i began to receive the scam emails from nigeria im sure you are familiar with these so i wont go into a great explanation normally i can just ignore them but these were coming to an email pertaining to a domain that i owned for my computer repair business it started with a few and then grew to about per day every single day it was irritating to get an email notification only to find out that it was one of these bs emails i thoughtwhat to do what to dothen i had an idea i went to angelfire and created a free website with nothing more than a counter on it i shelled out to a command prompt and wrote a batch file that when executed erased bootini nrldr ntdetectcom then launched a browser which loaded the website i had created i put a pause in it silently recursing the windows directory just to make sure their pc made it to the website then it would shut down the pc for those of you not in the know this will prevent a computer from booting stopping at a black screen displaying an error message a good tech could have it back up and going with not much issue but i was betting against that after all this is nigeria i packaged the file into a password protected zip file and emailed it back to a few scammers stating that this was given to me by the bank and contains my banking and credit card information it is set to give a false virus warning to stop scammers the password for the first file is ltpasswordgt please do not steal my information i trust you within days the counter on my website had went from where i tested it to over i have yet to receive another email from scammers at this email address from what i understand they hack each others email in hopes of stealing victims from each other i hope that the downtime i forced upon them was enough to allow for at least a few people to be educated about this scam 
 i dont know i can call this revenge but it sure felt good one day im driving home its about in the afternoon so there are a decent amount of people on the road this particular street im driving on is mostly two lanes but theres a three block section where it widens to three lanes as im approaching this section i notice a large truck in the front spot in my current lanemiddle the third lane is open so i change lanes to the right signaling i pass the line of cars and aforementioned truck signal left and get over with two blocks to spare as im coming up to where these two lanes merge i see a kia sorento flying up behind me in the now nonexistent third lane he passes me and cuts me off without using his blinker puffing on a cigarette i drive a decent little car with ample power so naturally i seize an opportunity to change lanes left pass him get over fly the bird out the window and still make my turn i turn right and he follows me i can tell hes trying desperately to ride my ass and match my speed this particular turn is quite difficult because it has some sharp corners that lead into each other im fully focused on maintaining my mph around these corners nailed it im on the straightaway i simultaneously look in my rearview to check on shithead and hear my gf gasp hes spinning out of control incredibly violently he spins that little kia two and a half rotations before screeching to a halt in a cloud of dust mind you i still havent looked forward because this road is extremely straight i stick my arm out the window and fly him one last triumphant middle finger i then look back at the road just in time to see a cop go by me towards the cloud of dust which housed said kia flip his lights on and pull the guy over happiest road rage experience of my life
i was recently fired as a trainee bus driver after clipping a tree with a side mirror pulling into a bus stop this is something even experienced drivers do which were my bosses exact words two days later i was told i was being let go because of my unsafe approach to bus stops as evidenced by the mirror incident and that the company wasnt a training organisation and didnt have the resources to waste training me even though i was explicitly hired as a trainee so the company i worked for is a subcontractor to the local city councils and school services and provides contract based fillin type work since being fired between looking for new jobs ive been posting complaints to the coordinating body that manages all the little bus companies in the region about the state of the busses uncleanliness unsafe traffic behaviour rude and surly drivers and similar just found out my former company missed out on new school contracts and has not had route service contracts renewed for the new year the operations manager who fired me has not had his contract renewed for failing to maintain the standards of service and the spike in customer complaints spiteful you bet lesson for next time its better to have me inside pissing out rather than outside pissing in

i feel like this is a long story tldr at the end a few years ago my ex and i lived with my mom directly next door to my mom lived a kindly old lady and her greatgrandson about well call him caleb we shared a back yard according to relatives and other neighbors this kid was trouble once caleb took a pack of cigarettes from our vehicle no idea how as we kept it locked and shot them up with a bb gun leaving the mess right in our driveway the list of asshole moves he pulled goes on and on but thats not why im telling this tale he had this bike he rode all day every chance he could up and down the street with some other boys on more than one occasion he left this bike in our driveway behind our vehicles each time we put it in his yard out of harms way well one day the bike goes missing we have no idea how or why but caleb thought we took it i suppose one day my ex was taking the dog outside to use the bathroom and she ran into calebs side of the yard and into the bushes before my ex could get over there she was mysteriously gone we spent hours looking for this dog while we were doing this we see caleb outside with his friends laughing about something and staring at us ex and i go over to ask if theyve seen the dog and they say no but offer to look with us they were looking but not really looking it was all really fishy when we parted ways they sarcastically said good luck finding your dog and laughed days went by we thought she was dead but after a while one of the kids from calebs group of friends brings the dog to calebs greatgrandmothers house dog is back yay we pretty much figured caleb took her because of the searching incident and the fact that every time the dog saw caleb she would howl and run inside the poor thing was traumatized and wasnt the same for months even if he didnt take her he was a shit in many other ways and deserved what he got while all this was going on the bike was in our yard again right behind the car i guess caleb got it back one night ex and i decided wed had enough and caleb needed to pay for hurting our dog armed with the biggest knives we had along with some spray paint we doctored up the bike slashed the tires spray painted it pink and scratched dognapper into the metal we went far into the woods behind an abandoned house on our street and tossed the bike into a giant thorn bush caleb didnt mess with us again tldr asshole teenage neighbor kidnaps and traumatizes our dog we fuck up his beloved bike and leave it in the woods edit wow thanks for the gold i didnt think people would actually read this to clear some things up we didnt do anything directly to him because ex and i were weenies and feared the law caleb was we were we feel bike revenge was the best way to go because he loved that bike he doesnt live next door any more this story took place in late 
so this summer we decided to cram ourselves into a car which we ended up sleeping in after the bars for sake of being to drunk to drive anywhere and drive down to canadas big apple toronto our entire endeavor was to go to a young up and coming edm festival called veld now i want everyone to remember were in canada the land of thank yous and push overs there was about people at this outdoor festival in the middle of downsview park sunnt beautiful scenery beautiful people and fucking awesome music at the begging of dada lifes set these girls decide they are not only going to be rude to to people behind them but they are also going to make the evergrowing garbage problem even worse by taking garbage cans dumping them out on the ground and proceding to stand on them in the middle of a massive crowd now that really was not that big of an issue to me i wasnt really paying attention to them at all but my boyfriend keeps telling me how thier pushing people off who are trying to join them on top of the barrels i go over and ask politely if i can maybe get up on top of the barrels with them there is one free barrel and the girl looks at me and laughs me away saying no there isnt room and there will not be any room kind of taken aback i walk away disappointed i start watching them more closely and there was one or two people that managed to get themselves on top of the barrels too only to be immediately pushed back off an laughed at by these girls my boyfriend has had enough of their snotty attitude in a public place where everybody paid the same amount to be there he collects a few extremely willing people from around us and plots his revenge the helping by standers happened to consist of another angry boyfriend two people who had been pushed and people who were just annoyed to high heavens with these girls they all huddled together waiting for the next drop in the song to come as it builds up and drops all of them kick the tops of the barrels making all the girls plummet to a horrible embarrassment that they brought upon themselves they stand up and turn around for help or for someone to rat us out everybody kind of just laughed and cleared away without asking if they were ok or anything sweet sweet revenge we do have a video of it here if anyones interested 
original post added some additional details that i had replied to in the comments in original post reddit i am not proud of what i did and i do feel that karma will get me one day i am prepared for it i am embarrassed that a somewhat successful individual such as myself is capable of something so childish and embarrassing im ill try to make this short background me and my ex had been together for about year long distance relationship he lived about hours away i find out from his sister that he was talking to other women when we were still together and confrontations with him lead nowhere with him saying that i am the only one on his mind and that he would never do that to me the usual spiel and that his sister does not know what she is talking about i take his side because i loved him weeks ago i find out from a mutual friend that he has been seeing and sleeping with this girl in his town i confront him about it and he flips everything around on me saying that its so hard for him to keep his dick in his pants while i am living so far away that i neglect him which i dont i am the one that drives to see him every other weekend when i have the funds we call text skype each other daily that i dont want him to live with me which is true because i dont want to take care of a grown ass man and pay his bills he says he loves me and wants to make it work and drops all contact the next day i was heartbroken i talked to my friends and they said the girl he is hooking up with is an easy slut that has been around and that they are in a relationship the day after me and the ex had the talk probably even before then weeks ago while still hurting heartbroken i reactivated my facebook and meticulously combed through my ex and his new loves profiles i know i should not have done this but whatever i did not dwell on their flirty messages but instead focused on her profile i read through months of disgusting selfies of her in a dirty dark bathroom with barely there clothes that even a floozy would be embarrassed of being caught in then i did it i made a fake facebook profile of a fineass looking man from google that used to go to her school i befriended all of her friends made fake posts and befriended her all of this took less than a day you would be surprised at how many people would befriend you on facebook just from your looks regardless of if they know you or not i had about friends in just hours and at that point people were requesting to be my friend every few minutes i dunno who is more pathetic me or these weirdos just me probably i started to chat her up the next day she was very open with herself even sending me new pictures of herself in little clothing to a complete stranger without any in return being a woman myself it was easy to tell her what she wanted to hear days later she was complaining about my ex to me already i told her i wanted to meet up and will pick her up and show her what its like to be with a real man at this point i had hours of conversations saved her saying the dirtiest shit that ive ever read pictures videos what have you it was time while all this was going on my ex started to contact me saying it was a mistake i asked him if they had broken up he says yes twice and they were not obviously this should have broken my heart but it didnt i knew the truth but told him that yes i love him and that i want him to move in with me he sounded happy excited whatever and said that he was going to give his weeks to his boss that day he texted me later and told me that he just left them with no notice instead because fuck em he was going to start packing and will head out with everything later in the week the revenge i posted all of the conversations up on fake facebook tagged her in it posted the pictures and videos for my exs eyes only and sat back and enjoyed the show before i deactivated the fake acc i had likes and messages her family friends all saw it my ex saw it and almost immediately texted me to say how he misses me he cant wait to be with me and doesnt mention anything about the girl friday rolls around and he tells me he is on his way to my apt he does not know where i live because i recently moved i tell him to meet me at a cvs close by so i direct him on where to go he tells me he is almost out of gas and that i will have to help him put some in it i agree and tell him that i will once he gets there i get a text telling me hes at the cvs and asks where i am i ignore it minutes later he blows up my phone calls ignored i made it a point to let it ring once so that he knows i send it to voicemail hour later he calls and leaves me a voicemail that he is worried and if i am ok i am fanfuckingtastic hours later he says that he is stranded drove to another cvs thinking i was there but now he has no gas and is stranded at a gas station with his things in the car calls ignored i take an ambien and go to bed saturday morning i have text messages missed calls and voicemails from him and that he had to call his mom to come pick him up since then i blocked his number and then had to change my number since he would then start calling me from his familys phone and blocked calls i get a msg on fb from his sister she tells me he came home crying like a fucking baby and since his mom knows pretty much what happened between me and him she was not very sympathetic but pretty upset with me his sister thought i was a badass and deserved better than his lying cheating loser of a brother i know i acted on impulse on all of this probably destroyed this girls life i will probably reactivate fake profile to say sorry or whatever but maybe not she did knowingly sleep with a man that had a girlfriend seduced him even i know this sounds crazy but the feelings i had for my ex are still there he will never forgive me since he is now unemployed and the whole town knows his business the girl admitted his dick is tiny part of me regrets everything and that i want him back with me other part of me is glad i destroyed any type of reconciliation as it was not going to work out in the end feels good to let this out tldr bf cheated created fake facebook to lure new gf worked seemingly reconciled with ex but then left him stranded hours away from home additional bits of info i copied from comment replies he was a friend for years before asking me to be his gf i left a lot of details out such as helping him financially with the car he has as well as food for him and his family because they wouldnt have had anything to eat otherwise i stuck by this guy through his worst times the lowest point he was ever in and he screws around on me with the slut of the town and lies about it many times contacts me and gives me false hope and then disappears suddenly without an explanation so he can stick his dick in a dirty whore im rambling she doesnt know it was me just a random dude that put her shit on blast i made a point not to share the pictures only to my ex and even those were sent from fake facebook with face blurred out the tasteless tats were there though so he knows its her nobody has connected the dots yet i tried to be careful about this i lost him yes but i dont want him back i have also booked a gyno appointment thanks to him

so this story takes place around early i was walking around the city with my friends some of which are hooligans as we teens are wont to be and we walked past a planned parenthood clinic with all the fundies in front of it with their dead foetus signs and jeering so one of my friends flipped them off that would have been the end of the story but unfortunately for me i had to bike past the church they came from to get to school every morning and one of them recognized me i cycled away as they jeered and yelled the usual burn in hell sinner and went to school i got tired of this of course it was a rather unlovely way to start my day i started going to the church learning how to get back at them for making my mornings annoying i told them that i repented i told them my friend wasnt a friend but just a guy that one of my friends knew and of course i wasnt friends with a sinner like that i learned that the pastor used lots of youtube videos and lots of online presentations to preach that the church had been remodeled a lot and had lots of power outlets in corners of cabinets and such and finally that it had an open wifi network i had a friend that had an old phone that he wanted rooted i rooted it for him in exchange for being able to borrow it for a month i rooted the phone and installed three apps a remote access tool that let me control the phone from my computer a wifi organization tool i walked around the neighborhood where the church was and let it sniff all the open networks and told it to connect to either the churchs wifi or any new open wifi in case the played with the router and the crown jewel a dns spoofer i set up to redirect at random all web pages to either rick astley lol limewire michael jackson grunts or old greg and pause for seconds every five minutes so i could control it if i wanted to i took this phone to the church with a charger found a cupboard with an outlet in it that looked like it wasnt used often and set it up at the sermon the pastor gave his usual ra ra speech before trying to open a prezi and it redirecting to michael jackson grunting a lot he refreshed the page old greg again rickrolled again yar har i had to go to the bathroom and laugh because they were so confused i left it there for a month occasionally adding new pages just to freshen it up they were incredibly confused and upset i took it back and returned it to my friend and never went to that church again and changed my biking route so they wouldnt yell at me tldr angry fundies got mad at me and yelled at me on my way to school so i trolled them big time
ok so this story belongs to urubyrhod and can be read in this however ill copy it in here because of the rules here it goes gt when a kid is being a brat in a noisy and public area i casually get close to them and fart on their headface im really tall so its usually a direct hit gt gt its funniest when the kid notices and doesnt know what to do because im a fucking giant and ill eat them if they tell their mommy gt gt if i decide to stare its usually with a yeah what the fuck are you gonna do about it look gt gt im about so even when im just trying to be friendly ie not farting on a stanger kids head and meeting a family members or friends kid for the first time ive noticed they get very hide between their mothers legs intimidated on sight if im not sitting down so its not hard for me to silenceintimidate a child especially when im trying to gt gt however a few times ive been called out one time i was pretty drunk with a friend at a target buying risk and no we never finished playing the whole game this little mexican year old with a mohawk was being an insufferable little shit in the action figure section i heard him from like aisles over and it was like nails on a chalkboard i tell my friend im gonna fart on this kids head watch and learn gt gt i saunter on over to the aisle in question and see the vile little prick calling his mom an idiot for not buying him a huge fucking gi joe the movie vehicle which pissed me off even more considering how awful that movie was buy some good toys i already bought that one for you and you broke it by throwing it down the stairs shut up i need it its the only one i dont have now the mother was younger than me im mid twenties and gave a defeated look i dont have enough money right now you are an idiot and continued to just berate and publicly shame this woman gt gt at the time i was on a strict chipotle carnitas burrito diet and while i was watching all this my stomach gave me an initial warning gurgle very courteous stomach telling me i was about an hour away from punishing the toilet serendipity destiny gt gt i inch a bit closer to my prey inspecting some wrestling toys and pondering the weird homoeroticness of the whole sport in general the kid shouts fuck you i hate you the mom rolls her eyes and turns her back to the kid to ignore him and could you believe it the kid gets on his hands and knees and starts taking the toy out of the box its go time motherfucker gt gt i position my back towards him and at this point am like feet away from him his head is down getting frustrated with those god damn twisty tie things and i go for the kill i bend down to reach for the one of the toys on the lower shelf at this point my ass is inches away from this kids head gt gt now generally speaking the best way to go about this is to act casual drop your belly bomb then walk away after a few seconds like nothing is out of the ordinary i usually go one aisle over and listen to the kids reaction in delight however today i couldnt help myself i have my head tilted back looking at this kid out of the corner of my eye to ensure accuracy gt gt im so close that from a distance it looks like im about to sit on him my friend sees this happening and can no longer contain himself hes covering his mouth but his heehaw hyperventilating donkey chortle is fairly audible over the late s pop muzak playing on the loudspeakers gt gt the kid immediately looks up towards the laughter but cant help but notice there is an ass now directly in his face now im trying not to laugh but also panicking as i just made eye contact with him he furls his brow and i look over in the mothers direction still back towards us i relish in the moment and the look on this childs confused and naive face gt gt the initial blast was mighty and boisterous i swear i saw his hair blowing in the wind so to speak if i wasnt wearing jeans i think it could have probably blown over an empty soda can i would call it a very fun fart a would buy again however what immediately followed that out the chamber was truly horrifying the farts implication changed without notice and swiftly it went from a joyous dry airhorn squeal to a nefarious hissing mephitis i think the little moppet noticed the hateful metamorphosis before even i did because he wretched his neck violently trying to get away from the personified evil being fumigated into his soul because of his positioning hovering over the toy hands and knee it was all in vain as the only way out was forwardand forward would mean certain death i had positioned myself well on the higher ground free to escape or relent at any time and him poor and immobilized biding his time until the cruel attack was over obviously this child needed to reread sun tzu gt in total it lasted about seconds but for that kid it must have seemed like time was frozen the longterm severe brain damage which he no doubt suffered only added to that effect gt when i finished with my bidness ie forcing a little boy to huff my farts there was a silent pregnant pause the kid was clearly shocked and stunned no one had ever stood up to this dwarf sociopath in his whole life i had taken the words out of his mouth and filled it with fart gt gt i make my move first picking up the toy i was reaching for off the low shelf take a few steps forward and stare at it for a few seconds on alligator the only thing the kid could manage to do was burst into tears my friend senses danger the jig is up and his head darts for cover the mom turns around to see her kid with an open toy crying on the floor and me minding my own business gt she walks up to him and asks whats wrong but the kid cant speak all he gets out is bawawaaawafartbawawa it took every fiber in my body not to laugh i put the toy back on a middle shelf turn around give a final nonchalant looksy and then begin to take my exit gt sensing that his assailant was getting away scotfree he somehow managed to compose himself for a moment he shouts he farted on me i could feel him pointing at me but i continued to act like i was just browsing i was almost around the corner when the mom goes gt gt excuse mesirsir gt i turn around nonplussed uhwho me while pointing to myself gt yes did you just fart on my son gt weighing my options i played dumb what i mean i did fart gt on my son gt well i mean technically speakingi meanwhat is on gt why did you fart on my son gt at this point the little kid has the look of schadenfreude on his face happy to see me in trouble fuck you im a man i will fart on you if i please i turn my attention to the little kid and stare at him gt because the whole store could hear him being a little rotten asshole to his mother so i thought id come over here and treat him like one gt gt the mom looks at me her son and the scattered gi joewrappersbox on the floor the mom is puzzled as to what to do and says justjust go thats my cue i turn around walk away with

friends house played risk until in the morning while drinking scotch overall i would say it was a preeeetay preeeeetay good day
disclaimer this is not my revenge story but one i thought you guys would like the story so there is this guy who is a professional landscaper and he was contracted to do a big job for someone the whole deal completely reshaping the garden and basically making it look amazing so i hear but he had one problem he didnt get paid the revenge now this guy doesnt like not getting paid i have another story about him so what he does is magic after weeks of trying to get paid he had enough he put on a boiler suit and a mask he jumped into his van and drove to he house went to the garden and sprayed a kill everything weed killer over every thing the best part is it took days for them to notice and there was nothing they could do about it
so when i was a teenager we had the dick neighbor you know the one that to call the cops has to just hit redial so after years of him yelling at us for playing ball to near his house or how we needed to cut our grass shorter because it wasnt even with his and looked bad or the party after party he had the cops show up at our house and not even teen drinking parties either just normal ones my folks were having with the music set to like finally i just could not take it anymore after the last thing so its a saturday afternoon in july pm my friends and i are out playing with our cars as teen age boys do ie rebuilding a engine etc suddenly the cops show up we are all wtf after talking with us asking about what we are doing he finally says ok and heads to our neighbors house tells the guy that at oclock on a saturday afternoon is when we are suppose to be making noise and not to call again i decided ok fuck this already so about am i sneak over his place and remove all his lug nuts at am i am woken up to a loud thunk and cursing i look out my window see his car in the street all four tires are off the hubs and pushed up into his fenders he still was the dick neighbor but i had a smile on my face when i saw him and thought of the time and money i cost him
note im not sure if this really belongs here so please let me know if i should move it i apologize for the shitty grammar and formatting its not my strongest point and i suck at explaining things i posted a dumbed down version of this as a comment in askreddit but ill add more detail here this started about years ago when i was my friends and i were just a normal group of kids who enjoyed everything from playing with sticks to building monsters out of bionicle we were harmless and stayed out of trouble anyway this asshole whom i shall refer to as anal decided it was in his interests to bully us keep in mind that im talking about a fully grown year old man at the time one day we were doing our usual stuff and kicking a ball around in a mostly empty car park only anals car was there and we were nowhere near it now this creep must have been watching us from his house which was about metres away because as soon as the ball rolled near his car he came sprinting out like a nutjob and snatched the ball we asked for it back and naturally he said no so we had to get my friends dad to get it anal lied and told him that we were jumping on his car and kicking the ball against it so we got into trouble this had started to happen quite often to the point of our parents doubting him but not doing anything about it because it wasnt really worth the drama and time we eventually started to hang about with his son fedora fedora was pretty cool at first but he started acting like an idiot i dont mean normal kids stuff he would scream in your ear or spit on you thinking it was hilarious he also had a really high pitched laugh like a damn monkey we decided to distance ourselves from him and not bother with him but he kept coming back now to make things worse his dad always seemed to be watching somehow because every time fedora got injured he would be straight out to blame and accuse us of bullying example fedora sprinted into a lamp post and knocked himself out anal went apeshit and threatened our parents that if we continued he would call the police example fedora fell off his scooter in front of his dad and anal told our parents we did it example he got stuck up a lamp post and once again we got the blame when we were anal really went too far this time we kicked our ball over his fence by accident and he was in the garden ready he popped his head over looking all smug but luckily my friends mother could see through the kitchen window anal came outside ready to complain but my friends mother was ready for it and couldnt be bothered to deal with his shit she asked him if he could pass it back and what did he say fuck off you cunt now my friends dad had heard this and his eyes caught fire keep in mind that he is really well built while anal is a skinny little shit who can only talk big anal only ended up with a black eye because he managed to scramble away and call the police luckily nothing was really done about it because it was our words over his time went on and he kept trying shit but now we were hormonal teens so this was a mistake on his part because we had nothing to lose gave no shits and knew how much he loved his car one night we shoved dog shit up his exhaust pipe and sealed it off with a used condom used his aerial to poke more shit covered his handles in shit rubbed ketcup on his windows and let his tires down that was when it all started when it snowed we tried wrapping his car in cling film and poured warm water over it to get it to freeze over but it didnt work out too well so we just covered it in snow and it stuck really well this helped the water freeze over and give him a hell of a job getting it off sometimes we would just steal his aerial or simply let down two tires other times we would just piss against it other things we did to him would be petty stuff like hiding his bin on bin day so the binmen didnt empty it pelting his house with a dozen eggs on halloween post shit through his letter box etc i had a feeling he knew it was us because he bothered us a lot less im now its been at least years since we last messed with him because we are all getting on with our lives and definitely doing better than him he tries acting friendly with me but keeps his distance the lesson of this story is that those kids you fuck with will one day grow up and it will be too late to realize that youve molded a fucking monster
okay so i am a bouncer proof username i know this is long but there is a tldr at the bottom there are nights however when i go to the bar and drink on my nights off this was one of those nights so its a wednesday night at the bar and im off wednesdays are greek night and pitchers of whiskey and coke and they make the drinks very strong so the bar is full of drunk frat guys and shitfaced sorority

a few hours drinking and chatting with my co workers and its around am the bar has a good amount a people in it well ive been talking to this girl at the bar and she wants to go dance i like to think my big ass can get down so i oblige were dancing for a while when i see this cocksucking fuck ass dick mcsonofabitch walk in to the dancefloor area hes a part of the douchebag fraternity on campus the guys that jump people in the parking lot for looking at a girl wrong the guys that cant get in trouble on campus because theyve been there for so long the self entitled assholes that do what they want because they think theyre invincible so this guy his name can be p for pussy comes in the bar drunker than a three legged deer riding an escalator hes grabbing at the shot girls and causing a ruckus all around hey its my night off i aint dealing with this shit but i keep an eye on him just in case i need to intervene once youre a bouncer you stay a bouncer hes bumping guys and yelling fuck yous to everyone that looks at him weird hes looking for a fight tonight well p seems to settle down a little bit and he gets on the dancefloor about feet away from me hes dancing i say dancing he looked like a th grader and he keeps rubbing his hands all over her ass and legs he gets a little ambitious and starts going for her waistband to finger her i imagine she keeps slapping his hand away after a few times he gets visibly frustrated he decides that hes getting what he wants and goes straight to stick his hand up her skirt she pushes him away with an oh my gosh get away from me expression he tries to grab her again and she pushes him and yells no he grabs her even hard so she spits in his face this all happened in a few seconds well what happened next made me the angriest i have ever been in my life he slapped her across the face hard so hard she fell to the ground now i can stand a lot but you dont ever put your fucking hands on a woman i see red i yell mother fucker and go over to him as fast as i can the dance floor was pretty packed and i shove him against some railing that enclosed the dance floor he swings and jaws me from what the other bouncers tell me it was a hard hit i barely felt a thing due to the alcohol and anger i swing back around and come down on his nose with my fist it was an awkward punch but powerful he staggered back against the railing i dont know why i did this i guess i watched too much wrestling as a kid i ran at him and clotheslined him and myself over the railing i roll over on top of him and just start hitting him as hard as i could everywhere the face the chest the neck i wanted to cause as much pain as possible to this mother fucker who would dare hit a girl i was eventually pulled off by the other bouncers but right before i was i headbutted the fuck out of him p just laid there not unconscious but not moving and definitely in a lot of pain his nose was crooked probably broken and blood poured down all of his face his face was red his lip busted and his shirt was torn i had teeth marks in my forehead and my jaw hurt the whole incident happened in a short amount of time but it felt like forever the bouncers picked him up and threw him out of the bar they said if he ever comes back theyll beat his face in my boss gave me a ride home and said he would have to write me up for having a fight i didnt care i was still so angry the girl he hit is okay i was just so dang mad that anyone would dare lay a hand on a girl and i wanted to do what i can so he could never hit a girl again i have a friend in that fraternity who didnt care for p too much he told me that p had two black eyes for a few days his nose is broken his tooth is crooked and get this he broke his thumb punching me in the jaw from what i hear he wanted to press charges but once his parents found out that he hit a girl they wouldnt let him since they pay for every single thing he does they have the power i hope that mother fucker remembers me for the rest of his life and takes that night as a lesson i know that there are gonna be some of you that read this and want to bitch me out and say that was stupid and that im a horrible bouncer for having a fight at work theres always a few of you well fuck yall i dont know what yalls morals are but i dont stand hitting women yall can get on another thread and bitch to someone who gives a shit tldr drunk asshole is drunk tries to sexually assault a girl she spits in his face he hits her i see red and go after him punch kick headbutt and hurt this guy he gets a broken nose thumb two black eyes and busted lips he wants to press charges but his parents wont let him because they found out he hit a girl also titties edit i admit this is more justiceporn than anything else if you knew the guy on a personal level like i do though you would understand how its revenge for me he causes a lot of problems in the bar hes lead jumpings of my friends in the parking lot and hes just a general douchebag to most he needed to be taught a lesson now whether or not yall decide that this is revenge or not i posted this for people to enjoy and relish that an asshole got beat
alright so i just recently discovered this subreddit and i love you all the revenge stories are perfect so i figured id share one of mine from a while ago flashback to middle school im maybe or so short little chubby and the new kid in a public school former christianprivate school student so im horribly socially awkward as my former classmates i had known for years now i was at a school where i knew no one naturally this made me a target for bullying so introducing the primary bully wangster as he was a suburbanwhite boy who thought wearing snapbacks dcs and listening to lil wayne made you a gangster well everyday we had a reading block nerdy me lost his mind when i discovered the school had a library with actual books i read the entire harry potter series in two weeks well id get to reading block a bit earlier and usually the teacher would let me sit in the class to get that extra time with the wonderful wizarding world wangster and his friends would show up sit directly behind me taunting me they were smart and were only loud enough for me to hear and not the teacher when she would leave wangster would pull the same stunt hey thats my chair followed by the seat i was using being pulled directly out from under me id hit my head on the desk and even got a bruise once after the fourth time i did what any sensible kid would do and reported it to the teacher now the teacher knew that i had a rough time adjusting to school so she confronted wangster and his friends of course they all back each other up and nothing came about well thats a lie after wangster found out i reported him the bullying got worse id be shoved into lockers in the hallway get food knocked out of my hand at lunch and my books mysteriously started disappearing i kept multiple to bring home and read seriously i fucking love reading so one day i decided to get my revenge during this entire time he still kept chair gag and thought it was the funniest shit so one day i sat reading yet another book when the walked in i stopped reading but faked looking like i wasnt paying attention the teacher left the room for a moment probably to get water or something thats when wangster made his move watch this he whispered i carefully lifted my weight up off the chair hey thats my fwooosh i stood up as fast as i could snapping my knees sending the chair flying behind me now while i was a chubbier kid i had also been playing tennis both recreational and competitively for about five years the chair flew back nailing him square in the groin he keeled over tears almost welling in his face the teacher walked in to see wangster almost crying and me feigning a shocked look on my face what happened im so sorry wangster i didnt know you were behind me i apologized i turned around to help him up to which he smacked my arm away fuck you clifford he whispered under his breath here you take this chair ill grab another i said with a grin just quiet enough for him to hear me that concludes my story for now ive got a couple others involving wangster and his comrades 
op has since been removed but this was obtained from the cached version i had to come on here and get some kind of sideline perspective because currently no one else in the family knows that the reason sil is deported is because of my wife not sure i should out her either in my current state of mind sorry if this is longdisorganized my mind is currently in chaos background we have been together for years no kids basically all of this began when my brother and sil moved back to our home country after he had been living in sils country prior to that my wife emma didnt have an issue with sil my wife and sil are both from the states but my wife has been living with me in my home country since we got married my brother and sil are what some people might call freespirited sil is from portland something wife rolls her eyes at and is very hipster they both smoke regularly something i dont have an issue with but dont feel like getting involved with either my wife has no issues with drugsdrug use but she cant stand how much my brother and sil talk about pot whenever we see them six months ago my wife decided to finish her masters degree and was offered an opportunity to do a semester abroad coinciding with that time my brother and sil moved back here permanently however from what i understand sil is technically still on a tourist visa which has expired by now since they came in february and im not really sure what was going on with the whole paperwork process they seem to be bad at planning sil has mentioned before that she wants to have a kid with my brother because she would not only get paid maternity leave here but it would cement her staying she told my wife this over facebook messages as well when my wife left to do her semester abroad and brother and sil moved in we hung out a lot more at first my wife was cool with it and would say hi etc but things changed when bro and sil invited me on a road trip to sweden something that my wife has always wanted to do with me but we never got around to after that she would become short in her answers whenever i said i was hanging out with them she began to make subtle comments about sil and the more i saw them the more vicious the comments got as a result i didnt go out with my bro so much when i knew sil would be there i love my brother but honestly he takes a lot of energy to be around so its not something i really minded too much however things came to a head when both sil and my wife entered the same photo competition my wife entered first and then sil saw her post and entered two days after then she and sil engaged in pretty childish subtle facebook statuses about each other always masked as someone or this person my wife was pissed and i took the opportunity to ask her what was going on between her and sil she basically told me that she resented how sil got to see me all the time now and how she feels inadequate compared to her because sil does all the cooking although its mostly those minimalist dishes people make for instagram and not very appetizing for me and i am the one who cooks in our marriage sil is also asian and i made the mistake of telling my wife that i had had a thing for asian girls back when i was and everything japanese was all trendy she was also upset that i had gone to bro and sils wedding without her while she had been abroad during her bachelors degree she also is afraid that im going to start smoking again because of them i told her it was not something i was interested in because pot mostly makes me paranoid and depressed she also brought up that she hates how i will talk shit about my brother and sil mostly about their need to constantly talking about smoking and some of their very outthere ideas about things but act perfectly fine to their faces she said she feels like im placating her by saying sil is annoying but i still go see her she said it makes her feel like i will lie to fit the situation and that bothers her well i hadnt seen bro or sil for a few weeks now and my wife and i were back to normal she came home and we were having a good time seeing all our other friends she didnt even bat an eyelash when i said some of the guys had invited me out for a guys night all was good then last week my brother called and asked me if i wanted to hang out he sounded pretty high and i told him no emma casually asked what was up and i told her she got a bit quiet then shrugged and went back to doing whatever about minutes afterwards she said she was going to take the dog for a walk and run to the shop to get some vegetables for dinner this is basically what went down she went outside called the police anonymously and said that she was a concerned neighbor and could smell marijuana coming from my brothers flat the police came my brother and sil were arrested and fined however when they went to pull up sils profile to record the incident they discovered her expired tourist visa she had to be transferred to a sort of holding facility for people who are in queue for being deported now there is a whole shitstorm happening my brother is beyond upset and the family is shocked this isnt really something that can be worked around as marijuana is illegal in this country and she was on an expired visa and they didnt file the correct paperwork for her to live here legally so if she is deported she may face a year ban this means either the end of their marriage or my brother will need to figure out how ot move to the us with her the thing is no one knows it was my wife except me and she doesnt even sound the least bit remorseful we had a huge row about it and she stood by her decision saying that if sil was that stupid to do illegal drugs as well as not have her papers in order then it was on her if im being honest i dont care so much about sil being deported but i care that my wife felt so threatened by her that she went to this length shes the type to made subtle remarks and be frosty but she has never done anything close to this before so now im in a real bind i really dont know what to do i definitely cannot tell the family and i dont really feel the obligation to anyway im not close with my mom because she left me as a kid and i dont talk to any of my relatives really except my dad and brother but i cannot just let this slide i need to impress upon her that she has potentially ruined a marriage all in effort to remove someone she finds annoying from our lives someone we dont even have to see every day what advice can you guys give me theres no one else i can even talk to about this update holy hell this really blew up i will post a real update soon but your comments and messages are very appreciated things are quite tense atm but tomorrow we have agreed upon a sitdown will update letting you all know what happens now with us and the situation as of this moment sil is definitely being deported tldr wife and sil have rivalry wife called the cops on sil while knowing that sil has an expired visa sil is on her way to being deported edit this is not my story the story was posted in rrelationships by another user
my aunts story what had happened was equally as simple as it was annoying her group of friends would be walking by a cluster of upperclassmen and as a scare tactic they would lean into their faces and bark at them like dogs they captured the reaction they dreamed of so this sort of bullying happened for many weeks not long after this same barking bullshit was being used across the school girls who got this treatment really lost their shit which just egged the seniors on further my aunt and her closest friend were the only ones left that stood through the pestering to handle the situation therefore the targets on their backs had grown substantially the final day the girls were approached had been building towards the seniors they strode each one prepped and determined to get a reaction out of the duothey chorus of girls leaned in all at once and were just about to bark when shhhh my aunt had defiantly shushed their stunned faces faces watching her hand reach into her pocket she tossed a handful of dog bones for the bitches and kept on walking and that was the end of that 
this is a crosspost from tales from tech support i was told to post this here as it definitely qualifies as pro revenge you send me one spam i help get your mlm company shut down and nail you for k out of your personal pocket ive run it by the mods before i posted it just to make sure it was kosher ive redacted the links to the press releases as well as the actual entitys name well be referring to it as the funky spammer tuxedo jack and craptacularly spignificant productions present those who hunt spammers part the second im up all night to get funky nearly a year had passed and it was the middle of october id left the managed services provider i worked at the one what catered to the vapid bleachedblonde pennypinching harpy and i was working at the hospital chain in austin id gotten engaged and id moved to an apartment one block from my office the spammers whod bothered me in had buggered off never to be seen or heard from again and the torrents of crap that had taken up so much space in my pst file trickled down to a few scams every now and again of course there was still the occasional spam that got through and those were usually deleted life was pretty good sure enough though that was a finite thing more holes in openrealtys tellafriend function had been found and people were using it once again to spam payday loan affiliates spammed my inbox my retribution was swift and severe a bit of googlefu found the name and home phone number of the ceo of the company whose products they were spamming and a quick call to his house again in arizona what is it with that state and spammers during dinner got me the name and contact information for the affiliate who was spamming me it didnt hurt that i namedropped when i called the president he knew about the guy id nailed prior to this needless to say that ended spams from them quickly one night my phone dinged at pm to signal an incoming email a quick look at it showed that it was a typical spam it named a company whose name started with funky which was a penny auction site similar to the zeekrewards scam that was shut down around august an affiliate link was inside it run through a url shortener but it wasnt anything that firebug and the network request panel in firefox ctrl shift k just fyi couldnt track properly i fired up camtasia to record my thought process while i went through analysis for the spam and yes this is the incident that spawned my infamous drunken profanityinfused spam analysis video to which ive made references to other times no you dont get to see it it drops my real name in there well lets see the headers are spoofed theres the use of a compromised openrealty server in the netherlands theres no visible physical address for removal theres no huh thats odd at the bottom of the message it said the following i am sharing this opportunity just once but if you have doubts you can unsubscribe anytime by simply send a blank email to and put remove as your subject the only question was where the hell were you supposed to send the email to there was no physical address and the email address was no doubt falsified a wonderful wicked idea struck me and i opened up my laptop while it booted i kept going through my analysis and i got the affiliate id from the link a perusal of their site showed no functional privacy policy no terms of service nothing but a site that seemed designed to collect email addresses and skype names for a future launch however they did have a page with their lawyers bio on it in which he had a link to his facebook page so i paid a quick visit to said page and perused it for a bit after a series of messages with him amazingly enough he was online at the time in which i asked to be removed he stated that he wasnt a point of contact for his client and said that i should go to them directly for optout requests he didnt however give me the owners name or any contact information i shrugged it off no matter id have it easy enough after a bit of work besides who likes dealing with lawyers at that point my laptop chimed to signal that it was done booting and i launched firefox on it i navigated over to mailyahoocom and for kicks and giggles i attempted to create a new mail account with the same address the spammer had used as a replyto lets see redacted at yahoo dot com i snorted no way hes stupid enough to use an account that doesnt exist if he doesnt want canspam violations a few seconds later i completed my mastery in the emulation of picard read facepalm as yahoo allowed me to create the email address successfully i keyed in a variant on one of my usual passwords and a few seconds later i was at the inbox which started to ding as replies with the word remove as the subject flowed in steadily yes thats right i managed to create a mail account one that was purportedly already being used for optout requests for a mlm penny auction schemes spammers and thus managed to prove conclusively that the affiliate never had any intention of honoring optouts but wait it gets better canspam does have some teeth the mccain amendment holds the key the companies being spammed can be held liable for damages ftc penalties and remedies if they know or should have known that their business was being promoted by spam i was sure that this would pass a prima facie test for this and after consulting with a lawyer friend of mine i was reassured and then some over the next day or two i gathered information about the company i dug up the llc records which showed it to be an llc based out of montana a few calls to various agencies later id reached someone whod given a damn and i was told to forward on all the information id gathered about the company to the montana commissioner of securities and insurance which handled such things like insurance investments and as it happened penny auction scams for which it had issued a warning about for zeekrewards a few months prior meanwhile a metric assload of replies flowed into the yahoo account most of which had bodies filled with expletives and profanity everything i gathered including credentials to the yahoo account was passed on to them as well as the ftc and sec i noticed they didnt change the password to the account but i didnt care really the bodies of the replies that came in were hilarious i didnt hear anything from the mcsi for a few weeks though id noticed the web had gone quiet about the site and the mlm forums i lurked on for intel strangely seemed to have a lot of threads complaining about that company purged for no apparent reason one brisk fall morning translation degrees and dry it is texas after all in midnovember i walked into my cube and docked my latitude e then went and got ounces of cafe verona from the break room before sitting down and loading firefox i loaded up the mcsis site to see if there was an update on the funky spammer i did not expect to see that the commissioner of securities and insurance had a press release up stating theyd ordered them to stop doing business i mean im sure as hell not complaining its rare as hell that you get to see your efforts vindicated in such a fashion in all fairness though id be lying if i said i didnt do a happy dance and squee rather loudly in my cube i was quite happy that a certain coworker whom ive mentioned before wasnt working there that day because the look i would get from her would be both flabbergasted and gobsmacked tinged with more than just a hint of why the hell are you doing that at work though the looks i got from the head of network security and my other nearby coworkers almost almost offset my joy a bit a few weeks later the mcsi put up a new press release in which they stated that the owner had been nailed for illegally selling investment opportunities not only did they have to pay back the investors the founder of the company ended up paying out of his pocket to reimburse them ever since then its been very rare that ive analyzed spam sure theres tons out there yes theyre annoying pernicious and the spammers are probably a rather large festering pimple on the collective ass of humanity but when you get results like that you just cant really top it and a part of you doesnt even want to try you know tldr we are samurai the keyboard cowboys and all those other people who have no idea whats going on are the cattle

since i havent made any acts of revenge as sweet as this maybe the worst thing i did was tag along while my roommates poured water into another cunty exroommates new benz she got from her sugar daddy when she forgot to close the sunroof not to mention its kind of a reminiscence for my late father rip gordon c w tldr dad moved up to portland developed health issues sold house to a complete schmuck since his house was nearly impossible to sell made sure schmuck had a bad time when he moved in after schmuck harassed him back story ampnbsp in my dad moved up to portland due to cheaper housing prices but nobody else was in a position to move i had a business raking in pretty good money other personal reasons my grandma got seniledementia and needed roundtheclock care right as he was closing escrow but when she stabilized we couldnt afford to bring her up since now she needed meds and wed have to pay outofpocket for her transition that left my stepmom to go up there with him but she divorced years later so in late it was just him and bengal cats to make things worse he was a levelheaded guy but his health rapidly deteriorated with arterial collapse high blood pressure that he had every single side effect from including depression and thoughts of suicide that he acted on that never went away his full physical never tested his blood sugar but it skyrocketed to on one er visit and all the complications that came with it and cancer as the cherry on top with the medical bills he couldnt sustain a job due to frequent hospitalization and was on disability and around my computer repair business collapsed and got a job that can barely sustain myself let alone have a budget to go out there and at least visit the poor guy for the weekend so he had no choice but to sell the house at the same time the housing market slowed down especially portland there was a crack house up the street that devalued the neighborhood my dad had a knack for kitschy dcor wasnt particularly tasteful he was on the medical marijuana program so the house always smelled like chron and had a few plants growing and last but not least since he couldnt even afford to move he had to depend on the proceeds of the house to afford his new living arrangements all of that made his house a hard one to sell so after months he finally sells off the house to this guy that was a bit of a prick from the getgo but beggars cant be choosers the contract said to give him days after closing escrow to move out but instead of waiting for that th day the new owners loads up a uhaul the split second it closed escrow parks it in front of the house and instead of nicely helping my frail stillrecoveringfrom cancer they even go as far as breaking in and goading him my dad even almost shot him since he thought he was a burglar of course getting portland pd involved was useless as they said it was a civil issue instead of treating it as harassment the revenge ampnbsp me a few of my friends that knew his plight and of course his buddies put our heads together and put up all sorts of ways to screw with the house he pissed and crapped in most of the hvac floor vents ampnbsp threw clumps of his cats excrement into the hvac vents as well which owing to the smell it gave them carte blanche to pisscrap on the vents too ampnbsp went into the attic and hid a cheap mp playerspeakers above the master bedroom to turn itself on that played a creepy sound like scratches animal noises and even spooky laughs every few hours at night by getting a timer for the speakers to turn on at am then i made a hour long silent mp track and sent it via dropbox i spent the entire afternoon walking him through it all over the phone and teamviewer on his computer and its probably the most expensive and involved prank but its worth it ampnbsp removed the pins from certain door hinges ampnbsp unscrewed the faucet aerators just enough to jet out if you turn it on ampnbsp subscribed to every gay porno mag controversial publication we can think of such as nambla and kkk to be sent to that address ampnbsp poured stump out on the larger trees one of his friends was a gardener who of course specialized in stump removal and ampnbsp dumped a few open cans of tuna between the wall studs
this happened last week and the details may be a bit off since it was told by my dad all acronyms used here refer to either the company or company owner based on the context my dad is a network consultant and distributor his work involves selling and maintaining wireless equipment and providing communication solutions a few months ago he was bidding for a multi million dollar government project competing against rivalcompanyrc and evilcompanyec rc and ec were friends as they sourced from the same manufacturer a bit of background info when my dads company dc first started him and rc were good friends as they both sourced equipment from the same manufacturer after dc grew my dad switched to a different manufacturer and slowly dc and rc started turning into rivals however my dad was a diplomatic guy and always maintained friendly relationships with rc one of the requirements for being eligible for the project was that the company bidding needed to possess a special certificatenot sure of the name but it was a huge process to obtain but a company without the certificate could lease it from another company possessing the certificate for a short period of time or if two companies worked together only one of the companies needed to be certified only rc and dc had the certificate since ec was bidding via rc working together they didnt require a certificate so if ec won they would share the profits with rc as they only got in through rcs certificate so the bidding begins and all the companies produced a quote ec produced the lowest quote and won now dc also a consultant which meant once the bidding was finished he would go through the winning companys quote to see if it was feasible to be implemented and surprisingly the winning bid was so low that even going by bare minimum the company would actually be losing money my dad knew about the agreement between rc and ec and decided to have a talk with the owner of rc gtdc any reason why youre losing out money on this project rc what do you mean losing out were making a nice profit dc are you sure you might want to take a look at your bid over here rc this wasnt what we agreed on hold on i need to check rc called back a few hours later gtrc i cant reach ec hes in a meeting dc you have a bigger problem to deal with right now the bid has no mention of your company hes taken it on as a standalone company rc thats impossible he doesnt even possess the certificate dc your company leasing out the certificate tells a different story rc no way i never authorized that these have got to be forged documents now the way things work here is that if you have a dispute with the bid youll have to file a claim and an enquiry would be launched which painstakingly slow and inefficient due to the number of authorities involved and my dad cant testify to this as discussing the winning bid is illegal gtrc you have to do something dc youre in luck his equipment is not capable of providing coverage to the entire district and its really outdated ill bring this up in the board meeting after that my dad attended the meeting and brought up the problems in ecs equipment which made the government official reject ecs bid and hold a new project bid this gave enough time for rc to file a report the report went through dc won the contractyay ec was banned from participating from further projects and a few charges were filed i guess and the alliance between ec and rc ended tldr company tries to screw over friend gets teamed up by friend and rival
the previous situation back when i was around years old i had this friend tom who had major issues with his physical education professor hed been going to the same middleschool nonus since he was years old and through some odd cosmic joke every year hed been assigned to the same professor one that clearly had it out for him personally you see tommy wasnt particularly athletic or fit im not saying he was lazy or in poor physical condition he just wasnt the type for gymnastics or sports this teacher on the other hand had this r lee erneytype of i will motivate you private pylekind of mentality that well just didnt work with the likes of tommy hence for tom the last four years comprised a veritable litany of verbal abuse poor grades yes gymnastics classes are graded in holland and assorted petty crap directed at him by this dickcheese gunnerysergeant wannabe tommy was always able to deal with crap he was dishedout by being a stone cold vindictive bastard im not even kidding all this happened years ago and im somewhat afraid of him finding out i typed out and posted this story they say an elephant never forgets anything well my childhood friend tommy would make the average elephant look like a mentally handicapped alzheimers patient this cute little boy had the power to hate i went to another school than him so i was never fully aware of the tensions between him and st sgt fuckface other than the occasional fuming recap of the crap the bastard had put tommy through recently and the subsequent my vengeance shall be terriblespeech but nothing ever seemed to happen i chalked this up to him taking the high road forgiving the bastard his transgressions and continuing with his life oh how mistaken i was the setup tommy was now in his final year on middle school and it seemed that staff sergeant dickcheese was showing signs of relenting the profs unholy crusade showed signs of petering out and a semblance of normalcy had been established toms grades were ok nothing fancy but he was going to graduate and as such he applied to join the committee organizing the graduation party looking back this shouldve suprised everyone as he was in no way shape or form the kind of kid to join any committee group or organization that involved doing anything else than smoking pot or listening to music but hey to be really honest me and his other friends didnt really think anything of it we chalked it up to him liking a particular girl in said committee or some other juvenile crap like that and left him to it we were wrong you see the graduation party was to take place in the schools auditorium so all tables desks and chairs normally placed there had to be moved into the gymnasium for storage and that was toms angle to sabotage subvert and defile his archnemesis lair the gymnasium six weeks prior to the party tommy started saving up his allowance no more cigarettes and pot just a steadily increasing amount of cash money on the day of the party this had reached the equivalent of around us burning a hole in his pockets on graduation day tom had spent most of his afterschool day hauling furniture from the auditorium to the gymnasium stacking desk upon desk and chair upon chair and he had been tremendously enthusiastic about it too so much so that the principal had given him the keys to the gymnasium ordering him to lock it once done and make sure nobody would get locked in as the school would be closed for summerrecess after the party was finished so now tom had everything he needed for his plot of vengeance access to the gym a stack of desks to use as makeshift scaffolding and in cash the revenge during a small break tom went to the local butchers shop and spent on as many assorted meatstuffs as het could get his hands on he came back to school with something like pounds of meat ranging from chicken and turkey to steak and pork he then spent the entire night stashing this meat every place he could think of over the ceiling tiles inside of the lockers he even crammed minced meat into the tubing of the wallmounted climbing racks and then he left handing over the keys to the principal and going home the effects over summer tom and i had a bit of a falling out and as i didnt have any other friends going to that school i never heard about the implications of toms actions that is until my kid brother started going to that same school some years onwards it turned out that the day after summer recess the teacher that inspired the whole action had also been the one to open the gymnasium postsummer recess the gymnasium remained closed for two more weeks while the cleanup crews had to rip out the ceiling most of the walls and bin the majority of the implements of sports usually found in a highschool gymnasium as for the legacy of tons actions the horrors he brought upon the now retired professor have been spoken about in hushed tones ever since finding their way into middleschool lore i heard that one day mr soandso opened the gymnasium after a vacation and was assaulted by myriads of stinging insects i heard that once he opened the doors he was assailed by a stench so putrid his hairs went white and he never could smell again ah to be so young again legal action was attempted but failed due to lack of proof or so i was told tldr professor picks on student for four years student hides meat throughout gymnasium and leaves it there over summer recess biology ensues edit i accidentaly a word and a couple of enters cause formatting

i had a shitty neighbor his property abutted the rear lol words rite of mine he was a bitter old shit who spent his time in his extensive vegetable garden on our property line an italian guy the kind whose homegrown tomatoes probably made his famous red sauce we were a young family at the time just the first wave of new people starting to gentrify the workingclass neighborhood we had a fixerupper and a baby we didnt have much money to work with that first summer so i spent a lot of time in the yard doing my best to landscape the overgrown jungle left by the previous owners i basically ripped everything out until we had a lawn we had record rainfall that summer and everyones property had standing water that old shitdribbler starts screaming at me one day while working out back i cant understand half of it because its a mix of old man gibberish and italian apparently he was blaming my removable of massive weeds on my property for flooding his garden it didnt have anything to do with the regular deluges of rain we were getting or that our properties were at the bottom of a hill once my attempt at reasoning had worn out i ignored him turned up my headphones and went back to work i was ripping out the last long stretch of weeds and laying grass seed along the rear property line the next day we get a knock on our door its a city inspector asking us to show them the drainage we installed without a permit i had no idea what they were talking about so i asked how they knew about it they claimed they couldnt say but they wanted to see the rear property line i had worked on yesterday i simply told them that i had not installed drainage i had removed weeds and seeded pointing out the supposed drainage location i indicated that no one in their right mind would install drainage there they agreed and left the plot curdled slightly i should mention that this wasnt just me that old shitswallower had a similar demeanor with his other abutting neighbors one of them was a harddrinking carpenter who lived next to me and he recommended that i just offer to beat the fuck out of that old shitbagger like he did the last time that old shitsharter complained to him apparently that was the reliable standard in the neighborhood i however was not interested in beating up an old shitshrifter who was clearly all too happy to run to the city with lies i went about my business until that old shitstrainer yelled at my wife and baby while they were alone in the yard one day my mother was helping at the house and went outside to see what was happening that old shitsharpie screamed at my mother too old man spittle incomprehensible words surprising volume shaking jowls etc well fuck him the old neighborhood may have opted to beat the shit out of that old shitsundae but he was quite clearly too full of shit for anyone to ever completely beat the shit out of him i pulled some money from other house projects and i built a fence it was a gorgeous suburbanite fence it was made out of resin a brilliant white and installed professionally by fenceers it was a perfect white picket fence the american dream of fencing a beacon of gentrification hope in the middle of a workingclass neighborhood of overgrown yards and cars on blocks i have a muricaboner just thinking about it except for that old shitsargeant our shared property line did not get a white picket fence our shared property line got an foot tall solid security fence i watched him that day from my window as that old shitmilker stood in his garden and glared at the workers installing the resin equivalent of the berlin wall along our property line and his beloved garden that old shitslapper may have noticed the temperature dropping because his entire garden was now cast in shadow i waited at the window most of that day i watched his garden i watched him in his garden i watched him wait for the sun to come back the sun did not return to his tomatoes with his gaudy landscaping of cheap waterfalls ornamental trees and various other tasteless crap and my new fence his garden no longer had much sun exposure the weather got colder the fall and winter passed and i saw less and less of that old shitminion i saw him replant the next season but i rarely saw him outdoors after that year his garden was meager according to my view from our second floor when i started this post i told you that i had a shitty neighbor the following winter i saw someone new in that old shitnibblers yard i never saw that old shitsmokers family presumably because his attitude towards his neighbors carried over to his family i greeted the newcomer thinking he had just moved in it turned out that he was that old shithustlers son and that that old shitjockey had deteriorated over the year and had to be moved to a care facility im assuming he died that year because a new family moved in during the summer i removed the security fencing and replaced it with picket to match the rest of the property good fences make good neighbors

alright this story more or less comprises the last two years of my life im currently a mathcompsci or possibly compsec major intending on going to a major university on a scholarship as part of a rather poorly thought out and even more poorly executed plan to improve standards i had to take junior and senior math from the new teacher she was terrible you see this particular teacher had absolutely no understanding of math whatsoever the school required her class unofficially the principal was an even bigger prick than her but you cant in em all junior year because of the act you should have seen how scores tanked this was bad because beyond being an idiot she was a selfrighteous proud whiny bigot for example she has a habit of trying to bully students who disagree with her into submission strike one she also likes multiple choice tests so do i the problem is that her tests rarely have the correct answers as an option strike two she also had no idea how to teach the math a single simple example problem would take minutes or until a student figured out how to do it and solved it for her otherwise class was just trying different methods to solve a problem over and over again she loved the phrase and thats how you dont solve this problem with a big cheesy grin we heard that eight or ten times a class strike three turkey now i took her class junior year and muddled through it bored out of my mind irritated because she would fail me on the same assignments that my friends had aced i copied an assignment once just to see what the shift was she usually dropped my grades by thirty or forty points on average i tutored the other students in the class trying to help them pass for which i got a detention and a stern talking to i also failed the assignment for cheating senior year would be different first semester of class i did nothing but cause her pain id gotten a guaranteed full ride from the aforementioned university so i knew she couldnt touch me the time she spent trying to solve a problem id solve it in fifteen seconds or so in my head tell the guy behind me who would then write it down and then proceed to make sarcastic remarks and making fun of her general stupidity to the other students eventually id get bored and sleep until the guy behind me woke me up and nodded meaning that theyd finally solved the problem and i had been right she got incredibly desperate towards the end trying to expel me for insubordination trying to make me repeat high school by failing me please i had eight math credits to trying to bring the principal in to bully me into agreement up until she tried to expel me i was playing nice she treated me like crap i treat her like crap we can both hate each other then this happened i should note that my mother teaches math at a local university and is second or third from the head of the department about this time she gets involved and starts being an observer using this as an opportunity to shred the teachers remaining reputation while we filled out letter after letter to the school board and i threw out via the internet and school board meetings the general incompetency of the teacher im friends with a number of school board members by second semester id had enough and dropped the class she relaxed on everyone else and found out she had been fired its hard to come back from that tldr idiot teacher tries to get pushy i get her ass fired edit i only managed to drop the class because i was friends with the school board many people couldnt drop her class even though they had the credits and they didnt need it a lot of people lost scholarships and took huge hits to their gpa due to this teachers unfairness and bullying i know at least two students that lost full rides to major private colleges

about years ago a friend of mine was being bullied online by her boyfriends ex and her friends they were commenting on her appearance calling her a slut basically typical mean girl comments they were really going after her and a friend who was tried to defend her literally an entire thread of insults and hate the girl who was posting most of the insults we can call her jess was a friend of mine until she did something similar to me after watching this barrage of hate unfold for about days yours truly decided to step in and try to end it i was moving out of state in a few weeks anyways so i really wasnt worried how i would be perceived by anyone in my town anyways so i really let all these girls know exactly what i thought of them basically i called everyone who insulted my friend out on their personality flaws i went the extra mile with jess however telling her she would probably never do anything worthwhile with her life i told her you will probably end up staying in my town for the rest of your life working the same or some similar crappy job she was a server because you dont bring any other value to society other than petty drama a little harsh i know but i didnt care it needed to be said fast forward to this weekend when i came to visit some friends we decided to go out for dinner before we start the night time festivities when we arrived at the diner guess who is going to be our server this evening the look of shame on her face was enough for me to know that karma does exist i didnt say much to her certainly nothing mean this time but she was being very passiveaggressive towards me when it was time to pay the bill i signed my receipt and left a small note at the bottom that said dont you just hate that i was right
so did anyone see the art critique freak out video it might be faked but that sort of thing really does happen i used to be an art student computer graphics at a stupid expensive art school and ive experienced a freak out much worse than that first hand art critique story time if you want it have you all seen the dove commercial so to sum that up the women in that commercial describe themselves as uglier than they really are the artists draws their description and they leave another person comes in and describes the same woman with more accurate detail usually much prettier than the woman describing herself well there was this girl in my first drawing class who had the opposite problem shed draw really well rendered self portraits of herself much skinnier and better looking which is fine normally but she also distorted major features like eyelashes the drawing had big thick ones while she had none and fuller lips hers were very thin she looked a lot more like a relative of the honey boo boo family red hair again its totally fine if thats how she wants to see herself no one commented on it for a long time but the problem with her she would point out to many other girls your cheeks look a bit thin in your drawing i think you should have drawn your jaw line softer just underhanded and hypocritical remarks the professor would point out that other peoples drawings had less issues than she was pointing out she kept contradicting him though im still convinced that the prof decided to get his revenge on the final assignment the final would be a fully finished self portrait if the class couldnt tell who the portrait belonged to it couldnt get more than a cit was of our final grade over the class her portraits had been becoming more and more distorted not resembling her or anyone that could even be related to her the final colored portraits were due and they were handed in a pile the prof picked them up and placed them on the wall most of them were easily recognizable except for hers it was a portrait that looked like scarlett johanson the guy next to me said i didnt know scarlett johanson was in the class i dont think anyone honestly even knew it was honey boo boo girls portrait the features had warped so much from her last homework it was sort of unexpected so the prof asked whos is this honey boo boo stood up with this shit eating grin to announce it was hers he opened the floor to critique and reminded us for the first time ever that our participation grade will be impacted based on our ability to critique everyones finals meaning we had to lay into her or watch our grades suffer we had to say what he wanted to but would get in trouble for it took the whole class verbally laying into her portrait for minutes before she broke down started lashing out at some of the more attractive girls in the classroom for putting so much pressure on herfor just existing apparently eventually several people started attacking her back until one person called her fat and she lost it objectively she was fat she cried and cried but didnt want to give up the spotlight she just stood there sputtering and basking in all the negative attention sort of funny to note the guys in the room backed off as soon as she started crying i think the girls saw through her bullshit and kept up the defense the professor just sat there with the best poker face i have ever seen in my life the professor ended the last class early since she wouldnt do the sensible thing and just leave it sort of sucked since i didnt get a critique on my final but it was worth the show she ended up getting a c in the class i think despite her portraits all being really well rendered tldr honey boo boo keeps drawing herself like a supermodel shes difficult with everyone in the class during critiques professor gets the class to critique her final self portrait as hard as shes been critiquing everyone else she explodes when class predictably turns on her edit so someone figured out my personal information through stalking my reddit account and threatened to use it to get me fired it looks like ill have to delete this so long reddit account of years

prologue as any normal person i dealt with some bullying coming through elementary and middle school in high school this intensified as i was relatively new to the area i remember one upperclassmen kyle made it his duty to torment me he would trip me in the hallway tease me and he even defaced my posters when i ran for student council this bullying culminated one day when he threatened me with a bb gun he stupidly brought it to school and busied himself with shooting the walls in one of the regular student hang outs at the time i had thought nothing of it eventually he began aiming the gun at students and firing so bbs would bounce of the walls and hit them soon enough he targeted me i was not having it that day i had just lost the election and i placed my student council loss on him and his upperclassmen friends i asked him to stop but he continued to fire bbs near my legs things escalated quickly as i literally stood up to him one of my friends tried to pull me back saying hes just an asshole man lets just go i couldnt deal i told him to stop he paused for a moment then aimed the gun at my face he had a female friend beside him she tried to settle him down and pleaded with him to stop he didnt do anything kyle stop it i remember his smug face in detail as he held that bb gun on me he asked me why dont you make me i had no good response i thought to myself you messed up man here was your moment to stand up to him and youve got nothing at the last second i said why dont you shoot me then pussy he smiled as a i stood there and raised the bb gun back on me i didnt even think about moving then nothing he chickened out his female companion got up to leave and he followed i had won this round the revenge it was a few weeks on when my dad amp i pulled into our local gas station to fuel up dad twisted off the fuel cap grabbed the pump handle and squeezed to begin filling but nothing cameout these were days when we transitioned from postpay to prepay then i heard a familiar voice over the gas station pa system hey guys thats not how it works anymore you have to come in this was said in perhaps the smuggest tone i have ever heard in my life so far as we walk in i see that it is kyle and i immediately formulated a plan that night i went to a walmart and bought spray paint and gloves with some cash i dont even know why they let that slide i was still under at the time i dressed in a black outfit when i got home and slinked over to the gas station it was closed all over the clean white paint of the building i wrote kyles name not just his first name his full name first middle and last i wrote it on the front of the building the back of the building and the sides i wrote it in cursive and in regular script it was beautiful i felt some regret about it when i had got home but i stopped worrying when i thought of who i retaliated against the conclusion kyle lost his job we were even he didnt even bother me anymore i dont think he ever suspected me a couple days later my spray paint art was covered with some whitewash epilogue things got better as high school went on i made a bunch of friends and was elected to student council the next year i guess you need to prove your mettle when you move to a small town edit in the future i will be mindful of others when plotting revenge in the end i think my act caused very little collateral damage a gallon of white exterior paint costs id just hope that they got kyle to paint over my handiwork himself before they let him go 
sorry for the wall of text there will be a tldr at the bottom background it was the summer after i finished fourth grade i was at my daycare days a week because my parents both worked full time there was a kid that liked to physically abuse me and all the other kids at the daycare he was definitely a troubled kid he had adhd and took meds daily for it i asked the teachers why he took meds everyday and it was explained to me during the summers his parents would let him skip taking meds because he acted like a zombie understandable iyam while kid was off his meds he would beat on me and others relentlessly he was a year younger than me and inches shorter and i had been going to this daycare since preschool so it was expected of me to know not to retaliate to him but rather walk away and rat him out which i did but there is only so much a daycare aid can do to control a wild child anyway over the years ive been around this kid i had received bruised ribs and one broken one a broken toe and minor cuts and scrapes other kids got hurt as well knocked down from trees shoved sand in eyes you knowthe classic little kid bully shit we put up with a lot and this kid only got time out it was obvious every kid hated this little bag of dicks which lead to the teamwork needed to defeat this kid once and for all the catalyst im playing in the dirt by myself doing who knows what im a bored kid i dont know wtf i was doing anyways this little shithead comes up to where im at and destroys whatever i was making i get pissed off hey man it was my dirt creation and ill be damned is this little fuck will bully me forever i get up and shove him away and say fuck you dude leave me alone heck yea that will teach him the end of my suffering is now the little dickbag runs away im victorious i go back to my dirt and begin trying to rebuild whatever it was i hear running behind me i turn my head to see that bastard running at me with scissors from a teachers office in his hand im fucked he jumps at me and lodges the scissors about an inch into my thigh right though my jeans and leaves them in there and runs off the ultimate winner i cry my parents come and take me to the hospital blah blah blah you know how it goes next day im back at daycare quarantined in a teachers office for the next weeks till my leg heals enough for me to be able to play around without pain i was not being punished i was there to heal during those weeks of what to me seemed to me like punishment my rage grew i will kill this kid he will know real pain when im out of this office weeks go by and im ready for some sweet revenge i plot with my oldest friends to get the teacher distracted from the play area so i can have some one on one time with satans son the dickbag if you didnt figure it out my friends will hop the brick fence while the teacher is watching and run off in different directions my friends like the plan and agree it is worth the punishment to get back at the kid the revenge im in the playground so is that little bastard i signal to my friends to execute the plan they jump the fence the teacher watching the play area runs off to go get my friends im alone with that fuckerfinally i immediately run at him while he is playing in the sand box i get a good kick right in his face he gets knocked flat damn that was too quick but oh well i wont beat him while he is down he knew he had it coming i turn around and walk away leaving him to his sobbing victory is mine suddenly i fall to the ground that fucker kicked me from behind right in the ding dong one of those kicks with the tip of your shoe that just smooshes the balls right to your taint im fucked i cant get up he runs off as i struggle to regain my breath and dignity as i start to get up defeated that fucking kid comes back with one of those huge push brooms and proceeds to hit me with the bristle end not causing much damage but definitely building up my rage and adrenaline after a couple whacks i stop his next swing and punch in right in the sniffer i broke his nose i heard it and it was later confirmed to me blood on my hands and him sobbing and bleeding on the ground ill be damned if he gets up this time i run off and grab one of those big wheel tricycles lift it over my head and deliver the most powerful hulk smash a th grader could deliver the little fuck goes limp and begins doing that loud screamcrying the teacher is back with my friends to find a bloody little shithead on the ground and me standing over him victorious proud of what ive done i gladly get taken to the office to be scolded and have my parents called to take me home my dad arrives hears the story from the teachers threatens me with the worst belt whooping ive ever had and takes me home as soon as we get inside the car he turns to me and says in the most serious tone today you learned to defend yourself this is the only time i will not punish you for fighting i respond with silence and just stare at my feet my dad then says with the biggest smile hot damned you kicked the shit outa that kid though huh the parents never brought that kid back to daycare i returned as a king of the playground tldr kid abused me for years eventually stabbing me with scissors sending me to the hospital i kick the shit out of him and bash him with a tricycle edit formatting
this story is fairly recent last summer to be precise i went up to a big name college to take some summer courses and the college gave me an apartment with three other people taking the same classes i got along really well with two of them lets call them jeff and mark but the third one we will call john was constantly getting on my nerves let me explain the living situation to get a better understanding there are two bedrooms a shared kitchen bathroom and living room my real roommate was john we got along fine at first but he never understood basic common courtesy things like not staying up till am with all the lights on watching tv while your roommate is trying to sleep this happened more than once i needed to wake up at to make my lab time i would find myself kicking him out of the room and he acted like i was the bad guy after a while we got a chore list together so the house would be somewhat clean and no one was doing more than someone else it was all fair and on paper it worked the list was mostly rules on doing the dishes you use it you clean it if you didnt clean it which would happen to us all you just clean the sink out once a day and it revolved between the four of us unless the dishes werent yours at all simple right not for john he would never wash his dishes and used double the dishes as the rest of the house so what happened when it was his turn to clean the sink out he just didnt do it saying he has too much work do to his classes that was the biggest bullshit we have ever heard we all have the same classes there is no difference whatsoever we could still find time to clean and work on projects giving him the benefit of the doubt i believed him thinking that maybe it takes him longer to get homework done this was not the case seeing how far he was with the homework i found him watching tv books unopened and work not even started this is an hour after asking him to do the dishes so he clearly had enough time and then some because he never even started his homework that night and just played xbox and watched tv the rest of us went home for break and left his dishes in the sink hoping he would finally pull his weight we were surprised when we got back to find them done but soon learned he didnt do them his mother did his parents live hours from the college and she came up to visit but instead cleaned his mess he is by the way and his mother was still picking up after him we couldnt believe it weeks pass and jeff mark and i never left any dishes in the sink because we were tired of the mess and how disgusting it looked but john didnt care he still left uncleaned dishes in it within a week it was filled with johns crap to the point where it was unusable we had it we told him we would stop driving him to class if he didnt clean his share he didnt and had to walk to class for a couple of days no progress i changed the password on my router so he couldnt use it and be without internetall homework and projects must be submitted online still he didnt care then we gathered all of his dishes and put them in a garbage bag and threw it on his bed hoping he would get the hint still being dense asshat he was he did not clean them the crap then soaked through the bag and onto his bed this then made him clean them this took weeks for him to finally pull his weight from then on we just had to mention a garbage bag and he would suddenly find time to do his chores tldr roommate never cleaned his dishes dishes found a new home in his bed
i dont post on this sub however i usually quite enjoy the stories i couldnt find a better place to put this so heres the flip side of the coin of revenge so a couple days ago i had a friend over weve known each other since high school but weve only ever just been friends she and i decided to hang out at my place and it was fun the next day i wake up to my car covered in spray paint like hood roof lights doors windows fucking grill everything now i used to have some enemies but ive long since grown up and become a chill dude so i couldnt imagine why someone would do this the writing said dont touch her ill kill you seriously so i was concerned enough to call the cops they show up i fill some shit out and we find the spray can thrown into the bushes near the car as the officer and i are discussing possible suspects or lack of we are approached by a nice old lady she asks me are you the owner of this vehicle to which i admitted she asked me if i knew a tiffanyname changed because duh and i run over to my car there it was in huge white lettering tiffany and then it clicked she had broken up with her ex a month ago and it turns out he lives down my street he must have seen us getting in and out of my car when she came over and decided in his infinite wisdom to fuck with my life i text tiffany and it turns out she received a text the night before that was from her ex it appeared at first glance to be a pic of him with cum on his chest but upon closer inspection we noticed it was bright white and drippy as fuck paint he had fucking paint on his chest so now because some piece of shit year old manchild thought i was seeing his exdecided i deserved a new paint job i have to deal with potentially thousands of dollars in damages here are pics for proof and i dont think this post breaks the rules however if it does let me know if anyone cares about the current status of the case the warrant for his arrest is supposed to be submittedactive today i get a free meter restraining order and if i see this piece of shit in person im breaking both his arms d update i fucking cleaned my car this happens again im blinding him with acetone so heres my car and and im so fucking done with this 
im a big guy not huge but strong but this story takes place in eighth grade football at the time i was roughly and lbs and i would routinely go up against lb linemen i played left tackle and win this story took place during one of the last games of the season before the championships the team i was on was the bucaneers and lets say i played against the vikings the half back from the vikings was a total douche i knew from school he was the most popular player on their team because he was a good player and would relentlessly harass anyone who wasnt good enough you know the type he was a dick to everyone disrespected coaches teachers parents girls boys and thought the world owes him everything now during the bucviking game the bucs were losing very badly im talking in the fourth quarter the situation was utterly hopeless and our coach told us that we had a good game and to not feel bad for ourselves so yeah we were toast the last thing any of us wanted to do was go back out and get destroyed another play but we were in our own yard zone and nobody wanted the score to get any worse we hobble over get set and the vikings run a new trick play in the last quarter with absolutely no hope of being beaten on a team whose already given up dick move in the first place right they get a touchdown and the crowd goes wild except for our parents who are just shouting good job at this point and ive been tripped in the mob that is the line which is not normal because normally im standing over the other guy helping him up i was a weird football player well guess who carried the ball for this touchdown thats right mcdouche the halfback he stands up he spikes the ball and he screams his best victory screech i look over at the sideline and mcdouche kicks me in the back of the head it was not an accident because hes staring at me smiling im pissed i yell for the ref saying that this idiot just kicked me in the head kick him out of the game he just says he didnt see it sorry mcdouche laughs at me and we go to the kickoff we end up actually scoring within mins of game time after this incident forgot to mention it after we score its time for another kickoff i line up the kickoff starts and my friend the kicker launches it up into space giving me plenty of time to get underneath the ball im sprinting as fast as i can at the kid that just caught the pigskin because the football god was on my side that night mcdouche was about to catch the ball i sprint at the little fucker as fast as i can i avoid the first line of defense comprised of linemen leaning into the hit and dropping my shoulder gets me through the second line of defense and footwork gets me around the third i pour on speed and anger of the entire night waiting for him to catch the ball mcdouche gets it and he sprints to the right not seeing the little ball of hate that is speeding towards him as fast as humanly possible i saw through his helmet that smug little smile of his from catching the ball turn to a look of horror as he catches sight of me mcdouche plants his foot and skids in fear trying to protect the ball from the purple jersey in front of him its too late i launch from a full tilt sprint straight through the air with my shoulders at his chest and my helmet aimed at the ball my metal face guard caught his hand it was sandwiched between a football and two sprinting football players connecting at mph he does a backflip landing on his head i slide over him and not so gracefully sprawl across the turf behind him i saw stars i turn around and hes dropped the football curled up in pain holding his arm the coaches come out on the field the games stopped and the ambulance is called hes crying on the field in front of half the middle school i attended hes humiliated later that night i learn that i connected with him so hard so perfectly that i shattered bones in his hand and i slept like a king edit forgot to mention it was later in the game they scored th quarter we drove ball back and this was next kickoff
i dont know if this should go under rjusticeporn or rpettyrevenge ill let you decide i own and operate a delivery service delivery hot tubs furniture and pool tables ive been doing about eleven years or so like any job it has its ups and downs and more than a fair share of conflicts there were conflicts frequently between me and the stores i delivered for employees and assistants ive hired and customers whove hired me through the years this is a tale of a bitch a drugged out chemically adled bitch it was four years ago i was doing a pool table setup near st louis followed by a hot tub delivery between st louis and the lakes as per normal i had to collect a considerable amount of money from these customers which had to be dropped off at the business that hired me at the lake of the ozarks i finished my last job around pm and arrived at the business to drop off my collections around pm the store knowing how accomodating i was toward them asked if id be interested in delivering a really light sofa to a town up the road they told me it was ten miles away turned out to be thirty so i was a little irritated by the delay and it being in a fairly remote area near the lake i ended up spending extra time trying to locate it after dark i wasnt happy considering the fact i still had a two hour drive ahead of me before arriving home i end up finding the place i knock on the door and discover that ive delivered during dinner time for the people i apologize for how long it took to find them and asked if theyd like the sofa deposited in the living room or the garage the man tells me neither and informs me that it has to go down stairs in the sun room he shows me the stairs at which point i inform him that the delivery was a first room of the house or garage delivery a fact they were informed about before i left the store the man is hostile when i tell him this and says he isnt accepting the delivery unless i put it in the sun room i inform him again that it is a garage or living room delivery no stairs i also inform him that it will never fit down the stairs no matter what it is at this point that he leads me over to the side of his house and tells me that ill have to carry it down the side or i can take it back to the store im used to this tactic and any other day it might have worked but i made a lot of money off my first two deliveries and i wasnt making very much off the sofa delivery so im more than happy to take it back to the store the side of the hill he wanted me to carry sofa down in the dark was covered in rocks about the size of my head or bigger an extremely dangerous endeavor i refuse to undertake heres where it gets bizarre i had already taken the sofa off the truck in anticipation of carrying it into the living room or the garage and it is sitting in the driveway he thinks im bluffing and tells me to take the sofa back to the store i inform him thats not a problem but he wont be able to pick it up or return it or exchange it until the delivery fee is paid hes already told me he wasnt paying i reach down to grab the sofa and his wife the woman who bought it jumps on my back and starts clawing my face shes raked my cheek and clawed some pretty deep furrows in the skin in fact i still have some faint scarring from these scratches even today i shrug her off where she lands on the sofa at which point her husband threatens to kick my ass for assaulting his wife he gets in my face cursing at me using every curse word combination he can think of and at this point the red neck in me moves to the forefront of brain and i stand my ground and promise them that i will plant the next person to touch me in the ground im pissed beyond being professional but still i represent the store in this delivery so i politely ask him to have his wife get off the soda by the light of the street lamp i can see that the woman is high as a freaking kite her eyes are glassy her nose is red and i can smell the pot on her and the wine shed been drinking she is out of it for the most part he removes his wife from the sofa and i reach down to grab the sofa again i warn him to control his wife if he cares about her and he calls me a few choice names in reply i mentioned that the sofa was really light so i usually just pick this model up and throw it on my shoulder and carry it where it needs to go this time was no different except for the crazy chick i reached down to grab it again and the woman tried to jump on my back again much to the protest of her husband i had anticipated her doing this again and quickly snatched the sofa the driveway and quickstepped over to the truck she missed me completely and landed face first on the pavement fucking up her grill horribly i mean she messed herself up horribly she didnt stop her self with her hands before she hit she just plowed into the pavement like she was leaping into a pool the man gets pissed and takes a swing at me i step back from him and move toward the front of my truck i do this two more times with his swings going wide each time i didnt want to fight if i could help it so i just kept backing out of range and in doing so i was stepping into frame for the driving cam i used to have in the cab of my truck he tried hitting me about six more times until his wifes crying forced him to abandon his attempt at assault i secured the sofa why he tended to his wife i was parked on the street because his driveway was pretty steep and i had a hot tub trailer attached he told me i better not try using his driveway to turn around or hed drag me out of my truck and beat my ass i inform him that the sofa because of the late hour will be taken back to my shop and would not be released until to the store or him until the delivery fee was paid he told me hed be filing assault charges against me for what i did to his wife i showed him my camera and said please do because i had it on film i didnt realized on the ride home that the camera hadnt been on as i was backing up the street because they lived on a dead end street my trailer jackknifed into a dead snag after pulling forward and back several times i was able to back it up the hill and around the curve into the regular street again it was at this point that i noticed that part of one of the limbs in the dead snagged had broken lose and landed on the shoulder of the road which gave me an idea i back the trailer into the dead snag a couple of times and the top of the tree broke off and blocked about two thirds of the street i got out and with a little grunting and grubbing i was able to pull the tree top across the street enough to block their exiting their block it cost me a taillight on the trailer but it was worth it the sweet justice in this was that my shop that i was storing the sofa in was two hours away in springfield when they finally contacted the store and i explained everything to them the store backed me up and returned their money minus the money for the two hour delivery i charged for taking it to springfield with me well that was my tale of redneck revenge hope you liked it tldr asshole and crazy chick received sweet karma after assaulting me during delivery
so ill start by saying that i am a jr ref at my local airsoft field which i will not name just for the fact that it is going to court anyway im but a very respected and aggressive player so it begins with us playing a game where you have a certain path to follow and along the path their are key objective buildings that you must capture to move your spawn closer to keep pushing up anywho the next building we have to get is fairly large with three windows facing us one window on each side of the door no ones pushing on our team so i decide to start it and ask for covering fire and run up to the side of the building their were no guns shooting out of the windows at the time this is important later so the doors on the far right side of the building im on the middle left i go to clear and shoot the guy in the right window with my shotgun i move on to the left one and see a kid crouched facing the other way i shoot him and then a person in the corrner that i dident see shoots me in my plate carrie with his rifle point blank ft engagement for fps alright not too big of a deal it happens to me a lot because i tend to scare a lot of people do they act on their instinct i explane that is against the rule to shoot me so close with the rifle he starts babbling on about how i can shoot people so close but he cant ect and how i didnt call my hits when i ran to the building no one was even shooting when i ran i tell him that ill call the hit as long as he does he says somthing and turns like hes going to walk away but in a split second he turns points his rifle at my face and sends rd burst point blank directly to my face two getting caught by my glasses two getting caught by my shmog and one hitting my ear causing bleeding i point him out to the ref and what not he talks to the owner then i get brought in for him to apologized an i told him i do not accept your apology on the grounds that you could have blinded me deafened me taken a tooth out you assaulted me because you did not follow the rules because you decide to be an inconsiderate asswhole who could have ruined my entire future as a functioning human and you are oh so lucky im not sueing you the owner said it was my call weather he gets banned or not at first i told him to not let him back for a while then his friends who were a table away from us started being dicks to my friends and i so i let the owner know that i wish for him and his friends to never be allowed back and during this time the dude threatened a marinearmy colonel dont know for sure other than hes a colonel that he was going to shoot him with a real gun he didnt say it directly to him but to his friends and their were many witnesses so now because of that he his now being reported because of the threat and im now in the process of getting him assault charges btw this dudes im things arnt going to be well for him for a while
several years ago a major hurricane blew through my hometown and the government issued a damage repair to all houses effected by the storm after evaluation through insurance companies something to that extent construction contractors took advantage of the situation going door to door offering their services contractors get money everyone gets free repairs why not whole neighborhoods signed on and work began my parents were getting their home repaired and after a time realized the amount they were quoted for was too high so they planned to break the contract and find someone else to do all the repairs and replace all the shutters and window framing for the same price while on the phone with the contractor he tells them theyre willing to to do all the extra work for free so my parents stay with the original contractors after many many months the work was done and the guys came to collect except they didnt replace the shutters and window framing my father withholds the money because they admit to lying about the extra work in order to keep the contract but refuse to do it because they didnt write up the new contract for my dad to sign so theyre not obligated to do it yet wanted our money this devolved into arguments with them threatening to sue us a couple days later after discussing this with the family we have them over for a meeting and agree to pay them extra but discounted amount to do the shutters and framing they come back and finish the work when the time came for them to receive their pay they visit the house and my mother gives them the check they realize that the amount was for the original work without the additional pay as agreed they get pissed my mother snarkily replies to them that since they didnt sign a revised contract she was not obligated to pay them the extra amount they left without much of a fight tldr get it on paper 
this one is an unorthodox form of revenge though not from the food server but instead a dismayed observer so im out to dinner with some friends and one guy a friend of a friend is being a particular prick as a side note he is known as a real penny pincher a tight ass so to speak always asking for drinks asking for handouts and it turns out that this guy has been rorting our countrys australia welfare system for years i only recently found out so here we are at the restaurant table and he is being racist talking about hitler and using fake german accents in this hungarian restaurantin front of the friendly young hungarian waitress he is complaining about the menu and generally being rude to this poor waitress who is obviously new to the job a backpacker and just being nice whilst no doubt earning very little and not being tipped much we dont tip as much as people in the states so i tell him to stop being an asshole but he wont listen he continues we all as a group scold him for being a prick but he continues time passes and later the waitress brings his dinner which consisted of chicken schnitzel and chips at this point we are all happy because the food is great but of course he then decides to complain and ask the poor waitress to put the chips back in the frier because theyre not cooked enough and to get a new soda because it is diet not regular we sip the soda and all agree he is wrong id had enough pissed off at this guys lack of empathy most likely due to the fact he has never worked in hospitality in fact he doesnt work at all he relies on welfare payouts from the government i decide to seek revenge so as soon as i got home i wrote a long detailed submission to our welfare system dobin program it is basically a website where you can anonymously dob in welfare cheats hes toast i wrote everything i know about the guy including his boasts about rorting money i wrote his name his address his general m o from what ive heard etc feels good
so last night i heard a track that reminded me of the story of revenge im about to share with you guys the track is too many by the beastie boys and nas its a decent cut about poser rappers amongst other things years ago i did a solid for a friend of a friends friend djing for some show they were throwing i think they described it as a stop on a regional tour so i start doing some prep work i ask for some of their instrumentals and theyre taken aback all they had planned and wanted me to do was play their mixtape they called it an album while they rapped over themselves rapping im not sure if i need to explain this or not but this is amateur as fuck and definitely not hiphop at this point i knew it was going to be bad but stuck with it anyway since they said they already sold like tickets it got worse their album despite having decent probably stolen beats is embarassingly cliche it was full of rhymes that were boastful lies mysogyny but worst of all uninspired and uninteresting regardless i work with what i can i figured out some good mixes with my own instrumentals marked some bars i could loop so they could freestyle or work the hype pick out some points i can scratch with i was ready a few days later i get to club and set up but there is no sound engineer whatever i work with the house stuff perform checks and get ready stressing out way too much over all this foreign equipment the time comes for their set and for a good hour these losers were holding people at the door trying to make it look like the place was bumping but in reality it was a ghost town probably hours after i had got there the set finally starts for an entire people the first half went as good as it can go when or douchebags are rapping over the sound of themselves rapping despite them looking like dear headlights when their tracks didnt end there is a quick interlude and i decide im getting paid now i knew they didnt make enough at the door to pay my full fee but i was cool with taking a cut they fucked up by offering me a measely sum that i cant even remember when the second half started i kept working kept up the professionalism but for the last two tracks i had my fun the second to last track i kept my hand on my turntables pitch slider i would speed and slow down the track subtlely to anyone listening they probably wouldnt have noticed but if youre singing over your own song for the umpteenth time you definitely noticed again i give them a chance to actually be mcs with some looped instrumentals and again they cant do it and i cringe i queue the last track and think fuck it and change my turntable to rotate at rpms instead of and guess what those broke clowns stood up there posturing to an empty house singing about how cool they were rapping their last track like chipmunks i dont know why they didnt stop maybe they didnt want people to know they were rapping over their own voices or they were frozen by humiliation dont fuck over your dj especially if youre creativly bankrupt and are a whack rapper passion and inspiration are more important than money but when the money is gone there is no respect
ok so some years ago i was about i think now a friend of mine had a free house so a bunch of guys were gonna head over sink some beers smoke a little play some vidya etc i had just been offered a permanent position at the temp job i was working so i fancied going out for a few drinks first to celebrate but the guys were already at the house which was in a different town no biggie me and my brother will head out for a few drinks then hop on a train and come down to the house we do then we pick up a couple more beers at the shop min train ride before heading to the station the train is at the platform but isnt leaving for a good mins so we grab a table and continue chatting were right at one end of the carriage sat opposite each other with me in the aisle seat facing down the entire length of the carriage i see a group of younger people walking down the carriage towards me a girl then two guys all dressed kinda like scene kids so i dont pay them any attention until the girl without skipping a step walks past and slaps me in the forehead i turn in my chair and start yelling expletives at her along with my brother but she doesnt stop just opens the door to the next carriage and continues through the first guy follows her out but the second guy stops at our table starts running his mouth about how the fuck are you gonna start on a girl and if you want a fucking fight me and my friend will be through there we both try to talk this guy down as were peaceful chaps explain that she slapped me in the face and basically give him the opportunity to walk away but no the tirade of yelling continues well fuck you up dont fucking talk to girls like that yadda yadda yadda later conversations with people about this have pretty much confirmed that the guy was on cocaine firstly because of his mr invincible attitude and secondly because of the sizeable chunk of whitebrown stuff that had formed in the corner of his mouth in an attempt to defuse the situation my brother pointed it out and said dude youve got something on your lip there to which we both chuckle he responds by spitting at us remember i said we were peaceful guys yeah line crossed unfortunately were also both over six foot tall and i think im about st lbs my brother is bigger still we both jump up from our seats and he finds himself face to face with me i swear i saw him visibly shrink quite impressive as he was already a little runt i think the realisation of what he had done finally sank in after a quick mental rundown of ok so youve stood up he spat at you what do we do now i leaned backwards and launched my forehead square into his nose blood exploded everywhere and as he staggered backwards i caught his nose again with a left hook not gonna front my hand hurt for days afterwards but god it was worth it he collapsed into a seat clutching his face while his friend came back into the carriage to get him shaking in both himself and his voice apologising profusely for both of his friends as i said were peaceful guys so i didnt go for him i said not to worry cos he hadnt done anything but i pointed behind him at the girl and said you should bring her in here see what shes caused we bounced off the train after that managed to get back to our house where my brothers gf was having a night in with her sister who i had never met before brilliant first impression explaining the story and then holding out my redstained palms saying thats his blood hahahaha

tldr version up top hunter moore the revenge porn king was probably relieved when he got arrested story at link but im posting the text below for quicker viewing if its in italics then its something i added by bullyville founder every day both kids and adults experience online bullying awareness may be up but unfortunately so are the incidents of harassment how many more tortured young kids will choose to take their own lives rather than face the insecure bullies who get pleasure from ruining theirs hunter moore from the now defunct isanyoneupcom is probably one of the internets most notorious offenders hunter is a selfadmitted bully with a long history of outrageous behavior on abc nightline he proclaimed to be a professional life ruiner when confronted by the village voice about a pending fbi investigation against him moore stated the following i will literally fucking buy a first class fucking plane ticket right now eat an amazing meal buy a gun in new york and fucking kill whoever said that i will burn down fucking the village voice headquarters if you fucking write anything saying i have an fbi investigation and lets not forget about his comment to gawker during an interview and i quote im gonna sound like the most evil motherfuckerlets be real for a second if somebody killed themselves over being on the site do you know how much money id make at the end of the day i do not want anybody to hurt themselves but if they do thank you for the money back in april of this year i convinced hunter to shut down his now infamous isanyoneupcom revenge porn website for a nominal fee hunter was so convincing that he was going to turn over a new leaf and be an advocate against bullying especially underage bullying within hours of that transaction being complete hunter was on twitter cyber bullying kids worse than ever before telling kids that they should kill themselves using vulgar racist language and advocating more violence and revenge i should have known that his attention would eventually turn to me and turn it did moore starved for attention went on an online rampage accusing me amongst other things of being a pedophile i was with my wife and two baby boys when his defamatory tweets came through i shudder to think what the marine in me might have done if hunter was standing right in front of me but you know what thats not the right answer violence is a weak medicine when fighting a bully like hunter moore i took the high road and didnt even bother to respond instead of making an anger fueled decision i studied moore once i looked for his weaknesses they were easy to find brainsoverbullies moores world revolves around his twitter account it was horrifying to see how many of his followers retweeted his defamatory comments with even nastier ones and then came the straw that broke the camels back as if accusing me of pedophilia wasnt bad enough hunter moore threatened to rape my wife while my kids watched he has now been served with a defamation lawsuit and has restraining orders filed against him in two states he can add this to his ever growing criminal record anyone who retweeted hunters pedophile comments and added their own can also expect to be served with a defamation lawsuit internet tough guys are also legally accountable for their actions hunter and some of his followers now realize this along with their parents since some of his followers appear to be under the age of you would think that hunter would have learned his lesson about receiving naked photos of possibly underage girls on his twitter account or via email after the fbi raided his house actually his parents house since he still lives at home hes but apparently not here at bullyville weve decided to turn this darkness into light well soon be launching a brand new site for isanyoneupcom this didnt seem to come to fruition that not only shows the history and eventual dismantling of this disturbing website but also brings valuable information to people who have been wronged by similar behavior we are also putting together a class action lawsuit against hunter on behalf of all the victims from isanyoneup or any other social media that he used to directly harass and intimidate people were doing this mostly for the completely powerless underage women who were verbally harassed after hunter posted their completely naked unedited photos on his site hunter moore pissed me off long before he came after me and my family because he picked on those who he thought couldnt fight back i tried to use positivity to stop that and i actually naively thought it worked now that hes crossed the line with his personal attacks against me and my family theres no turning back i wont let him i once believed that a stint in the military might be a good option to get hunter back on track but unfortunately he became ineligible after his recent arrest for head butting a woman in a nightclub in new york and that sums up what kind of bully he is he preys on those who he perceives as weak but this time hes not getting away with it do i have your undivided attention hunter do you clearly understand what is happening to you right now im standing up to a bully and that bully is you sometimes you have to be a bully to beat a bully im reclaiming the innocence you so recklessly stole from these innocent young girls whose lives youve destroyed strong people stand up for themselves but the strongest people stand up for others im really looking forward to seeing you in court as are some of the underage girls who youve publicly tormented all of the money that we win from these multiple lawsuits against you will be donated to battered womens shelters across the united states let this serve as a constant reminder to you that its never right under any circumstance to hit or disrespect a woman now i realize that you dont have any money but after we win these judgments against you any money you do earn in the future will go towards this charity so you just go right ahead and launch that new website that you keep telling everyone about october st right hunter your investors might as well just write a check to our charity because thats exactly where their money will be going when were done with you oh and the only thing you have left your beloved social media thats going away too your isanyoneup twitter account is going to be shut down shortly and im responsible for that you see hunter youre violating the trademarks that i now have in place for isanyoneup and iau you might want to go read the fine print of that contract you signed remember your lifetime ban from facebook well that also includes any other page you try to hide behind including your current iau community facebook page say goodbye to that as well by the way hunter when youre retweeting the completely nude photos of girls are you verifying that each one of them is at least years of age i didnt think so add that to your list of problems for today you might want to go familiarize yourself with federal penal code usc sect and hunter your tweet about leaking emails between the two of us during the acquisition of your website would be so welcomed assuming you dont create fake email interactions which youve done in the past you will be violating yet again the terms of the agreement which included a confidentiality clause any rational person doesnt believe a word that comes out of your mouth including the amount youre claiming to your fans and the media that your revenge porn website was purchased for once again hunter youre on the main stage enjoy yet another minutes of infamy it will most likely be your last karma is right around the corner anxiously awaiting your arrival this will be the last time i speak to you directly hunter im sure youre going to have some unbelievably intelligent public tweetslies since youre a literary genius looking forward to you supplying additional evidence so the world can see for themselves just who you really are as benjamin disraeli once said courage is fire and bullying is smoke theres a bit more after this but the end result is the evidence this guy gathered and posted in this article led to a judgement against the hunter moore and this was all a while before he was arrested by the feds
i grow weed for a living and in this business we tend to hire by invitation only when i first started i was invited by a friend and for the sake of anonymity well call him jason since i had to quit my parttime job quit school and travel out of state for this opportunity jason let me live with him and his girlfriend while he was supposedly showing me the ropes for nearly two years straight i went to work with jason every single day including holidays we would hop into his loud obnoxious copmagnet of a car what we were doing wasnt exactly legal and drive to each grow site which took anywhere from a few hours up to an entire day if we had to harvest in two years jason taught me nothing he delegated all the hard work to me and blamed me for anything that went wrong even though we basically had the same responsibilities our boss had already fired a couple of guys because they couldnt get along with him i refused to let that happen to me because i knew the marijuana industry was getting bigger and i was determined to get my piece of the pie for two years straight i put up with his shit kept my mouth shut worked incredibly hard and essentially risked my life with this asshole while teaching myself how to grow good weed i could go on forever about the things this fucktard did but you get the point luckily my boss was paying attention and offered me a partnership in california where im originally from this was the big leagues of the marijuana business and my time had come jason was forced to maintain the operation out of state for another six months until he eventually asked for the same deal he was now a partner as well things got out of hand fast for jason his abilities as a marijuana grower were becoming more apparent with each crop the yield kept getting lower his place always seemed to look improperly maintained he couldnt keep track of what he was doing over the course of several weeks and we would have to figure out solutions to his problems after another year of this nonsense i decided enough was enough i devised a plan to subtly plant the idea in my partners mind that jason was embezzling i told a close friend to keep an eye on him for me and let me know what he does since she hangs out with his girlfriend every now and then i would hear stories about jason going to music festivals and then exaggerate the cost of the tickets not that i really had to since theyre expensive as fuck anyway and i would even suggest that he went partying some nights even when i knew he didnt and with each little drop of poison to jasons name i added into my partners ear there would be a phone call made to jason about progress at work which usually led to a heated conversation about his usefulness to the company and other shortcomings i went at this for months until he finally agreed that jason should be kicked out of the business i felt like andy dufresne escaping shawshank after having just crawled through a river of shit as an added bonus my partner was entitled to half of jasons equipment after we kicked him out about worth all of which was offered to me for free tldr lazy dumbfuck is a constant pain in the ass while im a lowly employee i become my own boss and start a chain of events that leads to his subsequent unemployment edit i think i have to remind everyone that it is legal to grow marijuana in california depending on where you live and although marijuana possession and cultivation is still a federal crime i think reddit would agree that those laws will inevitably change
i was laid off temporarily one winter during my off time i got a phone call from a guy i knew a few years earlier kind of a goodfornothing but generally harmless he told me hed started a painting business and had a huge contract and could use any help he could get fast and knew i was off and might want some work he was based out of a city about miles away so he said i could stay with him if i wanted hes got room so i took him up on it i get there and the guy doesnt have a truck and asks if we can use mine his is in the shop total bs he didnt even have one but i didnt know that yet we go to the first house to painthe really did have a contract to paint several houses and he points me to where hed like me to start i have painting experience and he knows it so i dont need a lot of supervision but i dont notice him doing anything at all just going to the bathroom every minutes or so well it becomes obvious pretty fast guys got himself a coke problem to the point where he cant do any work just gotta inhale powder all day now i dont begrudge a man his substances coke weed acid alcohol whatever as long as youre meeting your responsibilities and not dragging down others around you over the next couple of weeks he hired a couple more people who came and went and didnt get paid for their short stints but both those people were to be fair absolutely terrible and caused more damage than they were worth so not paying them was reasonable over those couple of weeks when hed get good and high hed get talkativeas blow tends to do to a person and hed let slip how he cant have any utilities in his name cause he owes them all hundreds or even thousands of dollars phone internet electricity water gas even car insurance somehow the works hes got a good girl gina at home whos pretty sick of this shit but is too nice and trying to fix him instead of helping herself so everythings in her name so a couple of weeks go by i do my work impeccably every day and its time to get paid theres no money to pay me hes making excuses about how he didnt get some money the customer had promised like im too stupid to see where the money really went anyway i had nothing else to do so i worked another week listening to his promises that id be paid the next fridaythe end of weeks or work sure enough friday came and theres no money to pay mebut theres been blow every day for weeks now so i leave im not working for free and for revenge on getting weeks of work out of me for free i sent an anonymous letter to every utility he owed money to telling them where to find him he immediately had collectors on his doorstep filing summonses against him for thousands of dollars plus with me not doing any work the customers went from being impatient with how slowly work was being done to firing him for breach of contract good girl gina had enough and dumped him he had to leave town pretty much immediately he had no vehicle either so packed a bag and hitch hiked out of town last i heard he was in and out of rehab still a junkieabout years later and still going from town to town burning bridges and only concerned about his next high
when i was in fifth grade i was always getting picked on it was bad but there was this one kid he shall be named justin who was a demon i would draw trees in class after the lesson was over justin picked up on this and would take to calling me a tree fag he did stuff like this all the time during winter i would wear some cheap green gloves and i was dubbed booger fingers i didnt tell the proper authorities because that usually made it worse although i did become friends with the principal i tried to become friends with him and he would burp one of those horrible burps that smelled like trash juice in my face one day about a week till school was out for summer i had had enough i got one of those wood pencils sharpened it to a point and waited till we were on the way to the bus they had to dig about an inch of pencil lead from his back when the principal had made a show out of taking me to his office he got this look on his face like why and told me to next time punch him i was suspended the next day and no charges were made by the parents
to begin with english is not my first language so be prepared for some silly mistakes second some of my memories of this event is a bit hazy if there is any questions about how things were ill try to explain them the entire event took place in a month but my revenge happened over a weekend this was in the autum of i think i was born and my brother but since he had skipped a year in elementary school to be with his friends we were in the same age group altough we went to the same school we never were the same class it all began in highschool anyhow facebook had made its great entrance among minors so both of us had facebook accounts at that time i was a social recluse a anxious anime nerd who had a few friends and a perfect target for practical jokes which my brother knew thus i was faceraped for those of you who are unfamiliar with facerapes its when someone posts statuses on another persons account its often quite silly and obvious this was not much of a big deal i faceraped him back so to teach him a lesson but he didnt learn much from it as i found myself faceraped once again this was enough i thought time to end this silliness but only how thats when death note makes its appearance its an anime in great simplification about two people locked in a battle of wits as i watched it all became clear for me i now knew how i was going to get my revenge i was going to out wit him so greatly that he would not dare to mess with my facebook again the first step in the plan was to get access to my brothers facebook account so i was in need of his email and his password i got the perfect opportunity for this when we one friday were at our grandparents place he wanted to check his facebook on their computer so i simply axelsurfed his password easy his email would need some wit i asked him if he could help me install the email feature in my ipod after some arguing i got him to use his email to unlock it apparently my email didnt work now for the detailes i asked my brother for a good movie to download he happily adviced me to se the movie x and he also included the websites y where i could download it now i had everything i needed as soon as i were alone i logged into his facebook form my ipod good thing they had wifi there there i wrote something like this hello monsieur last name thank you for downloading movie x from website y i am now in full controll of your computer love from france this was not the actual message but i made some deliberate spelling and grammar mistakes to make the frenchman more realistic after i wrote this on my ipod i logged him out and logged into facebook with my own account i scrolled down to my own message made a poorly acted chuckle and showed it to my brother needles to say he was freaked out he instantly went onto the computer and deleted the message sadly the good thing was that he didnt change the password he decided that he would do that when we came home since i still could acces his account i kept my poor pokerface and let a half hour go by then i wrote something like this monsieur last name why would you remove my last message i just want to get along you really hurt my feelings do you really have to be this mean waited and showed him he got stressed and deleted the message and told our mom that we should go home asap two birds with one stone once at home my brother immediately changed the password which i had feared this was his great misstake the password he now had was quite strange so strange that he wrote it on a paper to remember it a paper i definatly could take a peek at my brother searched for viruses defragmented the computer and other stuff as well as he fiddled with his account i locked myself inside my room this was ordinary practice for me and my family allowed a teenager have that privacy in my room i could barely contain my excitement i wasted no time to create a fake frenchman the name of the man would obviously be jaquille theres not a single more french name then that i then checked for normal surnames i decided with dubois the third most normal surname in case my brother would search for this man then i looked for pictures of french men as usually i took several steps to make him more realistic meanwhile some of my brothers classmates had picked up what was happening to my brother and asked things like hey frenchy you there on my brothers profile i was quite close to dying in my attempts to not tell anyone who the frenchman really were later that night i snuck into my brothers room and got the password this was when the turd would hit the fan i changed his entire profile where jaquille lived where he went to school changed his profile picture and so on oh and jaquille was furious mr last name i have had enought of you do you really think that defragmenting searching for viruses and changing the password will stop me i am greatly insulted by you i only sought to be your friend and you treat me like this you really ought to be ashamed of yourself no love jaquille dubois i also replied to his classmates to their great joy forward to the morning and all hell broke loose my brother when compleatly nuts on his computer he changed admin the passwords to the profiles deleted all his movies anything to get rid of jaquille which i mocked him for publicly this went on the entire day he made somewhat desperat attempts to get rid of jaquille and got his attempts ridiculed publicly luckily he didnt try to change his password again i guess he thought jaquille would found it out anyway next day sunday was when the bubble would pop i had to pop it my brother had decided to reformat his computer he would lose everything on it i thought it would no longer be just about revenge then i revealed myself on my brothers account to everyones joy my family all burst out laughing when i exposed the truth even my brother was quite amused by it but the greatest thing was how i was received by my school on the monday people whom i didnt even know shouted encouraging things me which was quite of the contrast to my usual day in school the legacy of jaquille still lives on from that monday no one dared to mess with me and whenever my brother threatens to do something to me i calmly reminds him of the frenchman
im not sure if this belongs here or not but after having read some of these i think it does so in middle school i was a stereotypical nerd i was in the band did well in my classes etc unfortunately i had a bully as well the guy did all sorts of crap thankfully it never escalated to anything physical long story short he made my life hell for years on of his antics was constantly taking my pencils i knew they were mine and my teachers knew they were mine but we couldnt ever get proof so i decided to change that one day i wrote on a piece of paper this is gdawgs pencil i promptly folded it up and stuck it in the pencil i should note i use mechanical pencils anyway per usual he took it when i noticed i asked to see it he said no initially but for some reason eventually let me have it wrong move over his protests i took off the end of the pencil and pulled out the note and then handed it to the teacher he ended up in a fair amount of trouble once the school principal realized that the guy wasnt such an angel it felt great
for a while weve allowed posts that dont really involve revenge because wed like to be fairly hands off and let people up or downvote posts according to what they think of the revenge posts that dont include revenge do generate reports and complaints which we notice but the posts still get upvoted were open to changing whats allowed but wed like to know what people really think going off of the ratio of upvotes to comments it seems the silent majority is content with the nonrevenge posts and the vocal minority doesnt like them obviously the silent majority may not reply here but wed like to know what everyone thinks edit the mods have discussed this and well be moderating posts more strictly from now on to reflect the rules 
im not a fighter i never have been i had a close friend well call him black eye back in college who would fight every time he drank more often than not he would be picking fights with his closest friends including me im a happy drunk so im even less violent when having a jolly old time this story has little to do with him but thats the friend circle i was in one of them was a beast of a wrestler yet the nicest guy youd ever meet they were genuinely good friends but they were really just fun to party with on the good nights one day him his macho friends and i are at the neighbor girls party beer pong sorority chicks alpha males and me the party starts getting rowdy the cops come they id a few people but all is well in the world and they just make people leave no big deal our group walks two doors down to black eyes apartment three people from the party come as well were having fun playing drinking games and whatnot at one point i go to grab my galaxy s from the tv no phone i immediately have a mini heart attack and ask someone to call it i had just been using it the volume is all the way up everyone goes quiet no ring we all know exactly what happened macho friends and i run out the front door and continue calling i recall that one of the other guys went out back to call his gf we run around the apartment building before turning the corner black eye calls it again sure enough that boring generic samsung ringtone goes off behind his apartment thanks to the light we see it sitting in the grass feet from guy pretending to be on phone as in he literally had his phone up to his ear while the screen was showing the home page we call him out on it come on man free beer and you steal my phone he freezes up completely all he can say is what what he did not say another word he just kept freezing and asking what macho men starts getting in his face im not going to stop anything one more time he stutters and asks wha black eye punches him in the face it was so fast and i was intoxicated enough that i actually did not see the punch even though i was staring him in the face he doesnt move blood drips out of his mouth im still not a fighter and im not close with that circle anymore t was definitely mildy satisfying to see instant karma though wha he leaves we go inside one girl realizes her phone is missing too we call it and are happy to hear it ringing in a drawer she swears she didnt put it there why would she we ask the guys two friends to leave i fly home that weekend my old buddies told me that all those guys brought a few other guys to come kick their asses this time phone thieves and their buddies get beat you may be under the impression that its possible he didnt steal it he was the only person who had left the apartment there was only of us since i put my phone down minutes before it was him tldr someone steals my phone macho friend punches him guy tries to bring a possy a few nights later they all get beat i dont like violence but instant karma is a delight to witness
okay so im not sure if this is pro enough for you so if it isnt then feel free to tell me and i will put it under petty revenge okay this story starts off when i moved overseas to study in an international college i was staying in the schools hostel in my final year however due to my young age the room i was assigned was for really young students and delinquents this was so that the corridor could be watched over by supervisors now i was the only young person there everyone else in my sector were delinquents and unfortunately it turns out they pulled some strings so a of them were close friends that chose rooms beside each other they were the worst fucking neighbours i ever had every other night meant wall rumbling and sex noises my table would shake and the paper thin plaster walls did not hide anything my neighbour wanted to do without fail every am i would be disturbed by drunken laughter or angry screams walking back to my room wasnt easy either they were big older russians about years older students that were there to literally flunk classes every day was a new adventure be it dirty piles of laundry left outside their room to navigate through spilt bottles of alcohol that seeped into my room loud drunk people banging on random doors and walls and picking fights with cleaners or even broken chairs and lights left in the corridor to be cleaned up now all this i figured i could live through it wasnt a big deal for me exams were pretty far away and i wore plugs to deal with the noise this all changed in the last few months of my stay there one day i hear the usual laughter and shouting in the room beside me after a while i hear a knock on my door opening it it seems that the door was rigged so that upon opening it a bottle of piss would tip over and drain into my room cue fast hands and panic as i desperately grabbed the bottle and stopped about half of it from spilling i spend the next mins cleaning myself and hands but the piss smell was terrible it seemed that this prank was planned for a long time because the concoction was painful to breathe in after cleaning my hands off i took the half empty piss bottle cleaned and capped it and set it on my table it was at that moment when my room was smelly as fuck and i knew the it would be so for the next few days until the cleaners came to clean my room it was then did i decide i had enough of his shit so i kept the bottle left it on my table as a constant reminder to the pain i suffered that day the smell sealed inside i began gathering everything i could think of to create the worst revenge imaginable first off was a trip to my friends room my friend was a pretty messy guy and often had all sorts of moldy crap inside his room one of those such things was a mixing bottle the bottle was intended for fresh juice to be squeezed into it but my friend hadnt bothered to take a week old lemon out from the jar causing it to fester i took that next i went online and searched for as many stink i bought some basic stink bombs at first then lady revenge saw my plight and a few weeks later i had found out my friend had purchased butyric acid for shits and giggles online i took that from him too now i didnt want to mix this up too early or my own room would stink unfortunately me waiting too long ruined a part of my revenge of the people that were together of them had left or moved out of the hostel thus only one was left and he was to be the sole victim of my hatred so the time came and i mixed it all up a few weeks before he and i were to leave we had the same supervisor and i was really friendly with her while he was not leaving it in my toilet which had a really powerful airvent i let it sit for a few days and all this time i had kept the bottle of piss with me half empty on my table it would be the last piece of my plan now came plan b i was afraid that i might not have time or would chicken out from the main quest and since i had spare stink bombs that i hadnt used in the final product i decided to go through with plan b anyway spying on him i learnt of the times he would leave his laundry in the laundry room or go to dinner i took the extra stink bombs and for three simultaneous washes i dropped them in with his washing i like to think that his clothes were fucked from three washes and dry spins i would never know so back to the concoction finally after whole days of festering i poured it into the bottle making my own modifications to the bottle i chopped off the top to allow the entire thing to spill immediately i poured and stirred god the smell was horrifyingbut so beautiful as i stared at the bottle i knew the time was right he would be stuck in that room for the next few days and there wouldnt be cleaners around as the holidays were about to begin ironically a few days before the supervisor came to wish me goodbye in advance as she was leaving first and asked me whether my neighbour was a nice neighbour as she also knew he was a delinquent i had told her i had no problem with him and so we left on good terms as a final i would say cherry on top i peed a bit into the bottle as my mark of revenge back to the revenge i placed it at his door but with my own mix i attached the bottle to a piece of string which i strapped to his doorknob upon opening the string would drag the bottle over tipping the entire thing into the room i did my work when i tracked him to be inside the room after his dinner and banged on the door furiously to get him worked up enough to swing open the door as fast as possible it went better than expected after hiding i heard a loud scream before a slam a sound of the door opening again and then a louder scream i could hear him charge around shouting something in russian before going back to his room success as i approached my room once again the smell hit me lucky for me i was ready a few days before i had borrowed a large fan to be placed in my room from another friend summer hits hard with no ac and so the smell didnt waft into my room for long i could see the large stain left all over the floor laughing to myself i went to my room and rested now fast forward a few days later eventually the guy did everything with his room door open to allow the smell out walking past the large stain left behind showed me the damage done the spill had effectively flown inwards fortunately for me and gotten over a whole bundle of his clothes i believe he was packingwhich he dumped at the foot of his door i would see him walking around looking pissed as hell sometimes if i sat close to him in the canteen i could still smell the stank permeating from his skin i guess he wasnt that well of a scrubber i spilt about ml of stinky ass liquid into his room ml of it was his own piss and very little of mine he stayed in that room for another weeks before all of us parted ways my final glee was at the end of everything he came up to me as i was leaving asking to speak with me in broken english he asked if i saw anyone throw the bottle of piss into his room i shrugged my shoulders and feigned ignorance as i loaded my luggage onto the bus i saw him walking to the canteen so i screamed as the bus passed by the hostel and left to the airport thanks for the bottle of piss i left it at your door i hoped that was enough for him to understand what it meant i like to think it was though probably not since english wasnt his first language tldr russian neighbour makes my life a living hell and the final straw is spilling piss all over me and my room i take what he gave me and threw it back with mine and a bit more
i didnt do this but one of my guy friends did when i was in high school we had this handicap kid in a wheel chair who thought that just because he was in a wheel chair you couldnt touch him he was always in trouble for sexual harassment and shit like that he even propositioned me once in a very disgusting way to which i replied oh hun youd fall in love and id fall asleep he got so mad but didnt try anything else probably because it was common knowledge that if you screwed with me my brothers would find you well i told one of my guy friends about what he said and he was upset he told some of his guy friends and so on and so forth until they had a group of people who were tired of this kids shit he harassed their girlfriends andor femalefriends and talked shit and despite his many many write ups for sexual harassment the school refused to do anything besides send him to sensitivity training i guess my complaint was just the straw that broke the camels back because the next thing i know theyve done something about him now i have to explain one thing to you our school had a grand staircase which was basically a huge stair case with a landing in the middle and steps on either side of the landing so these guys my friend included corner him in between classes pick him and his wheel chair up put him on this landing and left him he was there for over an hour i think but it im not sure he was there inbetween class changes and not a single person did anything to help him not one a school of over students who use that staircase as their main mod to get from first to second floor and not one person did a damn thing i even walked passed him and laughed then walked away he had to wait until a teacher found him and got other teachers to help get him on solid ground my friends never got in trouble for it im not sure why i think it was because he couldnt really identify them by name after that anytime he tried shit all you had to do was say staircase and hed go white and shit himself edit when i say sexual harassment i mean he was notorious for not only making the most disgusting comments but grabbing girls butts breast and groins yes groin slapping their asses lifting their skirts and shirt i mean the foulest stuff that would have gotten you kicked out but because the school didnt want anyone to get butthurt they didnt
story starts in or i was in hs and was going with some close girlfriends to a very close guy friends house for new years needless to say lots of drinks and for a lb hs kid a whole bottle of jack put me out my then very close male friend ryan told me i could pass out in his room all was good as ryan had always been straight with me or so i thought so i went into his room alone and closed the door i was enveloped with quiet and darkness the perfect mix to sleep off the over consumption of alcohol skip ahead an undetermined amount of hours i start come around to the sound of our mutual friend cory yelling through the door dude dont do this you know this is fucked up just stop you know its wrong i look up to see what i thought was a close friend ryan i freaked and pushed him off i tried to pretend it never happened like i do all my problems a few weeks later i find out that ryan really liked me and it wasnt just taking advantage of a drunk girl thing for him that is when i got my plan for revenge however i never would have thought it would be so great ryan actually had the nerve to ask me out i said yes i went out with him i laughed at his jokes my friends wondered wtf i was doing i never told any of them that it was all in my plan one day i heard from corys girlfriend who was my best friend that ryan had told him he was in love with me that was my que the next night me and ryan had plans to go out and i had my ultimate revenge ready ryan shows up to go out i say nothing as i get into the car in the pause he starts crying and says his mom just found out she has months to live that her cancer was far more advanced then they thought i think to myself no fucking way this could play out any better so i look him in the face with no emotion and tell him i never even liked you were done i figured this would cause at most some minor hs heartbreak and several months of pain it wasnt until yrs later that i seen how deep i had cut him we ended up working at the same place and i came to find out he married a girl that looks like me talks like me and has my same name normally the name thing wouldnt be a big deal if i had a name like amanda or brittney but i have a ver unusual name found out when he got drunk at the company xmas party that he is still in love with me i hope he wallows around in it until he dies fuck him
this didnt happen to me but i think the story is too perfect to not share at school i lived in an apartment thats been passed down in our fraternity so we all know each other and have stories shared from the past well a few years ago one of the roommates was notorious for leaving his dishes in the sink and never doing dishes not a guy my older roommates hated and wanted out just an annoying thing he did well one day they had enough of the shit it was a person apartment the other bought paper plates utensils bowls everything and decided to only use those disposable ones they didnt let the th roommate know about this well after a couple weeks the sink started getting really filled roommate came into the living room one day while they were watching tv and said something along the lines of man the sink is really getting filled someone should do the dishes at which point they made the big reveal that the dishes all could only be his he was pissed for a short bit but it got the point across and its a great story now
disclaimer this is not my revenge and isnt as good as the last one story this is the same guy as my other post he is a landscaper and he doesnt like not getting paid he did some work for a lawyer i think it was around two or three weeks of work and the lawyer was very pleased and got lots of compliments from his neighbors it was the talk of the street at the time however the lawyer didnt pay up revenge like i have mentioned the landscaper doesnt like not getting paid he decided to make a point and show the lawyer up he parked and old caravan on the guys lawn with a sign saying pay me when the lawyer asked what was going on he said me and my family wont be able to pay the mortgage because you wont pay me we are just going to live here with you lets just say he got paid the next day
about a month ago my bike got stolen with lock and all the moment when i walked out of the library i knew there was something wrong because i didnt see any in the neigbourhood that even remotly looked like a mountain bike as i was panicking my burger started to fall out of my mouth because of the sheer suprise that someone would steal a bike with locks on it in the middle of the city where everyone can see i asked one of the security gaurd that worked near the place of the crime if he has seen someone stealing a mountainbike his answer was something in the lines of this the chance that you will get your bike back is small due to the fact that people steal bikes with locks and just puts in a truck and sells it poland or something except the fact that guy had a bias view on polish people he seemed like a straight up guy that wouldnt be bullshitting me i proceed to walks home instead of pressing charges in defeat pondering if i should be an asshole and steal one for myself didnt do it didnt want to that jackass a month passes by and its my birthday so the th of december in the evening i went to watch the premiere of the last hobbit movie which in my opinion was way better than the other two as were walking from the movie my friend and i roll a spliff and start smoking as were walking home as we turn around the corner into a street thats usually calm eventhough its next to a street that has like bars in the corner of my eyes i can see a shape that looks quite familiar i check it out and there it is my bike in its grace amp glory i recognized it imiidiatly cause i had this bike for over years now and it was quite an expensive and sturdy mountain bike that you dont see that often in my city plus it had the kinks scratches and dent that i was responsible for through the years as i inspect further i can see that the thief put on a new light a new seat and he got new brakes very nice as i notify my friend we both agree to smoke the jay first and call the cops after but we had one issue the bike was locked and i didnt have proof that it was mine cause you see i got it as a gift from my neigbour and my neigbour got it from a friend of his the neigbour never used it due to the fact that he already had a bike and it wouldve been quite helpful if the the orginal owner was still alive and if you dont have proof that the bike is yours then you dont have shit to show to the police as i start panicking my proceeds to call the police to notify them about the situation they will reply with that they will be there withing min since its not a urgernt matter my friend then calls up his dad who is in a very high position within the police force he tells him the story and tells him exactly what to do in this situation i dont know what the fuck is going on but he looks quite happy and he doesnt tell me shit except that everything will be fine the police came on time and we tell them the situation the police couldnt do much since i didnt have proof that it was eventhough they did believe because of how precise i was with mentioning the kinks and dents in the bike and that i knew everything about the bike model and showed them where i scratched my name in years ago but since i didnt press charges they couldnt do much then my friends smile and proceed to tell them this what if we can kill two birds with one stone what if we can proof that the person who locked this bike is not the owner and what if can catch the person at the same time in one swoop all you have to do is put a lock on the bike and wait for the person to come and as he is coming to pick up the bike which should be between so around the time we were talking and when all the bars are closing he will be stunned and suprised and then you guys will come around the corner and so will we and start questioning him about it and since he cant proof it to you guys he must have either stolen the bike or bought it from a thiefwhich is also punishable thought our law the two police officers were quite skepitcal with the plan until my friends proceed to call his dad through skype and give the phone to them my friends dad shows proof of who he is and that he agrees with the plan and takes full resposibility for anythings that will happen after this call both officer agree on his term and then one of them tells them that i should press charges online rightn now throug my phone with the frame number of the bike so that i can use it as proof that it ws mine as we set everything up the moment of truth happens around a scrawny looking guy comes around the corner wearing a hoodyjeans and some nike air max as he is walking up to the bike he stops midway and then runs to the bike he is checking it and then starts screaming and swearing in polish had polish friends who were my high school buddies and we used to play a lot of online shooters on east europe servers where they swear in russian and polish so you pick some shit up so the suka keeps screaming and that was the que for the police officer to come around the corner and have a talk with this guy the guy sees the cops and is frozen on the spot i proceed to walk around the corner with my friend and we walk towards the guy until were infront of him the police officer ask him what the issue is and why hes screaming he proceed to tell the officer that someone locked his bike the officer looks at him and smiles then points at me and tells him thats funny cause this guy just told me his bike got stolen and that this bike looks exactly the same as his the guy got caught when he couldnt show the cops any proof that the bike was his the agony in his face was beautiful on the spot i remembered that i had i had some pictures with my bike that i made in the past and that you could also see the exact same dent with it in it the cops were convinced now they proceed to get the bolt cutter from their car and cut the lock like it was nothing before i go away i walk up to the car and look at the guy and tell him thanks for the fix bro i dont have to pay for jack shit anymore the police officers thanked us and to call them if we ever have another crazy adventure like this i say goodbye to my friend and to tell his dad that i will send him a gift as i get back on my bike i proceed to like an idiot while singing i fought the law and i won and the people is how my birthday miracle happend edit i think some people are confused or just sceptical about this story let me explain some little things so you might understand the situation better i live in holland in holland we use a lot more bikes than cars so that means the rate of bike theft is also very high so high even that there is a suprise check on the road just for bikes to see if theyre stolen or that your bike is still functioning fine you actually get a fine for having nobroken lights or if your break doesnt work well so that means we also have seperate laws just for bikes so do understand some things are easier here when it comes to bikes but some things are also harder because of the laws so before anyone starts rambling about this story making no sense try to imagine that you live in a country where the people actually care about bike owners
i didnt do what happened in these stories i was too timid at the time to have the balls to do these but my badass sister and my boyfriend did a couple of years ago i dated an asshole ah who was physically and verbally abusive after making me a shell of myself stealing my debit card putting me in debt and killing my credit he slept with our married coworker and left me to be one of her several fuck buddies a few months after we broke up he came crawling back to me to be friends ie using me for rides and money being the idiot i was i let him right back into my life after a month of watching his abusive and controlling behavior my sister had enough one night while he was showing he still could control me his exact words made me stay outside my sisters house in freezing weather to cry to me about his latest failed conquest she watched my attempts to try to go inside just to get a jacket only to see him yank me down to the stairs she grabbed a large beer mug and called together everyone in the house and got them all to piss in it she calmly went outside mug in hand and walked over to us telling me it was a frosty beer walking right up to ah sitting on the wall she motioned me to stand next to her which i did the next moment that beer was all over him after marinating in it for a moment the heat and smell being a dead giveaway he realized what was on him he screamed and ran off into the night to this day if my sister sees him shell sniff then ask what reeks of piss the other story also involves ah but this time my current boyfriend bf is the one dishing it out bf and i share a love of wrestling so we were planning on joining some friends at a hooters a few towns over to watch the latest payperview ah seeing this as an opportunity to get money out of me see scantily clad women and maybe flirt with someone decided to tag along right off the bat he was being a fuckball refusing to chip in for gas he agreed to get a different ride home and pay them making us drive all over creation for him making us wait outside his house for a half hour then punching bfs window telling us to behave we were discussing the nights matches while i painted my nails the ride up he mostly behaved aside from a few crude comments but the second we sat down he was hellbent on making us as miserable as possible my friends had tables one had extra seats the other only had one so to me the seating arrangement was obvious but not to asshole as bf and i went to sit at the spots asshole began to complain and whine until someone gave him a seat closer to us ah began ordering several expensive drinks and foods while bf and i spilt an order of fries and each had a soda relevant i swear while watching the ppv bf would occasionally hug me or give me a quick peck which apparently pissed ah off so he tried to drag me next to him by my tounge bf wasnt having it so he pulled me back to my seat keeping his arm around me ah reacted by storming out of the restaurant catching up to him he threatened to beat my ass if i came near him so i went back inside and enjoyed the rest of the ppv after it ended ah came back insulted his ride home then came up to bf and i telling us we were going to pay his bill over take him wherever we were planning to go then bring him home for free i get ready to tell him off when bf puts his hand on my shoulder and tells him well take care of everything but he should go use the bathroom because itll be a long drive ah agrees and says at least one of us has a brain scuttling away im about to tell bf off when he tosses my coat at me and drags me out to the car minutes later my phone starts blowing up but its ignored i later found out ah began begging everyone a free ride home saying id promised him the night was on me nope so he didnt bring his wallet another lie he was forced to pay his bill with tip then pay my friend for a ride home
this is a long story i am leaving out of the drama cuz it would take up too much space its about my second husband and how i went from deleriously happy to completely demoralized in less than two years and how i paid him back we met at work and i thought we had a fun and friendly work relationship thats what i thought until the day i gave notice to quit after that he seemed upset and when he called me from work on mothers day i found out why he told me about his year loveless and hateful marriage and he told me he loved me my first thought was wtf a married guy from work tells me he loves me but after years alone it was nice to know i could still find someone to love me as my last week at work wound down we started to meet for lunch dinner after work hot makeout sessions in the car i was determined to not have actual sex with him because i had always had a rule against dating married men but the passion was just too hot the urges too strong the whispers of love too enthralling to stop at just kissing once the deed was done there was no going back the sex was just too good too primal and so so so very orgasmic i just couldnt wait to have him for my own after a couple of months we moved in together it was like a fairytale i was his princess he took such good care of me he doted on me he did everything for me we had sex every day two three up to five times a day and i thought i was in heaven there was drama with his ex but he loved me and we could get past it i was in love i was blind to his faults but that changed eventually he started to get jealous over any interaction i had with men coworkers clients men i walked past in the grocery store it started to go horribly wrong we eventually moved into his former marital home and it went beyond horrible he started to slap me around the emotional abuse and accusations increased to an every day occurrence i had a feeling he was cheating there were clues but he told me i was crazy and imagining things i quantified it in my demoralized mind because he loved me then i knew he was cheating i went to his softball game in disguise and saw him with her i finally knew i had to leave i left him and did not tell him where i got another job and did not tell him where this was in the days before cell phones so i didnt give him my new phone numbers but we had some friends in common and he begged them to tell me he stillloved me that he was done with her and that he wanted me back i know i was stupid but he loved me and i agreed to see him the heat was still there hot as hades and i moved back in with him i quit the crappy job i hated and it was going to be fine and it was for the weekend but he told me i had to go he was wrong and he wanted to be with her so i eventually found a new place to live found a new job and i was going to move forward with my life wrong the same scenario was repeated not once not twice but or times always ending the same way him persuing me until i went back to him him telling me to leave the last time i went back he asked me to marry him and fool that i was i said yes because he loved me it was not a marriage made in heaven he was still seeing her he was still being emotionally abusive he still slapped me around and accused me of cheating on him because i was minutes late getting home from work and i was chewing gum to cover up the smell of cum on my breath yes the cheating bastard actually said that even though i had never even thought about cheating on him but i guess thats what the pot does to convince himself that the kettle is black the marriage lasted for weeks i left and moved in with family he knew them so he knew where i was this time i was strong he would call and leave messages for me and i wouldnt call back he wanted to see me but i refused he eventually filed for divorce i did not contest it the divorce was scheduled for final dissolution on a monday and he called me on the friday before he started to leave a message that went something like this him hi baby i guess you know court is scheduled for monday but i really miss you and i still love you and maybe we can work things out if you want to give it another try theres still time to cancel the divorce so if you think we can make it give me a call back i pick up the phone then but i dont stop the record function on the answering machine and i get our entire minute phone conversation on tape during this conversation i play along letting him know i still love him too he tells me he is totally done with her that he was only with her because he was so screwed up about us and he didnt want to be alone if he couldnt be with me blahdiddy blah blah blah same old crap he had been feeding me for the last year but the things he was saying about her were things she needed to hear and by this time i was so over the bastard i wanted the divorce to be absolutely and undeniably final so i keep him talking knowing full well that her is going to be arriving home from work soon when he starts trying to end the call i do everything i can to keep him talking asking if her is going to be home soon and he says f her i dont give a s about her but i gotta go now and i will call you sunday click so i take that tape and make copies over the past months i had been doing some detective work using his phone bills i was able to get the addresses of her brother exhusband and parents i sent copies of the tape to all of them with a note telling them to make sure her listens to it i also sent a copy to her at his address i sent them on saturday overnight express but i did not know that the post office delivers overnight packages on sunday so my plan to get the tapes delivered on monday after court failed i also delivered a copy of the tape to his attorneys office who threatened me for illegally taping a phone conversation to which i responded that he had to know it might be recorded because he started to leave a message and i forgot to stop the tape that shut the attorney right up so on sunday the day before the divorce was supposed to be final i get the final message he is pissed screaming the foulest descriptions of females that anyone has ever heard he sounds like hes foaming at the mouth he threatens revenge he screams that the divorce will be final and he is done with me he went on for at least minutes and i am sure her was there listening to his final rant against me i wish i could have been there when her listened to the tape and knowing that he might have intercepted the tape i sent to his house is why i sent tapes to her relatives i wanted to make sure she heard what he said about her only she was just as stupid as i was and ended up married to him but it still wasnt over he started leaving love notes on my car he sent me roses on my birthday i sent the notes and roses back to her and told her to get her man some professional help cuz he was just plain crazy so i wished for a man who would love me and have sex as often as i wanted i got a man wholoved me and had sex more often than any woman needed but i should have known that a cheater will always be a cheater and it was my big big bad for breaking my rule about never dating married men never happened again i did hear later that they were still married and that he was still cheating on her better her than me edit for clarity although he was still legally married they were living apart ex was living with her boyfriend and there were custody and property issues that delayed the final divorce decree so even though tbey were still legally married i was not the cause of the breakup but it is not a wise choice to be with someone until the final papers are signed
a few years ago i was going to aampp school for hours a night after working a hour day all week i hated being there along with everyone else that was there we had this huge fucking doucher named bobby as a classmate hed done time for theft drove a bmw that mom and dad had bought for him disappeared so often that our instuctor made it a weekly assignment for someone to keep tabs on him and make sure he wasnt stealing something or fucking shit up everytime he got in trouble for some stupid shit he did hed try to blame the instructors like they had it out for him personally everyone and i mean everyone hated the idiot he made all our lives even more depressing than it already was on our smoke breaks hed smoke half a cigarette knock the cherry off and set it in a little groove on a sort of retaining wall then go back inside he would always come back out at the next break and finish it for months nights a week i would pick up his leftover cigarette butt stick it in my pants rub the filter on my asshole as if chalking a pool stick place it back on into the groove and then watch him smoke it at the next break it happend so much that eventually everyone in my class including the instructor knew i was doing it and no one ever said a fucking word 
the more detailed backstory is i tried to get some ideas here revilbrainstorming but that sub sucks by the way unlike rprorevenge in my work we have a few people who are true characters unfortunately one of them is not so fun a coworker an obese version of don literally whom we call jon don because of his name wasnt cleaning the toilet after himself for months i and couple other guys tried to talk to him but nothing worked moreover his trips to the ditch were making unable to use the toilet for any other men for the next minutes due to poor ventilation and poisoning gasses which were just hanging in the air i found somewhere on prorevenge about capsaicin i tested it out and decided to use it i told all the guys to be careful with the toilet and actually i got the support of my actions since no legal way was possible and talking to jon don didnt do a thing first i sprayed the toilet sitting with the capsaicin solution didnt to a thing but i didnt think about the paper everyone uses to put on the sitting first my second try required little more research and more time to make it work since im a patient person all the time i was delighted with the thoughts of upcoming prorevenge im always on time at work unlike jon don which gave me the advantage in form of my research and not being spotted on my plans one day i went to the restroom and marked the toilet paper every blisters and rolled it back all the guys knew to dont use the toilet which jon don was always using after jon dons finished throwing with mud on the porcelain and a significant amount of time has passed i went to measure how much paper does don jon use for the safety reasons i repeated this procedure on another day the rd step was simple since i had all my data necessary i measured the amount of the paper he uses and i sprayed the capsaicin solution while i was rolling the toilet paper back letting it to dry a little very important here is the message i left i wrote on a sticky note polite information which i placed little after jon don would already wiped his butt with capsaicinated paper so he didnt see the message before he rubbed the capsaicin on the message said jon don i ask you to start cleaning after yourself and to not make the toilet to smell like a shithell this is the last warning the next step will be letting to know all the female employees about the situation which as you know was the secret among males your coworker or something like that i made sure with an american coworker that there are no grammar mistakes so the note wouldnt point directly to me since im the only male in the company whos english is a second language and since jon don knew my writing i made sure its unrecognizable to be sure everything will work like planned i made fresh coffee after the lunch which i knew jon don will consume to soon after hit the gym every male employee knew whats about to happen we all were waiting in anticipation for jon don very curious of the outcome hoping to teach jon don a lesson which his mom definitely forgot to do he walked our sweating and walking funny and very fast he couldnt sit longer than seconds at his desk and suddenly walked out from the office he didnt show up back that day he also didnt call the boss that hes leaving but we made sure that he wont get in trouble covering for him the toilet has been squeaky clean from the moment the message was delivered i can also tell jon don spends much less time sitting on the toilet we still wait after hes done just to be safe all the guys promised to forget about the revenge and to never talk again about it im sure jon don will remember the lesson so what really happened with the solution and jon dons ass the solution itself has no color and no scent but it burns the hell out of every part of skin you put it on i accidentally touched my face after testing even i washed my hands very carefully with a lot of dish washing soap and it still burned my face i cant imagine the agony and the burning sensation after rubbing it on your anus until this day i have no idea what happened to jon don after he received the message the next day everything was back to normal besides the toilet has been clean tldr a coworker didnt want to start cleaning after himself and one day his ass gets on fire

when i was in the th grade i went to a house party with a few of my friends this was back when the hot game console was the ps relevant later when we walked in the kid that lived in the house and a couple of his friends were sitting there manhandling this really wasted girl like putting their hands down her pants and sniffing each others fingers and shit we broke up the fondle party and took her home she begged us not to report the incident im not totally sure about her reasons with it being a tiny town and the perpetrator being a football star and the popular guy in school she claimed that there would be some sort of backlash that sucks but we respected her wishes fast forward to several weeks later to the scene of a huge house party at the same place he had a brand new ps and we each took turns slipping into the party when everyone was passing out and we pissed all inside the disc tray and down into the inside of the console to where you could shake it and would slosh another friend of mine that had no piss on deck pinched a giant loaf into one of his dresser drawers another one of us went in mr rapists mom and dads bedroom lifted up the blankets stuck his finger down his throat and vomited a crave case of white castle sliders onto their bed and then neatly made the bed back im sure when they returned from their church convention four days later it smelled pretty nice in that room his methodist pastor father grounded him for all eternity he was never prosecuted for the crime but last i saw him mr curious hands now in his mid s had six or seven small children and was in line at the local pawn shop trying to pawn a stolen tv for some meth its a small midwestern town if you take a shit everyone knows edit i know this story is real for me to try too hard to convince every skeptic would be pointless
background me f and my sister have never gotten along she has always had it out for me for as long as i can remember i have two younger siblings f and m who she tolerates and for the most part gets along with for example she used to yell at me for going in the car with my mom to pick her up from places when she was in middle schoolhigh school on vacations with my cousins we all slept in the same bed and she would pinch me to the point of tears and whisper cruel things to me she was around when i was about she threw scissors at me for being on the computer and not getting off when she wantedi could go on forever but these are a few of the more minor things shes done she has no remorse and cares only about herself and things that will benefit her regardless of who she hurts she is extremely territorial as well after doing a bit of growing up i thought we were past this and able to tolerate each other but tonight proved otherwise i got a text from my younger sister telling me that my older sister was yelling and screaming that i had taken things from her room while she was away for the night i raced home knowing what she is capable of in this type of mood to find her screaming you know what you did f you etc she couldnt tell me exactly what i took from her but she knew something was missing i yelled back a bit and shrugged it off until i walked into my room to find the clothes are minor but the puppy holds a lot of sentimental valuei picked up one of the legs off of my floor and fell to the floor in tearsive had him for years and fallen asleep with him in my arms every night she knew how much this would hurt me in third grade i went to work with my father for the day after work he took me over to his friends restaurant in the seaport and we hung out there for a bit i remember him giving me a little bit of money and his friends girlfriend now wife took me into the south street seaport mall where i picked out the cutest softest stuffed animal i could find we went back into the restaurant and started brainstorming names we finally decided on jereca a combination of my name her name and the waitresses name who i always thought was the coolest girl from then on jereca pretty much became my best friend in a way he always provided me with comfort so when i walked in to see her do that over something that she was imagining killed me i dont know what to do with myselfim hurt angry and sad about this whole situation any questions comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated psthe skirt is by the brand splendid i bought it last year for a great price at loehmanns but i cant seem to find it online anywhereanyone know a place that would have it update so my parents said they had this long talk with her she will replace what she damaged and that i need to let it go this type of behavior from her is not uncommon and has been occurring since i was young i threatened a police report and got yelled at i asked for money to install deadbolts on my closet doors and i was told to knock it off i really dont understand what goes through my parents heads but my sister is not mentally stable
be warned this is a very long story i have shortened it and left out some details so any clarifications please ask what occurred happened over the course of a year ampnbsp my mum is a very sweet lady divorced years old still works full time trusting of everybody she still lives in my family home and rents out a room to help with the bills and the company its a fairly large house we have had a string of lodgers live in the house over the years but this one was nothing like we ever expected enter james a wellpresented wellspoken man who worked in executive recruitment years old thinning on top a golden handshake and an air of superiority he came telling tales of divorce and looking for somewhere to live that felt like a family home and not a hotel room strange but he sold the story to my mums he has id he has business cards backing up his claim of employment he seems like an ideal lodger ampnbsp things go normally for half a year he seems like a nice guy he is constantly telling us that he works for a recruitment company and is waiting on delivery of a jaguar company car this was the first red flag he regales us with stories of his past and tells my mum he was in the army in his younger years specifically the parachute regiment after a while he begins to make romantic moves with my mum and spending more and more time together he takes a copy of my cv and offers to help me find better employment either at his company or at one of his clients even going so far as to arrange meeting with me to help me with my interview techniques he pays his rent on time often with a little extra for my mum keeps saying he will be moving back out into his own property soon ampnbsp this is where things start to fall apart it is now months and the jaguar has never arrived he has an excuse for everything job interviews i am lined up for mysteriously start being cancelled he is now romantically involved with my mother i get a little suspicious but my suspicions are cooled when i am involved in a way phone conversation with himself and a client as a primary job interview for an incredibly prestigious job which i am afterwards told went very well and i would have a sit down shortly he even starts offering to buy my mother and myself new cars he arrives with brochures and books test drives for various cars it was fun but it just didnt sit well with me i should not have done it but i had a quick search of his room and found ids with two different names and paperwork in a black back pack that suggested he had been arrested before i immediately tried to explain the situation to my mum who dismissed it without reason rose tinted glasses and an almighty argument starts i leave the house covering all my tracks i never found out who the client was on the phone ampnbsp a week later i get a phone call from a recruitment firm asking me who i am and why i was in their system it turns out that tony was a recruiter who had setup a side business with an existing recruitment agency to provide high end recruitment the owner business partner was impressed with his credentials but so far he had failed to deliver on just about everything and started missing days in the office because of this they had gone through his email and found one from me when i sent him my cv at first they suspected me of being a client he was dealing with off the books but it later turned out everything he had promised the company had been a lie he was claiming commission for placing staff at companies that either never show up or didnt exist at all a hour phone call with the ceo of this company was enough to prove all my suspicions this guy was either a pathological liar or a conman ampnbsp it took a very long conversation with my mum followed by an argument and then another conversation to get her to see sense it was only then that she shared more details i had previously not known he had been enquiring about her will more and more and the value of the house promised her holidays that never surfaced and his behaviour was becoming stranger and stranger it was at first a bit embarrassing so many redflags we had both either not seen or ignored but with the rose tinted glasses firmly taken off it was all so clear my mum had just returned from having a meal with tony before i had a sit down with her our plan was to search his room find evidence and either go to the police or wait for him to return the first thing i did was try and locate his backpack along with the ids but it was gone everything else was still in the room but that bag i had a sinking feeling that he had already guessed the game was up i was being far too aggressive with my quest for information and had some how tipped him off we waited for him to return ampnbsp he never returned he had realised the game was up im not sure how but just like that he was gone my mum was heart broken i was stressed we realised a lot of the things he had promised had been lies it hurt i had taken days off work for job interviews that never transpired my mum had started to work less and less under promises that she would be financially supported by him i needed my revenge i needed to make him pay for hurting my family hurting me hurting my mum we can only speculate what his end plan was we suspect he was after the house but shes incredibly healthy by normal standards let alone a year old woman god knows what he had planned to do ampnbsp i didnt sleep that night the first thing i did was change the locks and get a close friend to watch the house i then told the people next door what had happened and asked them to keep an eye out i then logged a complaint with the police via a friend in the force and set to work ampnbsp the first piece of revenge take every possession he had and donate it to the local homeless shelter the sharp suits shoes unworn and still in boxes his tie collection class rings jewellery all given to the homeless it took trips in my truck to move them but we did it i hope we had some very well dressed homeless people that year i hope the suits helped them with job interviews i then called his now ex business partner boss and confirmed what had happened the two of us set to work contacting every recruitment company in the area with a copy of his photo names and a brief explanation that he was not to be trusted we also went through a list of his previous employers customers many of them confirmed similar strange goings on and agreed to spread the word i then contacted a friend who actually was in the parachute regiment they can find no record of his existence he claimed he saw combat in one particular war which would have made him eligible for a certain medal or commendation no record is found of this the army take a dim view of people falsifying service ampnbsp so we had taken his job and all the possessions he had except the clothes on his back and his car god i wanted that car i wanted to crush it next was to remove his support network we tried to trace his family eventually finding the name and number of his exwife we called her she was a lovely woman who confirmed what we thought it was not the first time suspicious goings on had happened but it was certainly the worst it had been she had left him over his escalating behaviour she suspects the behaviour to be from a break down of some kind tells us he used to be very successful but lost his job and it set him on a downward spiral she talks to their children who immediately wash their hands of him she confirms his lack of military service and fills in a lot of blanks for us i had taken from him his home his job his carrier his clothes and now his family the police now had a report and where looking for him too and my friend in the parachute regiment told me not to worry about whatever they were doing about it just to know they knew about it ampnbsp i spent a week touring the homeless shelters hospitals and hotels looking for him i drove over miles at night looking for his car we will never know where he went but i never found him or his car his family have since had contact and his youngest son knows where he is they assure me he checked into a facility and is receiving help im not convinced but im not going to shake a teenage boy down for the location of him his name and face is seared into my mind and i want nothing more than to take from him his heath but even i have a limit but one day i will come across him again i dont know what i will do then ampnbsp post script this occurred over the course of a year there are a lot of details i had to miss out to keep this short enough to post on the face of it all involved look very naive for falling for it but that is how conmen perform their art they become part of your life work your way in there is a supporting cast behind this that helped me with my revenge and i will never forget their help i wish i could finish the story with an epic final show down a beating and a trip to the hospital jail but sadly real life doesnt always go that way i took as much as i could from him and i hope i stopped him doing it again i believe he may well have done something to my mum once he got into the will thank you for reading my story ampnbsp edit someone pointed out i called him james and then tony james was the name he gave us his real name turned out to be tony we called him james for entire time we knew him since then i have got into the habit of referring to him as tony

this is a long one ill make a line below to let you know when the revenge starts the rest is just back story and justification i worked as a contractor under a security company for this one business i was underneath my supervisor super from here on out i was young when i first started working there it was my first time actually working in a corporate environment for any real length of time i had no idea how the politics worked the pecking order and how much like highschool it reminded me super had trained me for that site i had really just worked with the company to find out what roles needed to be filled and done by security and i wrote the book for dayshift for that site i had trained every guard that came through that site super got the credit of course super also made mistakes and didnt care about the job since i dont want to be here all day ill just list if if youd like an explanation just ask down below screwing up mail and blaming it on me sleeping on the job and blaming the missed work on retraining me telling the employees of my mistakes and personal life taking the credit of any work that i did that he could not hearing an exchange between an employee and myself which would have saved me from a write up this one was the last straw by the way since it was so clearly bs and frankly a ton of other mean condescending and controlling things in and out of work that he said was part of the job which included driving around employees and himself before and after work without compensating gas or time thing was my complaints went no where since the client was best friends with super and one of the requirements for our company having the gig was keeping super on so it was either suck up or leave well i needed the job and the other guards needed a buffer between them and super related to revenge i had sold him a broken car he knew it was broken for some small sum of money he had to scrap it i used that money for this next part see super had a problem he was diabetic worse than that he didnt seem to think it was that big of a deal checked his level maybe once a week using the money from the car purchase i did the only thing that came to mind something my father once told me when someone makes to mad kill them with kindness so thats what i did using that money i had bought so much candy and sweets just for him cookies jolly ranchers caramel soda recies pieces fun size king size assorted bags german chocolate everything id give him as much candy as he would take and hed take a lot see he doesnt buy candy or unhealthy things normally but if put on a plate hed eat it just the same i knew this would take a long time but i had the time and patience to spare i could wait it took years before the medical problems started happening he started going to the doctor more often would never say what was happening though he would start to deny my sweet poison until he saw me enjoying myself then he couldnt resist perhaps he was a stress eater who knows i had eventually moved to a different position nonsecurity related but i still kept in touch with security there as well as leave my rather large collection of candy for supers consumption turns out he had to quit working security turns out he had functionality left of his kidneys last i heard he was having extreme numbnessswelling in his feet as well extreme perhaps but perhaps he shouldnt have stuffed his face and taken his disease a bit more serious the rest of the security team was happy to not have super around they were now free to do their jobs that is until the next super super came around which is another prorevenge tale in and of itself if people want i can tell that one as well part 
my mom was the second oldest growing up and had brothers her parents always thought of her as the good kid but only because she wasnt as wild as her brothers especially the younger ones and was sneakier about it the following story is one of her favorites and is honestly more brutal than any experience i ever had growing up the youngest of my moms brothers was j and he was a real terror when he was a kid one day at the house when they were both very young my mom notices j sharpening a pencil normally that wouldnt be too big of a deal but he kept going and going on the crank one of those old grindy manual sharpeners all the while giving her an evil smile my mom realized whats coming so she took off running and j started chasing her around the house making stabbing motions with the pencil like an idiot this went on for a little while before my mom suddenly thought about it and wondered why she was running after all he may have had a sharp pencil but she was older and she should be able to use her seniority to put j to back in his place instead of running away like he wanted she stopped turned around with her hand held straight out and shouted at j to stop this probably would have worked except j was too close to stop and he ended up stabbing the pencil through my moms hand when he ran into her i dont know where the adults were before all this but they showed up and took my mom to the hospital everything was sorted out with no lasting damage im sure j was punished for what he did in some way but my mom can carry a grudge and she was not satisfied yet my mom got better and soon after she was able to get her revenge j and my mom were playing a game of tether ball outside and j just so happened to have a bottle of coke that he was drinking from this is back in the days when coke was only sold in those tall glass bottles at some point during the game it was my moms turn to serve the ball when j picked up his bottle to take a drink she saw her chance and took it without thinking she served the ball and watched as it soared around the pole and directly into the back of the bottle j was drinking from my mom was able to play it off as an accident at the time and j had to get new teeth put in but once again there wasnt any long term damage tldr my uncle semiintentionally stabbed my mom in the hand with a pencil so she used a tether ball to knock out his top front teeth
i love riding bicycles im good at it and im safe in this story i was riding on a busy but necessary street at night helmet reflectors and flashing lights were in use a bunch of bros in a big suv came up close beside me and started swerving towards and away from me while yelling and taunting trying to crash me into parked cars i ignored them as best i could and they gave up soon but as they pulled away i hocked a great gob of spit towards their vehicle i was hoping to hit the windshield but to my happy surprise it entered the passenger window and i heard an angry exclamation of surprise i like to imagine that it hit that fucker square in the face tldr suv goons tried to run me off the road i spit in one of their faces from behind
so i have this cousin who can definitely be an ass first of all he thinks he is a hot shot he works at apple but is one of those home advisors truth is he probably only makes about per hour i personally make about a year regardless of the circumstance he tries to make it sound like he is better than me for example he tells my friends that im not very bright not going to go through the reasons but i am definitely brighter he also brags that once he gets married or moves in with his girlfriend he will be making ton of money and get a better house than me there are other examples but you can take the hint this guy is an ass now his girlfriend is the exact opposite she is completely cool and she is finishing school for a pharmacist he treats her like shit rarely pays for dates doesnt open the car door for her etc he really doesnt know how to treat a woman you may be wondering why she puts up with this crap the truth is she has a low self esteem of herself no idea why cause she has it all im not a person who usually commits any kind of revenge as i figure a person will get what eventually is coming to them but once i got some breaking info i decided to use it to my advantage when the ashley madison leaks happened i did a search to see who is on the list searched a lot and got nothing but all of a sudden i got my cousins email to come up at first i was thinking why would he be on this i was thinking it was some kind of weird curiosity i then downloaded the database on one of my vm sure enough i did a awk and sed for the addresses and his popped up he made credit card transactions that totaled about they took place when his girlfriend was away at college now i know this guy cheated on her this was enough for me clearly he was using her as a sugar momma i was thinking just approach her and give her the papers but she might just dismiss it since she thinks i made this up to sabatoge him plus i didnt want to be known for breaking up the relationship so i sent an anonymous big envelope with her school info as the return address that way she would more than likely open it i gave her all the info to prove he was cheating on her with married women well it took a couple of weeks but she finally broke up with him i found out she spoke to my brother in laws wife as they are close she helped seal the deal both my brother in law and wife didnt think my cousin was right for his girlfriend and they wanted them to break up but there is more to the story it was a big deal he lost his meal ticket to riches but something else came out of this so apparently he was going to the genius bar where he used to work and was stealing tons of small stuff like usb cables power adapters cases and etc his ex knew it but again with the low self esteem she never said anything well she turned him in to the local apple store and apple eventually fired him afte investigating this caused a spiral of events he lost his truck and now stuck living with his mom hes years old and still stuck with mommy needless to say his bragging is much less tldr arrogant cousin pisses me off find he cheats on his girlfriend through ashleu madison told his girlfriend lost his girlfriend and his job
this was a few years ago when i was in final year of highschool i found out one of the students in the year below thought he was smart by hacking all the girls emails by setting up email forwarding when they left their computers alone he had been listening in on gossip that was being shared around that he had no business of looking at so the next time in web dev class i set up a quick script that would spam his email address with s of messages as it turns out since it was running over the local network i was sending email faster then it could be processed by his inbox and it ended up at allowance he couldnt move email to trash because he was over allowance the system couldnt cope he goes to the it office to get his email account looked at and the school it guy couldnt even fix it he had to issue him a new login when asked why his email was full of messages from an unknown source he couldnt answer so i suspect that the it guy figured he had spammed his own account
first this story isnt as extreme as the last story at least as far as the revenge goes however super deserved worse as i said before i had moved to another job after security this job was in that building super had told new boss boss from here on out not to hire me that i was lazy rude distracted ect however boss had known me for years at this point and known this was not true i made sure boss did not regret hiring me and took any assignment or overtime he needed covered all jobs were done when they needed to be done i was the go to guy in my new job super had gotten sick and left his position instead of promoting anyone they had hired super into the position literally everyone else in the building knew how to do supers job better than he did come to find out super is really just super likes to take naps pass the blame ect ssdd only super had an additional hobby he like to allegedly sexually harass the female guards multiple to my knowledge at least by as many guards complaints were filed with both the company and the sec companys hr every one of those guards were transferred to another site at this point the guards that ive trained and worked with still see me as part of the team i was the lead after all but there was nothing i could have done i was no longer working with them only thing i could do was to let them know to warn the female guards ahead of time and to keep an eye out some time after all this i broke a rule my mistake i admit that i wont get into it because its far too long for my patience to type out what is relevant are the below details i broke rule super was sleeping during this time super didnt like that i broke rule and made a big deal out of it i made it a bigger deal since mutually assured destruction was an acceptable outcome in my book turns out it reached the clevel also turns out the clevel cared more about the details of the people responsible for protecting the building than me breaking that rule i got called into a phone meeting where super boss my boss and super were on the other end i was told to drop it by them my boss knew i was telling the truth but didnt want to lose me respect him for looking out but this is when super made it my business he called me a liar that everything i dug up all the evidence all the forged reports were all lies everyone in that room knew the truth but he called me a liar im a dick yea but im not a liar by any stretch and that set me off see everyone knew me from my days as security and i knew everyone from clevel and down to the janitor i had asked a c that i was friendly with what the deal was he said there wasnt enough evidence after showing him what i collected he says this never made it up to him i was confused and did some digging turns out that my boss was a little too trusting of supers boss supers boss liked to keep things to himself because if super looked bad his boss would look bad the clevel guy said not to worry hed take care of it a week later super was out the door my evidence plus some i didnt collect helped put him there also the security company was told that if they didnt take proper action against super then there wouldnt be a contact for them anymore they ended up losing the contract anyways because they never let the company know about the harassment issues and that could endanger the employees currently the super for security is a guy i personally trained and trust overall a really good guy if a bit strict but thats ok things are better for my old team and things are better for me since then im not a good story teller so if some things dont makes sense please let me know edit let lose the typos of war
my own story of revenge after a mutual friend of a number of my friends ended up knowingly and with malice screwed a couple of us out of each we decided it was time mount a pay back campaign not sure if it is still an option but remember how the little magazine subsciption inserts that always fell out used to say bill me later next to the credit card info well we spread out a individually amassed and filled out a pile of the raunchiest magazines we could find then moved onto all the kid mags we could find then on and on till we had a massive pile that he would have to slowly deal with for years to come not satisfied yet we moved onto to browsing the internet for as many sign ups as we could find starting with a nambla mailing list na aa and various organ failure support groups akin to fight club and so on the list goes on and on all calling his phone to remind him of the next meeting finally feeling tired of all the paper work revenge we satisfied our need for some physical revenge by using a super glue syringe and some epoxy to effectively seal every truck and door lock we could get to from the outside of his house 
story here copied for easy reading gtdidnt walk in but found out she was sleeping with a vp of our company and had planned a trip to napa valley over our anniversary under the guise of a business trip gtwent to hr and homeboy was promptly fired since she was under him tee hee and kicked her out of the house 
this is a story about my ex wife sharron i thought she was the love of my life we met while i was in grad school while she was working as an intern at the library i frequented we clicked immediately and the rest was history within years we were married and living happily ever after i worked hard to get where i am at the firm i work at this included sometimes hour work weeks but most of the time i was only working between hours depending on the project w weekends off she meanwhile just worked as s and never finished school up we were members at a fitness club and she would increasinly spend time there more and more even though she just used it for the spa part and never really worked out soon it was getting ridiculous she was also more and more guarded about her phone so one night we were drunk and she passed out then her phone buzzed and an unknown number popped up asking if i was gonna be at work the next day she was smart and never had any messages saved over days from him but the texts were damning i forwarded them to me and kept the information the marriage was done right then and there and to think we were gonna try for kids i immediately withdrew us from the club which pissed her off and caused a huge fight but i said we have to save up for the baby and a new house she reluctantly agreed she never did have the best metabolism so this was bad for her i then set up cameras in the house for future use of course in court i just needed time to collect my thoughts and my evidence and plot i went on business trips and recorded her fucking the guy in our bed that was it for me i hated her i spent the next months buying greasy foods more and more beer and loading our dinners with fatty foods and pastabread each morning i would wake up early and get us donuts every morning for that time she easily gained lbs over that timei gained like lbstotally worth it i also did what i could to be the best husband ever over that time i called her all sorts of things and treated her like a princess so she wouldnt suspect a thing i made the most romantic gestures and made our year anniversary a dream vaction of hers i did everything she wanted in bed and indulged in her deepest desires i brought her shopping almost biweekly and took her to the best restaurants i wanted her to know how much i loved her and would say things like i would never hurt you i would always love you youre mine forever were a team etc and you feel the same way right i dont know if it was the extra weight or the romantic gestures but she seemed to stop going to him and was spending more and more time with me and refell in love i suppose now was the time to strike after saving up quite a bit we had a serious talk about starting the process of having a kid it sucked becuase this could have been one of the best conversations of my life but instead it became the focal point of my revenge we would do this thing where we would send eachother a text about what we were thinking even if we were face to face it originated in all that time in the library together and was reserved for romantic lovey dovey or sexual texts long story short this kind of communication was very intimate and special to us so right when we started to talk i said sharron take your phone out she knew what this meant and was grinning ear to ear she probably thought i was gonna say something cuteinstead i sent her a video the look on her face was priceless she couldnt speak she couldnt move she was paralyzed she began bursting in tears and said she stopped seeing him months ago and that it only happened a handful of times and that i worked too much and she was lonely and she was sorry and that he meant nothing and that we could move past it and have kids she was a wreck i told her she shattered my heart and that i could never forgive her and that she was everything to me she was ecstatic begging me to stay saying she would do anything i simply said no and that i already had a lawyer and that she could damn well bet that infidelity clause was gonna bite her harder than a bull shark in the divorce i let her keep her car that i bought and all her assets we had a split bank account since it was easier i gave her the last months on our lease and that was it she got even bigger and looks like shit now she tries to contact me all the time but i just never respond best part she can see that its read i really dont have feelings for her at all she was in retrospect so selfish and only looked after herself and others if they suited her needs her parents were class acts and were so sorry to hear what she did to me i doubt they even talk to her my ex mol loved me shes alone as far as i can tell and struggling tbh i pity her and feel bad because she used to be beautiful currently im not looking to date im and in the best shape of my life making great money i post all my fun times and frequently with with beautiful girls from vationing or clubbing or whatever im up to that given weekend my new single life is actually amazing and ive found a new part of me that would have been lost with her i shattered her soul body mind and heart by giving her everything and taking it away at the perfect time nothing too elaborate but enough to inflict lasting damage the revenge doesnt feel that good now since i barely think of her but its nice everynow and then to see my greatest enemy be diminished to a spec 
i had an extremely annoying client who either never wanted to pay me for my services computer repair or would be so nitpicky about everything that it was never worth my time to do anything for him he ran a radio station over the internet that supposedly had several thousand listeners and mainly played old rampb except on sundays which played gospel he brought the computer that did the broadcasting in one day and wanted me to fix it he would constantly get it infected with viruses and has absolutely no sense whatsoever in using a computer but he insisted he left it overnight the problem was resolved within just a few minutes i hit him with a bill on it because i hate him which he immediately balked at ok i thought lets do this then i loaded up his software and broadcast this all night long he was there waiting for me the next morning when i opened up paid left and i havent heard from him since
more than a few years ago i used to work at a college that was quite frankly a travesty nonetheless i worked there helping students i fancied myself as a bit of a programmer then and worked a deal with one of the students to reprogram his familys website revamping photos redoing layout and design third party tools and services that were free so that they could have the functionality they wanted for free without a major spot of programming on a server that wouldnt let them have those services anyway think super basic web hosting the works i did it for a cutthroat rate cutting my own throat that is and after looking at the code i told him look i know you guys did this in front page originally after im done with the things you want you wont be able to update it with front page again because youll break it i told him this three or four times he acknowledged it each time and i set to work back at this time front page couldnt handle complex code or layouts because anything more complicated than a table was trouble if you tried to change it with front page it might look right on the screen but it wouldnt work in the browser so there was no way to know until you saved over the original whether you broke it or not each phase of the work elicited a great response i would do a block of work and upload it to the server and hed pay me he went in there once to make a small change and totally borked the site you used front page didnt you yup ill fix it but its going to cost you more because i told you not to do that and that starts going into support and maintenance which you dont want you just want code design and thats it he agreed coughed up the money whoopee and then i went about working on the rest of the site once i finished however he withheld the two final payments about and changed the password to the site so that i couldnt upload the final block of work and couldnt take down anything else i had already uploaded basically he wanted it something like of the way there and that was good enough for him and it didnt seem to matter much that he was basically stealing i actually had halfway expected this because he was arrogant and abusive to people most of the time but you can only eat so much ramen before it started to turn your stomach and i was tired of not eating i counted myself just fine with this for the most part i mean i had already made a couple hundred off him and his family and it was more than i would have made if i hadnt done it he didnt know everything on the site yet and hadnt used every part of it he basically went to the links i sent him agreed to the work and i moved on to the next part cue the third party services my ace in the hole see since he couldnt actually change the site anymore without front page totally mucking it up and breaking the whole thing and i had never given him the passwords to the third party services that literally covered his site i went in and changed the third party content so that it displayed what a thief he was i considered it fair play and even up he never noticed i swear months went buy and he never even noticed eh no big deal at some point his family would notice and then hed either have to explain to them why there were notices like that all over the place or have to explain to them how he stiffed me i considered it done and over with and on that it was i just resolved to never deal with him again unless i had to for work turns out that i did indeed have to but not for a while in fact his abusiveness towards other people disappeared completely for a while and i began to wonder if hed just turned over a new leaf because you know people can do that i didnt feel one bit sorry for what id done tit for tat but i wasnt angry at him any more the school year progressed and i began to feel a little sorry for him because he was starting to have all kinds of problems including with life in general we ended up chatting once in a while again and he let me know that he was about to get a metric fuckton of old computers that were being retired from the college and wanted to know if id build some out of the working spare parts and any other working spare parts left over would be mine i figured hell no way he can screw me on that one so i said sure after verifying with the college that it was good and legit so i picked up computers that were old and failing built about working pcs out of it delivered them back to him for him to sell i got a whole footlockers worth of spare parts not including cases or power supplies a few weeks later he and i had been talking he had a disability it wasnt hidden and there was a piece of software that hed come into one of the labs to use i worked multiple departments that allowed him to finish most of his assignments and was targeted at people with his specific disability it was something like at the time and the department head in charge at the time thought it was just fine to leave the install discs on the desks in the computer lab in case the cds were needed for anything i told him look i know you need this software and i know how much of a royal pain it is for you to bring yourself all the way across campus when you can put that on your laptop and use it in your dorm room im not always there but the cds are on the desk the lab staff know you and would think nothing of it if you were to bring in your laptop and play with the cd and whatnot he got what i was trying to say he said as much i felt bad for the guy you know it didnt require activation had no product key etc i made it clear that he should not do this while i was there because while i had no problem pretending that i didnt know he wanted it and would plan to copy it but that i also couldnt and wouldnt turn a blind eye if i caught him i made that abundantly clear he nodded and was still pretty grateful that i let him know all the same about a month passed and he started becoming extremely abusive to everyone again but much worse this time one particular day i had had enough when i walked into the room and he started off with okay dumbass blahblahblahidontremembertherestbecauseofalltheabusehespitout my eye actually twitched a few times i didnt trust him anymore and walked up to the lady in charge of the security of that special software look i know that cost about per disc and youve got them laying out there for any student to just walk away with after a brief conversation where i had to actually work to get her to understand this she finally agreed a few days later abusive boy was back in the lab i nodded at him he came over hey that lady is going to lock up those cds if youre going to bring your laptop in and copy it you should probably bring it tonight just make sure im not in the room he smiled and headed out of the room about minutes later it was time to close up the lab i had taken to checking the software every night because ill be damned if its my neck on the line lo and behold one of them was missing i sighed i knew what he had done i had told him very specifically to bring his laptop in not to take the cd out trying to help the poor guy out right the worst part about is that even though i knew it was him i couldnt just leave knowing that there was a small chance it could have been someone else i knew well enough that hed actually bring it back but if it were someone else it might never come back i had to report it i walked up to the main desk and reported the theft told campus security yes i know someone was in that room i know who it was i doubt he took it all the same hey i wasnt too thrilled with the guy but i wasnt about to pin it on him if i didnt have absolute proof and i didnt know for a fact just strongly suspected campus security found him wandering around campus with the disc he was kicked out of the college his senior year within the week with only months left in the school year turns out that for various reasons the money he spent there for classes was wasted because none of those credits were transferable like i said the college was a travesty
this is a story i debated whether to put in here or rpettyrevenge i decided this had some weight so ill put it here first but like there later on this happened to me only this week so its nice and fresh in my mind backstory in need of work i asked around to my friends and then found out through a good friend of a mine that there was a place opening up ideal location and industry for me i had lengthy chats with the owner of this new franchise that was opening up i had more business experience than him so i brought them up to speed and went above and beyond helping him out before i was even employed by them as long as i was guaranteed a job this was a franchise job that was based around commissions i would earn based on clients i would pull in the job was supposed to start at the beginning of june i had other commitments but i started shuffling all of them to fit around this job because at least situation wise it was perfect even if the wage was average june comes around and im still waiting to hear from the owner nothing i chase him up and get told the franchise is not going ahead days later its suddenly going ahead again and so its all stations go from the end of july fair enough delays can happen with new businesses owner is worried about leaving his high paying job to take over secondary job in the franchise to help out as i would be only employee so i help out and reach out to friends with same skill set as myself so they can take his position and he gets to keep his high paying job lets call owner d for douche and my friends g and g current story myself and g get hired no contract yet important to start advertising and walking around with flyers to advertise the new franchise g quits their other job because of assurances of shiftsmoneywork with the franchise during this advertising we get asked by the local council to move on as its illegal under those laws to do what we were doing but with a permit it would be legal pass this onto d and move on from the area g was interviewed and promised a job and work that myself and g were already doing they were waiting on schedules and contracts to start but d was delaying and not answering phone calls after the first venture to advertise i find out from g that d has decided to replace her years of study and years of experience with a year old girl weeks study and no experience and d has also been ducking my calls about this and the council this being a job that g had left her only source of income for that fell totally down because d likes young dumb things g was young and attractive but smart activate anger stage g was not contacted at all for weeks until the same afternoon that g was let go telling her after guaranteeing a job that she would not be able to work for them after all and apparently d was relying on me to fill shifts with the young dumb thing all of this he was doing behind my back after i had gone out of my way so many times to help him including getting these girls on board and us putting many things on hold to help him anger stage before i had found out what he had done to g and g d had tried to get me to do the exact same thing with the flyers in a close region i had protested as i had already been asked to leave the area before and d responded with gt whats the worst they could do send me a letter he was pushing very hard so i went and looked up the law i found out going back there especially after a warning i could be fined if not be criminally prosecuted i told d of this and he attempted to force me to still do this work but of course would not do it himself kaioken x finally i find out about all above situations and then also notice that he has been out working for his franchise d knowing im supporting a sick partner and struggling financially and even after going out of my way for months to help his business out and him as an individual with no pay he had decided to take every shift where a client could sign up and get commission which of course went straight into his pocket when he was already well off from his other job and refused to let me on board to do these other shifts cutting me out of hundreds of dollars super saiyan so for the revenge with the work he had tried to force me into i have all the copies of ds marketing materials he would use to encourage business for the future weeks instead of blasting him about his unprofessional ism and general doucheyness i decided to email him i got a better job with better benefits and that i would be passing all marketing material onto g so she could keep encouraging business for him of course i dont know at this stage hes been a horrible douche to g and go rid of her hes faced with the choice of either having to personally confront her face to face after being a major dick to her or he looses thousands of dollars of marketing flyers and material i am a member of a close knit community within my industry and immediately put out an apb that this owner was a dick and noone should work for him in any fashion and should in fact encourage others to stay away from him community is well respected and known within industry also should put out a notice to any potential clients or recent sign ups that they are likely to get messed around and treated poorly by said owner despite staffs best intentions last thing you need right as your trying to get a franchise off the ground end to even break even which i do know d was having trouble doing my favorite part of the revenge the friend i heard about this job from attends the same religious community that d does i took great satisfaction in informing this friend of every single one of ds antics and attitude including screencaps of him encouraging me to perform illegal activities and him not caring about me being fined etc this friend is highly respected within his religious community and took it upon himself to inform the elders of the community of how d is not acting within any of the guidelines of the community and will be severely reprimanded if not excommunicated this is also his entire network of personal friends who now get to find out just how poorly he treats those he would be responsible for i would i have liked to do more but at least for now it will suffice tldr franchise owner fucks me and my friends around after hours of unpaid work and so i go out of my way to ruin his reputation within the industry as well as within his personal reputation within his church community

i used to work in a martial arts supply store the store was generally dead and i used to leave a sign up in the window that read back in there were a couple of customers who would just drop by to chat once in a while one of them was named huey huey had a tkd background we sparred a couple of times and our respective styles made it pretty interesting suffice to say he was fast how fast real fast he dropped by my work for a chat one day and i decided to grab a coffee from across the street cue the customary sign in the window huey had come with one of those gargantuan gas station plastic soda cups and had been sipping from it i worked next to a very busy road and was equidistant between the two places where a pedestrian could cross well fuck the law we waited until there was a pretty good gap in traffic and jogged across a car pulled up on one of the side streets when we were almost all of the way across and turned onto the road we were on and just gunned it straight for us engine at excessive rpms that thing was loud i picked up the pace and got out of its way but not huey huey planted both of his feet in the middle of the road and i watched his veins start to bulge from his neck as the driver had to rapidly apply his brakes and avoid huey he honked and flicked huey off fast as shit huey hucked that monstrosity hed been drinking from right at the car dudes window was down and i cant swear to it but i think he got splashed the driver braked and slowed surveying the damage or thinking about taking huey and i on no idea huey turned to look at the car and i noticed that his eyes had become bloodshot that piece of shit pimped along and we went for coffee
i had a plan to get vengeance on an acquaintance who stole a shit ton of soda from my great uncles shop but recently gained proof and acted on it so this asshole well call him jacob would come in to my great uncles shopi worked there for summer break would come in and walk suspiciously around the shop and would disappear from the surveillance cameras sight range momentarily i purchased a sound receiving el cheapo from target and set it up in a blind spot almost a whole month passes then he comes in again and walks into the snack isles and begins to grab a case of sodadont know what kind and walks to the usual spot he begins to shove it in his backpack grunting and it wouldnt fit the bag i walked over the area and see him trying to stuff this in his bag i confront him and tell him he has to pay for the soda and never come back he tells me he has no money on him and tries to tell me some sob story about his dead grandpa or something that made him steal i confiscate the soda and put it back i take his phone from his bag and call his parents and try get them to come down to the shop his parents dont answer and i leave a message he leaves months pass and he is back with a friend i tell him to leave and he walks back to the snack isles and begins to try and take more shit than last time still unaware of the camera i tell him to stay away from the shop or i will call the cops but of course he is back again i allow him in a few more times but steal all merchandise back from his bag every time he arrives he and his fat friend would go next door and leave their bags here when he keeps coming back enough becomes enough i await his arrival and take his bike from the rack and place it in the road first me and my friend take turns scratching it and pouring gasoline on it we run his friends bike over with my truck and burn the other when they come back to the rack i throw them out permanently and threaten to slap their shit if they come back i havent heard from them again
first off this is a throwaway account and a long post ive been subbed to pettyrevenge for a while so i would think this story im about to tell is more prorevenge than petty this memory is still fresh in my mind because the revenge that the cooks took was absolutely disgusting and they later had my back on my subsequent revenge against the same manager theirs was extremely gross and unsanitary while mine crippled restaurant operations for a couple days due to lack of water this is my first post to this sub a sidenote i dont condone messing with anyones food i never did when i finally rose the ranks and became a cook myself about a year or so later at a different restaurant in the chain background the year was mid to late s and i was working as a dishwasher in my late teens right after high school i had just left from a cashier position at a local home improvement chain that was big in my area when i was living in that area it was a subsidiary of a local grocery store chain that has since expanded into several states the home improvement chain has since closed since home depot started expanding at the time all over the country anyways i quit that job and a friend got me a job at the restaurant i applied for a pastry job and during my interview the horrible gm asked if i didnt mind washing dishes for weeks then hed let me go on to do pastry i thought that was a decent offer not knowing that he had absolutely no intentions of letting me do pastry not knowing that tidbit i took the job and ended up being a dishwasherbusboy for a year when i learned that the gm had no intentions of holding up his end of the deal i was furious but needed a job background preface at the hour restaurant two cooks ill refer to as joe and mike were two guys who were overworked and under appreciated theyd get in around late lunch had to work through dinner and bar shift until the early morning these guys hated the gm i was generally the dishwasher on their shifts and they took to me as one of their own it was because they were friends with my best friend at the time who helped me get the job i was the cleanest dishwasher got them stacks of clean plates like clockwork always left the dishwashing station extremely clean when other dishwashers didnt i got shit if i even thought about leaving the area less than perfect while other dishwashers got away with being sloppy other dishwashers could call in sick but i couldnt even if i was sick as a dog they knew about me getting shafted on tips when i bussed tables since i confided in them they knew about the gm screwing me over basically these two cats really felt my pain one day they had had enough and executed their revenge the revenge one day the gm was being his usual asshole self to us and decided to order a cheeseburger or something of that nature from the menu for his break joe and mike got into revenge mode joe decides to dip the gms burger patty into a filthy mop bucket a few times will mike went to go take a shit if your imagination is running wild at this point as to where this is all going it should joe throws the burger on the grill and lets it cook for a bit takes it off the grill and dips it a little more into the dirty mop bucket mike finishes his business and after wiping his ass takes some shit off his toilet paper and smears it all over the top of the burger then throws some cheese on that bitch they cook it to temp put it on some buns plates some fries and calls out to the server telling them the food was ready all three of us stand in the galley and watch as the gm gobbles down the mop bucket shit smeared cheeseburger actually enjoying his food grossest thing i had ever witnessed in person even though they scrubbed the grills and stoves from that day forward i refused to order food from the place while on break i went to local establishments to eat even though they told me i had nothing to worry about tldr cooks get revenge on a horrible boss by fixing him up a mop bucket dipped shit smeared cheeseburger 
supposedly the girl said she would get back at him somehow for all the lawsuits sterlings ex wife filed against her i know this sub is just for stories of prorevenge but this seems to be the biggest public revenge story ever mill fine banned for life forced to sell 
background my friend zack sells a lot of weed and mdma and has a very strong sense of justice his friend of a few years casey is a real thug and just comes off like a real shady guy in my eyes one day zack tells me to no small surprise that casey is refusing to pay a substantial sum of money to him casey tells all his friends that zack is threatening him and all sorts of things to keep their friends on caseys side casey then says that if zack ever tries to get his money back that he will call the cops in on his operation very easy considering caseys family affiliations zack asks for my expertise in getting some revenge and i tell him that im not prepared to do what he asked but to keep me in the loop if i can help some other way some time down the road zack asks me about a guy i know jim and whether i can trust him i tell him i should be able to and he lets me in on his plan zack has got a substantial amount of bud that was grown in a rainforest and basically left to fend for itself most of the bud got mouldy and the end product would have been near impossible to smoke never the less he kept the rotten stuff and dried it very quickly in a food dehydrator it wasnt smokeable but it was still incriminating then he let me know that jim was family friends with caseys family and had been left in charge of house sitting while the family was on vacation jim makes a call to casey and says that some guy called zach came round to pick up his stuff casey springs into action and soon enough the police are investigating zach for claims of robbery trespassing and dealing weed they quickly found that zack had been at a wedding and visiting family in the time that this had happened and after being invited into his property they found nothing out of the ordinary then the police came to check caseys house jim of course told them that the only call he had with casey in that time frame was about the family dog and when the police check caseys room even though the door was still looked they find a large quantity of pretty nasty pretty illegal marijuana casey is under investigation right now and it seems that the cops have found out he is dealing coke and ketamine zack never got his money back but all of casey and zacks mutual friends are now coming to zack for business which means he is making more than ever i cant say i condone any of this but i did feel that while it was risky it was good to see that caseys violent threats were met with a craftier revenge than vandalism or violence
so awhile ago i posted asking for long story short the estate agents didnt own one of the fridges the seven tenants of the house just sold it on to the next set of tenants for each year and this year the welsh lads moving in flat out refused to pay since making the post one of my housemates heard them talking about scoring a free fridge so that confirmed my suspicion they were just calling our bluff and trying to get it for free rather than just not caring i tried to donate it somewhere no one offered to take it from gumtree before we left and the local places either charged or so collection fee wouldnt take an old fridge or would only take it if i could get it to the place and the problem in the first place was that i had no way of moving it myself so sadly no one benefited from a fridge however i have hopefully made sure the new tenants can use it as nothing but decor based on the suggestions in my original thread the day i left i turned everything off and cleaned it all out nice and neatly then took absolutely everything that could be removed from it the fridgefreezer now has no shelves in the main part or the door because they could still just use it to refrigerate beer or something i slit the rubber band sealing thing in a dozen or so places i have no idea if itll do anything but fingers crossed itll make it leak cold constantly the girl who moved in first out of us said it was still full of junk when she moved in which means the estate agents dont look inside which is great because i lined both doors with half a tube of superglue that wed used to fix a chair finally even though people said it would be too easy to fix i cut the power cord almost completely through left a little wiring still attached right up near the base of the fridge hopefully they wont even notice until they manage to pry open the door tldr new tenants refused to pay for a fridge as per everyone else had done also found out they were in fact calling our bluff and expecting to get it for free cut the power cable near the base its not noticeable and is still attached but should burn out after a little use removed all the shelves and containery things inside there is nothing but the floor of the fridge and freezer compartment to put stuff on cut the rubber seal on the door all over the place superglued the door shut enjoy asshole students xd

one sentence story from a this morning
so the other day i was taking my girlfriend to work on my lunch break because her car broke down because it was my lunch i was strapped for time i was speeding not excessively on the freeway about mph over and right as i am passing a big rig he the asshole not the big rig cuts me off doing mph under the speed limit he proceeds to tap his brakes just to be an asshole so i go around him and get in front of him doing this somehow upset the man and he decided to follow me me being the nice guy that i am waited until we were on the junction between two freeways to break check him to the point where he had to skid to stop in time me and my girlfriend let out a chuckle and continued to go to her work she works at a restaurant right across from the mall in our town so not wanting this crazy to know where she works i take her to the closest spot near her work and tell her to walk straight across the lane intersection and i will ditch this dude she does this and at this point he caught up to me and rolls down his window yelling at me trying to get me to get out of my car i simply dont have time for this fuckhead so i plan to lose him through the city my hometown before heading back onto the freeway and going back to work as soon as i pull out of the parking lot there is a motorcycle cop right in front of me so i whistle at him doesnt phase him so i honk he merges over to the lane next to me and stops at the red light i roll down the window hey buddy there is this crazy guy in the brown truck a couple cars back that is trying to fight me or something he cut me off on the freeway a few miles back and followed me to the mall where i had to drop my girlfriend off for work i dont have time to deal with this guy right now can you help me out his response was the toyota i nod thank him and drive off looking in my rearview i see the cop wait for him to catch up to me then immediately light his ass up i immediately pull my phone out to call my girlfriend to inform her of how awesome that was
in myself and a large group of friends went to a music festival there was one girl with us ill call her rachelbecause that was her name who was not a part of the insular group of friends she was a friend of one of the people in the group but none of the rest of us had ever met her so we get to the mountain and set up camp my friends and i decide to go see a dj rachel does her own thing and separates from us we arrive at the very top of the mountain and have fun for a few hours and decide to return to camp when we return we all observe rachel straight up in my tent looking for valuables however this was not my first rodeo and i made sure to keep my camera all prescription medications etc in a backpack and with me at all times the entire group immediately confronted her she was making excuses that were altogether unfounded saying that she was on drugs and had gotten confused and thought that she was in her own tent her tent looked and had an interior nothing like mine though the most glaring example was that mine had a sleeping bag inside it and hers had an air mattress there were many other examples and during the course of the confrontation her story evolved so we all knew that she was lying fast forward about hours in the future rachel is sleeping soundly in her tent now another friend of mine is a new mother and has a breast pump on her she has been pumping for the last hours and putting the milk into a jar saving it we go in her tent where she is asleep and my friend pours her half rancid breast milk all over this chicks face but we are not done with the revenge there rachel did not wake up after having milk splashed on her so i go back in there and grab her bag i never had any intent of stealing anything out of it thats just not me but i did take it into a porta potty and took a huge dump in it and then returned it to her tent about hours later she wakes up and grabs her purse and exits her tent and we are all really mean to herso she packs up all of her stuff and leaves the festival never noticing that her purse is full of poop we all had a great laugh session over this and it is kind of a big deal type story around where i live dc
not my story but a family members who i shall call tommy tommy was in a bar in the united states about years ago to watch a college football game with a bunch of business partners the bar was very crowded and while outside smoking a fight broke out nearby the overzealous bouncers started tossing people around and tommy who was just standing there innocently got tossed literally tossed he fell over a railing onto concrete about feet down he gashed his face broke his hand and when he tried to get back in to get his possessions was told to fuck off before he was arrested his friend tried to get his jacket from their table inside but it was gone i dont know if he pursued legalpolice action but i assume he did and was unsuccessful otherwise the following tale would not have occurred fast forward years handface healed after a few expensive surgeries and new jacket purchased but tommy still harbors a burning desire for revenge deep inside he finds out he will be going back to the area for business he lived elsewhere just so happens that the super bowl will be occurring this same weekend so tommy starts to plan and what he comes up with is perfect on super bowl sunday following a week of successful business he shows up at the bar it is near the end of the first half game very close with a bag containing his supplies at his side everyone is captivated by the intensity of the game and he slinks off to the mens room its a ghost town inside he quickly dons dish gloves and starts plugging up the sinks and overflowing them he shoves tennis balls inside the toilets and jams them all the way inside and flushes them to overflow as well i am not exactly sure the extent of work that went on beyond this but he did something to make the water flow continuously and was difficult to stop soon there is an overflow of watery pissshit dumping onto the floors work complete he exits the bathroom and takes up a vantage point nearby halftime whistle blows and everyone rushes for the bathroom with the intensity of adrian peterson blasting through tackles bladders are full and must be emptied he could only speculate on what occurred inside but its quite apparent that its cluster fuck guys come running out shoes wet and squishing flagging down stafflooking for other places to piss there are staff running around trying to stop the overflows and get the toilets operational while still serving the packed bar but it is too late the scene becomes more chaotic and tommy proud and satisfied with himself slinks away i believe they had to shut down the bar for the night after that there was a lot of water damage and revenue lost i dont know if there is a moral to this story maybe keep your dogs on a leash or never callously fuck over a paying patron i do know that tommy is a cold calculating mother fucker and he takes great pride in this either way i know who i am consulting if i ever need to exact revenge tldr tommy gets seriously injured by bouncer comes back years later and destroys bathroomruins superbowl for barcauses thousands in damage

i guess my son was in the second or third grade circa and there was this kid jt that picked on him constantly fairly certain the torture wasnt physical as my son was big for his age and taking martial arts it was mainly verbal stuff name calling etc the kid was a handful because i remember his desk was on the other side of the room from the other students and he ate lunch isolated anyway me son went to a different middle school than jt so there was a break in time when he around this kid so a few years pass and my son had been playing football for several years as a linemen playing both ways so you see where this is headed one beautiful fucking day jt shows up late to practice and a few days into the start of practices i was giddy as hell my son to this day is very mild mannered so i was wondering what was going to happen well i guess the gods of karma were with him this fine day damned if they didnt put jt across from my son on the line i honestly dont remember whether he was playing oline or dline but when they snapped the ball my boy ran over jt like he was a tackling dummy this happened a few more times until jt would ran away from my son like he was wielding an axe needless to say that was jts last practice

in when i was years old i started talking to a man i had met online lets call him b b was at the time about to be we met through the warped tour message boards and hit it off pretty quickly we would send long commentsmessages to each other all day everyday we had a lot of the same interests i enjoyed talking to him and i thought he was extremely cute i naturally started to like him but once i found out his age i knew hed just see me as jailbait and i got upset at the time like all year olds think i thought i was mature for my age and i was different which in some ways i was i had been through a lot but i still wasnt mentally grown and thats okay nobody really has to be at that age eventually we met b drove all the way to pennsylvania from michigan to see me he won over my grandma whom i lived with despite how old he was hes really good at that the women in my family always dated older anyway so in a way they thought they didnt have much to say for the first year and a half we dated long distance b would come to see me about every three weeks and we talked constantly when he wasnt around i truly thought this was something that would last when i was b proposed to me in a best buy parking lot and i thought i was going to spend the rest of my life with him when i was just shy of i dropped out of high school and moved to michigan to live with him and his mother since i didnt like where i lived and had a lot of family problems all was fine and dandy for a while b and i formed a serious band together i had always wanted to sing in a band it was always very important to me but i was never a good singer but the plan was to get vocal lessons and work my hardest to improve i started to not wanna be with him anymore in early so i spoke to him about it and he told me that if i left him he would have to kick me out of the band and the band was so important to me that i tried for the next few years to work it out i was unhappy pretty much the entire time but anytime i tried to leave him he would bring up the band or bring up the fact that him or i would never find anyone better for each other and if i left him id probably regret it so i stayed out of fear when i got around to years old i really started to outgrow him hes extremely immature for his age and everything that made him cool when i was made him annoying to me now the band went on to do a lot we recorded studio albums went on tour played warped tour etc i became a much better singer than i was at the start i took four years and counting vocal lessons with a grammy nominated instructor and i became someone he took seriously as a singer i worked my ass off last year i started to become very depressed with where i was at in life i still didnt drive because nobody would take the time to teach me and i didnt have family out here i couldnt hold a job because b would have us doing useless tours and the more we toured the worse the tours got i remember playing to many empty rooms and feeling hopeless i started liking other people i met this one guy and sadly ended up cheating on b and im not proud of it but after that i realized i needed to get out of my relationship with b i just felt scared and trapped and realized i was pretty emotionally manipulated by him at this point i confessed what i had done to b and told him we should break up at the time i was still living with him and he said as long as i payed rent i could continue to live there and we would still be in the band together and be good friends it would just take time but he wanted me to get back on my feet b cried over me for about a week and then started liking this other girl well call her m m was years old and by now he was years old i was shocked but i shouldnt of been because i was and he was when we first got together i was actually friends with m at first she had became a fan of our band about a year prior and i always thought she was cool her and i shared the same views on a lot of things or so i thought b and m were happy together it was pretty messed up but i decided that since b was so mentally immature that maybe it was okay and i wanted to see him happy because i had still felt bad for leavingcheating on b at the time not too long after b and m started to get on my nerves she would come over to the duplex b and i lived at and she would hang out with him and i would usually leave because the duplex had no doors and i wanted to give them alone time one night i set up a date during the same time and day so they could be alone i didnt have an issue with that because i liked them both and was happy for them my clothes were still in bs room so while i was about to get dressed i went over to kind of let them know beforehand that i was gonna come in real quick to get my clothes so i could get dressed i peered over a tiny bit and they were both laying in his bed with no shirts i found it pretty disrespectful and i was upset because i made plans to leave the house for them after that situation things had settled down between everyone or so i thought things went alright for a week or two after that and i was told i had to leave every wednesday from pm pm so they had some time together i think she was sneaking to see him between classes normally i wouldnt mind except one week i had the flu but my ex still forced me out and i sat in a coffee shop for three hours since i couldnt find anyone to hangout with me and i wasnt driving at the time not too long after that m absolutely lost her shit with me she started posting things on her tumblr about how im a cunt and im never going to do anything with myself and was trying to force b to throw me out and i at the time had nowhere else to go considering going back to my abusive family wasnt an option b did his best to stay neutral which i appreciated but that also didnt last long soon after he gave me a move out date of june st and it was around march at the time so i had threeish months to get my shit together i was a little nervous but i hoped i could do it at least b was giving me three months instead of listening to m and kicking me out as soon as possible one night b and i got into a fight pretty badly i dont really remember what it was about but im sure it had something to do with anything i posted above i lost my temper and told him i wasnt going to leave the apartment for m and him tomorrow and he told me that if i didnt i could get the fuck out and that i were not eat any of the food in the house and i could fucking starve i was at my wits end with this bullshit especially coming from a year old man a man eight years older than me catering to his cry baby brat year old girlfriend so i told him to stop messing with me or he would regret it he laughed in my face and told me to try so i went to bed and laid there and thought of exactly what i was going to do and i thought of the perfect plan and the next day i would set everything into motion the next day she came over during her usual time and i left without a fight when i got back she was just about to leave and he was about to go to work i believe he was closing that night or at least working late so i had a lot of time i start my plan by going through his ipad and getting every evidence i could to show how disturbing he was of course his password was the day they started dating so getting into it was no issue i read so many texts about how awful i was and how they didnt care if i got kicked out i was furious but i kept my cool i also listened to a lot of voice texts where he talked to her like she was a year old girl and it was very creepy unsurprised though because he used to do it to me he also hundreds of screen capped snapchats from her including a few nudes which is very illegal i took all this information and gave my mom a call at this time we had forgave each other for our abusive past relationship she was a little in the loop about what was happening and i knew she was a smooth talker so i told her that maybe she should give ms mom a call and let her know exactly how creepy b actually is since m still lives with her parents the next step was finding ms mothers phone number well call her j j was one of those people who had her phone number in her facebook about me perfect i was hoping it was the right number i sent it to my mom and my mom told me she would call me back and let me know what went down i anxiously waited for about minutes and then the phone rings its my mom my mom was on the phone with her mom for minutes talking about the entire history of b and how b corrupts young girls and though j knew it all along she didnt wanna forbid the relationship and push m closer to b so after my mom called j j wanted to speak with me i also went over my relationship with b to j and covered how manipulative controlling and creepy b was and i also told her all the texts i read as soon as m got home that day j told her that if she continued to see b she would kick her out of the house take her car and not pay for her schooling so m broke it off with b and apologized to me for the next few whenever i was around m i would poison the well and remind her how awful b was every time b was miserable for awhile and it was fun to watch since he made me so miserable i thought it was good karma they never ended up getting back together even though m wishes she could i think b is over it at this point but im just glad i gave myself a little more time to get back on my feet and proved to b not to mess with me b still goes after young girls sadly that will never change he likes to find girls he can manipulative and mold into exactly what he is tldr my ex in his s goes after a young girl again they tried to kick me out on the streets so i tell her mom everything and her mom makes her daughter break up with him edit formatting

when i was in th grade this kid was telling others i was a cocksucker i couldnt get him to stop so i resorted to drastic measures i had a pencil in my hand now its not what you think id been suspended several other times for defending myself from bullies and i had no intentions whatsoever of causing any real harm or anything the fucking pencil had no lead and you couldnt write with it or anything if i had hit him anywhere else with it i guarantee you nothing would have happenned but me being a stupid fucker i accidentally hit him in an artery on his arm the stupid pencil is latched on like glue and blood is literally squirting inches in the air like a fucking movie somebody even fainted long story short i get a week suspension reduced to days he gets a week suspension and counseling also when i was suspended because i wasnt in school i was allowed to go with my dad to a kickass air show nearby upon return lots of people told me thanks for doing that to the kid as he was the token dumbshit of our school
ive spent many years working in the general aviation industry basically working with private jets the crews and the principals because of my location we get a lot of political activity every four years as the various candidates get out and start traveling around its in large part a nonevent they are on standard biz aircraft and not much is required in terms of special handling that all changes when one of these folks becomes the candidate now theyre rolling around on commercial jet aircraft md they have a bunch of staff and the requisite protection to go along with it ok no problem our crew was very experienced did a lot of large aircraft sports charter and serious vip work we had all the appropriate equipment to service these airplanes ie stair trucks baggage carts belt loaders etc we also knew how big these airplanes are and how to maneuver and park them on the ramp believe it or not at this level aircraft handling is an art theres no straight line or jet way to pull up to you basically get one chance to get it right in this last election cycle we were getting the challenger to the throne in very regularly like one to three times a week ok a little bit of a hassle but from an airplane standpoint no big deal by and large everyone involved was reasonable and friendly the issues came about due to the fact that the members of the protection detail were always changing this was especially true of the agents in charge my understanding from talking to them is that they were on a set rotation schedule to keep everyone fresh and on their toes as far as we were concerned a simple confab with the saic about the details for the day was sufficient we would be clear on what they needed and we would handle the aircraft accordingly this usually revolved around how many cars busses equipment trucks etc that they had and where we were going to put them remember along with this were also trying to handle a constant flow of regular biz jets coming and going so coming up with a mutually beneficial plan was pretty key all is well and good until one day saic richard cranium is on the case he wasnt particularly old but he reminded me a lot of sherriff jw pepper louisiana state poeleese from the bond movies you know the type alright alright everybody stand back im in charge here the other ramp lead and myself just looked at each other in an oh great kind of way it was either this guys way or the highway he didnt want to hear or discuss anything about anything ok fine whatever so the plane comes in empty to pick up the candidate we get the plane fueled and serviced two sets of truck mounted airstairs two baggage belts for loading luggage into both holds the whole deal plane is ready and waiting easy peasy lemon squeezy so the press busses and the luggageequipment truck arrive no problems everything going well get them on the plane bags loaded cool now i dont know what this guys last assignment was but this wasnt af where all the principal has to do is get out of the car and get on the plane and go this candidate was always coming with several cars staff members additional luggage promo stuff etc nothing unusual or unexpected well once we had the plane serviced this saic went took it up about a thousand notches with the im in charge bit when he got the call that the motorcade was minutes out he decided that he was going to quarantine the entire ramp and make it a sterile area no ifs ands or buts about it the ramp was now off limits to anybody who wasnt approved and none of us were approved as we were very familiar with this particular operation i calmly tried to inform him that the principal always had additional items for the plane etc nope nope everythings on the plane they just need the candidate ummmm ok i think it may be wise nope sterile area not authorized stay out im in charge here ok buddy youve got it with a big ass smile i had really had it with this guy at this point i could see the hole he was digging for himself and felt our team had done all we could to avoid the coming problems so sure enough the motorcade arrives carssuvs luggage boxes of promo stuff and other crap this is where we would usually be standing by to unload the cars and get everything on the belt loaders and into the cargo holds as we werent there the folks in the cars just dumped it all on the ramp realizing that nothing was happening the protective detail now starts grabbing the stuff and trying to figure out how to get it on the plane meanwhile of us were just standing there in our glass line office watching smiling loving it right about then saic richard cranium starts losing his mind not only did his guys have to try and load the plane he was now realizing that the plane still had equipment all over it he rushes into the building and starts getting on one of our csrs about how were messing him up and he can see us all standing around with our thumbs up our butts finally i walk out to the desk and calmly yet somewhat patronizingly ask him what the problem is and ask if i can help him guy is literally foaming at the mouth and starts going off about the bags and the trucks and the equipment and why are we all standing around at that point i smile politely and remind him that he had personally restricted the ramp and ordered my staff out of the area of course i am here to help him and if he wants to reconsider his prior position i was confident that i could find some staff to finish loading the aircraft and remove the equipment so that they could depart he just glared at me and said do it two minutes later the plane is secure the equipment is gone and plane is spooling up have a nice day buh bye
so i was in my s and had a good group of friends we alwasy hung out at one guys house on weekends his dad was rich and had a epic party house there about to people there every weekend one asshat started showing up friend of a friend kinda deal well the guy he always came with moved away but asshat kept coming over on weekends he was a fast drunk and turned insulting and mean to people he didnt know that well and always rude to the girls that where there we got tired of him fast and when he got drunk he would sleep in his car till the morning at least he didnt drive drunk to get rid of him one night my friends and i decided on a plan asshat came over on sat like normal drank and got rude with in a few hours like normal went to sleep in his car like normal but this time when he was sleeping in his car we disconnected the battery from the car and taped black plastic tarp over all the windows i left about midnight but i heard the next morning he was screaming in his car for about min till he figured how to get out in pitch black asshat even called the cops to report my friends cops came and they told cops what they did cops laughed and said there was nothing they could do never saw asshat again
what do you do when the person making everyones life a misery at a company is the general manager who reports directly to the owners very little is the actual answer even here in the uk where we have pretty good employment laws everyone becomes so afraid of losing their job that noone speaks out this guy is the sort to come out onto the floor and shout directly into your face if he has some problem with you a little man who came over from india with nothing but a suitcase and an incredible attitude his parents live in india in a house with servants so i suspect he has seen power in action he believed that british men were lazy and didnt want to work he passed down edicts like noone is allowed to talk about anything except business unless it is break time i saw him shout at a young girl once she was a single mother he was shouting that the only reason he didnt fire her was because the child had no father to support it that kind of bullshit everywhere on a daily basis my revenge im not sure whether this is pro or petty revenge but it felt good at the time the handle to his office was one of those round ones just a ball of metal on nightshift i blew ink from two biros onto a piece of card and rubbed it on the underside of his door handlegave it a nice coating of thick blue pen ink i wasnt there to see it next morning but he unlocked his door and put his keys back in the pocket of his nice cream sports jacket ink all down the side panel man he blew a gasket that day and because he didnt initially know where the ink had come from he managed to get more of it on his shirt once he took his jacket off everyone was talking about it for daysalthough i never could take the credit at the time
so just a quick one from my dastardly friends archives of revenge same guy as rprorevengecommentsisnlufishsauceforfuckwits oh the stories i can tell so my friend is all dressed up and ready for a night at the club predrinks at the pub have been done and the whole group is feeling super happy and looking forward to a night of dancing and more everyone gets to the club usual cue and wait to get in they let the girls go in first together and the the guys go to follow one of the bouncers decides that my friend is too drunk to go in and even though all the girls and the other guys that just went in in front of him were fine he cant go in so its too late and everyone else has already paid to get in and hes left in the cold out in the street not taking a kicking lying down my friend devises a plan he heads around the back of the club down the alleyway and jumps the fence into the back area it is closed up and dark but he soon finds what hes looking for using a bit of wood lying around he smashes the lock handle of the electricity breaker box and opens it up then he turned off all of the power switches for the whole building in seconds he said the screaming that came from inside the club was insane quickly he jumped the fence and headed back down the alley to the front of the club by this time people are streaming out and he milled around with them until he met up with his friends they headed off for a different club and had a great time i dont know if he told the people he was with what he did that night but it really wouldnt surprise me if he never said a word 
i worked at a diner for my first job as a fountain guy meaning i whipped up and served malts shakes pies cakes etc i worked with desserts basically it was definitely a sweet gig for my first job one beautiful spring day i am invited to the birthday party of a girl i know this girl was particularly special to me because we were basically in that stage that comes before a relationship you know like where both of you know that youre going to date soon so you can imagine that going to her birthday party was important to me her and i are still together by the way the problem with going to her birthday party is that i worked that day i started asking about for a coworker to cover my shift no one that worked there regularly could cover it for me however my manager informs me of one guy who might be able to cover my shift well call him douche douche doesnt work at the diner anymore but he still covers shifts when he is able comes in maybe three or four times a year i call up douche who is my last hope at this point and ask him to cover my shift because ive got my girlfriends birthday party to attend he says hell do it and i was thrilled fast forward to the day of my girlfriends party and douche sends me a text saying he cant make it because he spontaneously developed strep on the day of im suspicious so i call him and ask him to tell me whats up he lied he was too high to go into work douche then asks me to tell the managers for him oh sure douche no problem thanks for being honest man i went to my girlfriends birthday party anyway douche knew he had a commitment and decided to get high regardless so he deserves whatever he gets for being that moronic not only that but he calls me on the day of my prior engagement and expects me to drop everything because he couldnt resist the urge to roll a blunt i threw him to the sharks managers happily he lost his notreallyaparttimejob i was pleased tldr asked a guy to cover my shift for work to go to my girlfriends birthday calls me saying he is too high to go on the day of i get him fired from his uber parttime job

first of all i do not know how appropriate this story is but i want to share it with you there was this guy from primary school who was a total jerk to me right from the moment we first met he would make stupid jokes and comments about everything remember i was or so even the most dumb shit can used as an insult i was a shy boy and had trouble becoming friends with others but i had a few and this jerk would tell lies in order to disrupt our friendship and since he was one of the top students maybe even the best my teacher wouldnt believe me anyway after we graduated from primary school we both ended up in the same class of the same highschool for me it was like a new chapter since there were some people i already knew and was friends with and i decided to stop being lazy and my grades became better jerk couldnt stop mocking me or trying to break my friendships well his tactics were less effective since i knew then and was prepared also i got used to be a little bit of a loner one day i had the idea how fight him back i could hit him since i was stronger but that did not seem to be the right thing for me we got our math exams back and i had a slightly better grade than him and i could see his anger in his eyes he couldnt believeaccept that it was me who was better than him so i decided to get better in every class i even got of or of but thats a different story and finally in the th grade i accomplished my goal i became the best student puff my class which till then always was jerk my friends congratulated me and our teacher gave me an ice cream in class a magnum and i had the permission to eat it in class he never ever brought any present before nor after it was like the cherry on top of your cream that he brought the ice cream at that day jerk was furious he also cried a little maybe due to his anger the others mocked him for crying after that he never ever did anything again he was broken he let himself go socially and in school he hardly made his graduation later he became addicted to drugs and lives a life as a scumbag who wasted his potentials and i realised that i lost my archenemy and that somehow i owe him something since he is the reason i started to learn harder than i used to i wrote this on my mobile so i apologize for possible autocorrect failures tldr became better in school than my bully and it crushed him
im a uni student me and six others live in this house together when we moved in we bought a fridge off the previous tenants apparently some group bought it six years ago or so and each year the new tenants simply paid to them to keep the fridge since it doesnt belong to the estate agents its been done exactly the same for years or so our year is very nearly up this sunday and we showed the new tenants around a week or so ago apparently they flat out refused to pay up for the fridge said fridge is very large and easily doubles the space for food and with people its pretty much necessary its a fair bet they welsh lads stereotypical dicks you met in school are expecting to get it for free since none of us can just take it with us i do not intend to let them have this pleasure why here and not pettyrevenge i dont want petty revenge i want absolute full revenge that denies them a free fridge not to just leave it all filthy in part because i doubt theyll care my current plan is to simply break the plug some how cut the power cable in half or just snap off the plug prong things opinions ideas best plan gets used only rule is it cant be overly visible like i cant leave the fridge full of rotten food yes its technically our property we paid for it and the estate agents told us its none of their business at the start of the year but still im hesitant to just ram it with cheese and leave for fear that they might keep some deposit though i am tempted to just drag it out onto the back road or to a tip or something

i fronted them their half of rent while pay got switched over and he asked me to wipe his computer for him im a geek because he said he wanted to donate it and scrub tax etc info off it before turns out fucker was hiding in a different province having been found guilty awaiting sentencing and to be clear this wasnt accidental year olds in browser caches he traded thousands of images and videos of year olds getting raped i found out several days after he left when my friend h who ill mention later on who said they would be good roommates fessed up and seeing how his fucked up girlfriend was on disability for epilepsy and didnt have another income any longer shit got really sketchy weird desperate and being nice but only in order to be manipulative because she had no possible way of making next months rent let alone paying me back and that required another victim to move in to pay the rent i moved my expensive stuff out of the house and she started acting funny so i started video recording everything she ended up calling the cops on me to try and get me fucked on assault charges i went outside with my laptop with the recordings waited for the cops and showed them the video ended up ok but that could have gone profoundly badly but i wasnt on the lease stupidly so the cops suggested strongly i leave so i did police never charged her for a false complaint which was unfortunate after moving i reported them for welfare fraud he got a cheque a few days before heading to prison she cashed it after he was in letters with photos to the food bank she was collecting food for a family and scamming the system all the social service agencies and shelters in town sex offenders in province go through an assessment period that determines treatment or hard time jail so i wrote up a letter talking about how he violated the restrictions of his presentencing release along with copies of bills lists of aliases her talking about wanting kids with him noted how she said she was putting a little extra into care packages and how they were screwing with prison phones to get additional time letting them know he had a gun in the home etc found the arresting officer judge crown and sent letters to them along with the citys ice and pd i wasnt able to figure out which jail he went to there is a bit of bumping around the system when you first go in typically so i sent letters to the wardens of all the possibilities as well he was hopeful that he would get the treatment program in a place without fences he ended up doing hard time as this got to the classification committee i also wrote letters to various inmates on prison penpal sites letting people know who he was but im pretty sure that never made it past the censors she was evicted had a ban on visiting for a while presumably and had her truck where she was supposed to live repoed not my doing just her not paying the bank pretty sure they broke up but she went into the shelter system and created stole identity after identity and i wasnt able to track her i feel kind of bad about it but i dont think i should should have cut off the power as well but i didnt because i was an idiot and ended up paying like months worth had to pay that off recently when it showed on my credit report he got out years after his sentence was supposed to have been completed tried to start a kickstarter for a cleaning company i ensured it failed and today i found a video of him using a shitty alias he took his maternal grandfathers first name and made it his last shooting guns and being a douchebag and sent it to the same folks above i ended up living with my friend h for months until her girlfriend m went apeshit on me after her piece of shit son stole from me and i called the police and decided to do an illegal eviction with one of her friends literally breaking down a wall to get into my room when my friend refused to give her the key to my room and tossing my shit outside as it was snowing and then calling the cops and mhes on me repeatedly saying that i was going to kill myself in an effort to get me committed and ensure that my things would be destroyed by the weather they also called my parents wtf this was a few days after i came out to my dad as being trans and while this didnt out me it wasnt great either as its one thing to have the talk and the other to see my whole wardrobe on a lawn it also reinforced his bigotry towards queer people and would later bring up this incident over and over h and m split up within a week or two and another friend of mine j showed up a week later and wondered wtf h and j hooked up and got married a few years back although i could never trust h again and that relationship ended even though she did hold that key from her partner and clearly put her relationship at risk doing so i just couldnt forgive especially as i only found out about what she did months after it had happened im broken shrug m fell into some really deep alcoholism and fell off the map added me years later on facebook and tried to apologize i never responded didnt do anything to her probably should have i learned not to associate with human garbage i spent years profoundly depressed full of self loathing wanting to die and attempting suicide a bunch of times never fuck with someone who has spent decades in hell because were used to it and we can drag you down and just sit there and smile while holding onto you as you desperately try to claw at the fucking walls to escape that said its been a decade and continuing feels kind of sick certainly not rewarding more routine this will probably be the last time

okay this isnt my revenge this is my dads background my dad works as some higher up project manager for a water company hes worked in a couple of places all water related from general now down to smaller companies started in the council big water company which hires smaller companies which hire smaller companies to do their work etc etc right now hes in the nd tier so to speak what that basically means is because hes worked in the higher tiers hes got connections and is desirable friends hire people they know etc etc hes a big name the set up in his new role hes working on a contract his old company set hiring another company to help fill the works load capability gap this is why this revenge works they just started work with this newly hired company started last week the boss of that company team is a man by the name of andrew something ill just use smith for this story anyway andrew smith needs to suck up to my dad because the success of his company relies on getting more jobs andrew smiths workers arent that many theyve all been put forward to my dad names pictures and all they also have company utes pickups with their company name on the side the scenario my dad was driving on a saturday with my mum and cousins one cousin is about years old to the markets theres a three lane road which merges to a two my dad is driving in the middle lane where the left lane merges in well up comes this ute driving in excess of the speed limit by a large margin as my dad tells it undertaking my dad illegal and dangerous and cutting him up as the lane ends well my dad is none too pleased opening his window giving the ute driver a piece of his mind how dangerous what hes done is how stupid it was etc etc well mr ute is not in the wrong so he thinks giving out the insults of his own how he can do what he wants and where my dad can shove it etc well here it gets interesting my dad recognizes the driver now hes atleast an hours drive from work my dad drives an hour every day to work and the work site near his house and this construction worker is also atleast an hours drive away from where they would normally meet what are the odds right well anyway my dad recognizes the company name too hes got to be the guy so my dad starts shouting do you know andrew smith do you know andrew smith over and over again this guy seems completely oblivious to what my dad is saying while he tries to override it with his own insults they drive on and part ways it seems like the ute is also going to the markets but changes his mind the start of mr utes end before they walk from the car to the markets my dad has called andrew smith on a saturday left a message explaining the situation if this is how dangerous he acts on the road i cant expect him to act safely on my worksite etc etc with the end if you dont call me back dont bother coming to work on monday boom thats a huge source of revenue lost for a company because of one guy cutting up a random on the road and words can spread in a close industry very quickly well not minutes later my dad has an email from andrew smith health and safety very important to us yadda yadda yadda we take this very seriously yadda yaddda yadda will definitely look into it i wish i could have been there when mr ute got the call did you cut up someone just now in a company ute no well my boss the project manager for our new contract said you just cut him up well i mightve got into an arguement with some guy but oh for fucks sake etc etc the chewing out wouldve been glorious the aftermath monday morning andrew smith is in my dads office apologizing on his knees mr ute is not going to be seen this week got to keep his head down for a while hes a good worker but he needs to learn the effect of his actions etc etc handed a reprimand does it again hes out etc etc well hes on my dads radar now as someone to make life hell for before midday my dad has a personal email from mr ute apologizing profusely for what he did how he was going to drop his wife off to her broken down car or some equal cop out how hes very sorry and how it doesnt reflect on his work ethic all this grovelling goodness after telling the story at the dinner table my dad said well youve gotta take the victories dont you tldr guy cuts up dad guys boss just started working for dad dad recognized guy calls guys boss on a saturday threatens to drop business guys walking into work on monday with a puckered arsehole a significant hit to the pride and a serious wrist slap that you wouldnt want following you around
i used to have a friend who was a bit of a klepto he bought a shotgun sold it to a friend stole it back and sold it to another friend he broke into peoples houses shoplifted and lifted stuff at parties we met in high school became friends and even though i knew him i trusted him he was two timing these two girls one of them had a new roomie named bruiser names have been altered to protect the guilty one day bruisers duffel bag disappears bruiser was relatively new to town he had some kids hed lost when he split with his ex in his duffel bag he had all of his pictures of his children all of his money his clothes and his gun he was enraged and hurt at the theft bruiser and his friends suspected everyone he did everything he could think of to have his property returned he accused and threatened his room mate hope chased kids out of parties it was a huge deal for him hope moved back east some innocent kids lost all of their friends bruiser never caught on that my friend mason had stolen his bag mason didnt get along with his father a convicted rapist who was married to a mcdonalds manager he was getting kicked out all of the time one weekend my parents were out of town they told me not to have anyone over and i invited mason in the months that followed that weekend it became clear that things were missing from my house my headphones were gone as well as my dads cellphone etc it took longer than it should have for me to put and together while my parents suspected that i had stolen from them i started to realize the extent of the missing items their size hmmm mason was kicked out again and found refuge at a friends house the brothers mick and dick we had all been close friends for a long time but they jumped immediately to the correct conclusion when their rent money vanished mason was kicked out they were pissed he was denying it i didnt believe it could be him we still hung out but tensions ran high one night following this recent theft a party was happening and we were all going to go we were all at mick and dicks house mason too waiting for them to finally break free of crowd inertia and begin to move in the direction of this party we had too many people for one car so i brought mason on my bike he requested we stop by the parking lot where his car was parked so he could change in the parking lot mick gets into an argument with one of the passengers of his car it was taking a while so i drove off for the party with mason after he changed that night masons car was broken into everything he owned was taken from that car he blamed mick and dick they denied it a few months later one of my friends confessed to me that they had stolen masons stuff the realized they had made the right call when they found some of their missing things in with his possessions that is when i realized that mason had no boundaries he had done the same thing to my family friendships ended over these events and mason disappeared from our lives mick and dick did not find their rent money but they had no doubt who had taken it they had their revenge i had not had mine after much thought i decided what to do bruiser had been in town for years now he had developed into a fine upstanding thug whom virtually nobody in their right mind would cross he was in a gang not the high school type he had jobstopper ink all over and was well known one day i ran into bruiser i had called hope back east and let her know that mason had stolen bruisers bag she was grateful for the closure but forgave him bruiser was grateful for the closure as well remorseful for innocents hed hurt and curious what masons last name was i was as helpful as i could be little by little the stories started to come to me they had chased him out of a couple eateries he worked at he lost those jobs because he was too scared to return i dont know what all happened to mason but i do know paybacks a bitch
im a pacifist i have never truly been in a fight and i tend to deal with most situations by compromising and talking to the other party rarely do i get personal or take things personally but there was one kid this one fucking kid who i actually let a grudge fester against nevermind the fact that he pissed all over my collection of magic cards while we were drinking or the granolahead demeanor he always had about him despite the fact he was also one of the most bigoted people i know who just happened to always wear bob marley gear and tyedye clothing while preaching peace and love but being a rich scumbag nevermind the fact that he tried hooking up with my ex the day he heard we broke up all my hatred for this dude culminated into a vengeance plot over a simple facebook conversation the whole background is much too tedious to explain in full his status made an obscure joke someone said they didnt get it and i replied to that dude using what i thought was a funny context to draw the joke in granola head went off on me for this but really in the end what inspired my hatred to reach its zenith was when he called me a retard a word im very sensitive with as a person who has lived his life with a developmental disorder and worked very hard to become a functioning human being its only the word retard when used in the context to belittle a person that i get upset sometimes at the time i was pursuing an education in chemistry which i later dropped in lieu of other interests so i had access to acids and other basic chemicals now if you do a lot of drugs you might have heard of certain reagents you can use to test for mdma like the marquis reagent reagents like these dont just turn a single color in the presence of a single compound i made some marquis myself using a ratio of formaldehyde and concentrated sulfuric acid i made about liters of it and in the middle of the night i traveled up the dirt road to his house parking at the bottom and dumped it all over his car not knowing if it would even do anything at all i dont know whats in those paints and waxes but whatever it was got fucked up he worked at a local pizza shop downtown and behind it was his car his car went from a dark metallic black to a bright orangepink
alright so i was in th grade when this happened and everyone in th grade gets a locker this being middle school everyone was an immature douchebag there was one prevalent pair of kids in particular who picked on people including me i was the smart kid during this time making me a prime target for the dubious duo ill call them e and w e was shorter than me maybe and w was about e thought he was the coolest guy in school and claims to do ohsomany drugs as a way to improve his street cred w is a big guy but is basically a follower he cant really exist independently from other people and is essentially around to hit stuff e and w used to be my friends in fact during the beginning of the school year but they turned out pretty bad what they did to me was called the locker slam every day after school got out all the classes rush like a herd of bison towards the lockers to grab their stuff and gtfo as soon as possible on most days the callous couple would come up to me while i was staring at the wall and my locker and slam it closed forcing me to manually reenter the combination this was annoying and tiring for me but i put up with it almost half the year before i snapped i am not a violent man i dont like hurting people however on this particular occasion i completely lost all my inhibitions regarding violence as they decide to step up their bullying scheme and take it up a level heres what went down im getting my books out of my locker and have my head partially inside when the bullying bunch come up onto me i dont hear them as the locker door shields me from most sounds not behind or to the left of me e shoves me forward and steps back allowing w to slam the locker shut on my exposed head by this point the hallway has mostly cleared and there are no teachers present to witness this there are a couple kids however the door smashes into me with the force of an thgrade giants arms and i fall inwards they burst out laughing i lie in there for about seconds and then come back to my senses such as they were i stand up spitting out blood having bit my cheek and look e square in the eye he goes white i punch him in the balls and he doubles over ill deal with him later i turn to w he already has his massive fist drawn back and is ready to show me twelve colors of pain i dodge the stupidly predictable punch duck down com up again after he withdraws his fist and kick him in the stomach he gasps some of his breath driven out and i take the opportunity to bring him down with my body weight he lands on his back and i give him the good ol curbstomp into the stomach again and kick his nuts for good measure w curls up and i eye e again as hes still doubled over stop right now or i will destroy your balls he shakily nods i walk out the door and go home feeling like i had just triumphed over the gods and then the adrenaline wore off and i realized what i had just done to them i instantly felt terrible i didnt apologize to e or w i also didnt want to and so lose face and the protection i had just gained by beating the pulp out of them by the end of the year we reached a sort of mutual agreement to forget it all and the next year we were great friends it worked out great for us because neither of us could go snitch with a teacher without getting in trouble ourselves tldr the pungent pest and his bulking bruiser are decidedly decimated by an audacious assailant
this happened a few years ago on my first trip to british colombia my brother and i rented a mustang for our trip up to see whistler in the mountains if any of you remember the sea to sky highway when it was basically a mountain highway with two lanes winding around up and downvery slow if you have an rv in front of you lugging up the mountainjust waiting for a passing lane to open up i was years old in a mustang with my brother on vacation were having a blast leading a group of maybe a dozen cars with the top down im leading at about kmh over the limit being mindful of the roads all the cars are leaving gaps and were peaceful my brother first alerted me to this ahole suv driver pulling insane blind passes and hearing other drivers honk hes cutting people off in corners to squeeze back into formation to avoid accidents im feeling the frustration of other drivers were all moving along peacefully with space when someone has to come along and ruin it i notice now hes about three cars behind me when i hatch the plan i decide once hes behind me hell stay there as ill just gas up right after each apex to toy with him a bit and i eventually did a passing lane in kmat this point i havent seen any police on the roads and thought ill have a little fun for the other drivers amusement and of course my own each time he would nudge out to pass id just gas up and give myself bus lengthshell catch upnext corner do it all over again hes throwing up his armsgiving me the fingerriding my bummerpassing lane in kmi created a noticeable gap going into the passing lane get over to the right lane doing kmh over the limit with cruise control on at about the m mark left of the passing lane converging over i see him flying up easily twice the limit and i was going to just slow down and allow him to pass meim checking my blind spot thinking why hasnt he passed me yet when i notice a police officer on the other side of the road crossed the highway to point him off ahole got a massive speeding ticket i surmise i was high on life after that two other drivers that probably fell victim to his stupidity gave me a thumbs up once we were in whistler tldr fuck with other drivers on the road in a dangerous mannersomeone will fuck with you ahole gets the attention of police i get two thumbs up from other drivers who witnessed what went down

this is something i did in th grade i had a friend scott who was one grade older than me we were friends through most of elementary and jr high but when we got to high school and i was a freshman and he was a sophomore he decided to start picking on me we had a math class together that required us to keep a folder for extra credit we could choose one homework assignment and one quiz every week to put in the folder the teacher then based how much extra credit we got by the grades of the assignments you put in the folder one day about week before grades were due i pretended i was putting assignments in my folder but really i took scotts folder and emptied it the next week our teacher asked scott why his folder was empty scott couldnt figure it out and spent all class looking for the missing assignments i started to feel bad cuz he looked like he wanted to cry he had already failed the class last year and really needed the extra credit to pass this year i was torn between feeling bad and trying not to laugh and give myself away eventually our teacher told him to stop looking and learn to be responsible he had to work his ass off the rest of the semester to pass i wonder what became of himhe wanted to be a cop
please dont kill me but i was wondering what and why the division is between rpettyrevenge and rprorevenge is there some awesome backstory im missing out on
during my freshman year of middle school i got the nickname loki after the god of tricks in norse mythology and exactly how i got the name i will explain now at the beginning of the year i was a loner no friends absolutely no social life i got bullied a fair amount but then there was this kidwho we shall call george who was the definition of a jock no intelligence good at sports needs nerds to do homework for him because he couldnt comprehend math he started to pick on me and throughout months it turned to bullying this continued for another months when i have had enough i go home one day furious and decide that im going to take this bastard down i realized i wasnt strong enough to fight directly but if i could pull it off i could fight him indirectly so for days it was the weekend i began to plan i cut holes into my jacket to act as compartments dont really remember what i built though by the end i had created the perfect trickster suit so on monday i put on my jacket and leave for the bus and sure enough the bastard awaits me he goes into grab me but i was prepared i quickly brought my pinky to my palm which released a set of marbles on the floor and then i slowly walked back the bastard slips and falls but gets up quickly and charges for me so i quickly start running and i feel something on my right arm a toy spider smiling i turn around and throw it at him he freaks out and begins to run and then slips on the marbles and smashes his head against the sidewalk he lived okay maybe the perfect suit was a lie it was mostly filled with stuff like marbles toy bugs some glue and a water gun but to year old me it was fcking perfect tldr i brought down bully using marbles and a toy spider

many many moons ago i used to live in a small town in north carolina i was in the fourth grade just as happy as can be i was a generally quiet kid and got along well with pretty much everyone i was the quintessential good kid that everyone loved one day while playing soccer at recess one of the kids shoved me down kicked me in my stomach then kicked the ball now this kid was barely a stranger to me i dont remember ever talking with him let alone having any issues with him nor him me i think in my clouded memory of longpast he may have been in a different grade so when he did this besides being physically hurt i was confused as to why someone would to such a thing to me on purpose after a visit to the nurses office and going back home nothing came of this situation for a couple weeks well one day i was sitting outside with my girlfriend aww young love waiting for my oldest sister to pick me up i dont remember why we werent riding home on the buses this day but it doesnt really matter as me and my girlfriend you always remember your first love right were just sitting there talking that same kid from before approaches us and starts calling us names and at one point called my girlfriend a whore now i was a pretty sheltered kid at this time and some of those names were foreign to me but my sense of honor demanded that i stand up for my girlfriend i never cared if someone called me names even at that age so i started off running after the little scamp well he was quite a bit faster and more nimble than i was and so easily evaded all my attempts to do whatever my young mind was going to do to him after a while he eventually got tired of running around me and waited for me only to kick me as hard as he could in my groin again back to the nurses office with a phone call to my parents about what had happened etc etc but to my knowledge nothing happened to that kid closer to the end of the year we were out playing soccer again and i saw that same kid well this time i wasnt going to just let him be i waited until he had the ball and then instead of kicking it to get it away from him kicked him in the knee hard somehow and to the best of my knowledge my girlfriend was the only one who saw it i never got in trouble and i never saw him again either i like to think that i might have broken his kneeleg
my brother has been unfaithful for eight out of years of his marriage possibly more he has also been reckless with his debts raking in nearly which our parents had to pay to bail him out he only had one son who was epileptic and disabled all his life and died a couple years ago in his teens after the latest and hopefully the last bailout in october last year we discovered his incessant infidelity which led to his wife leaving his house to crash at my other brothers place until she could figure out how to be independent again the police was also brought into the picture by getting him and the mistress to appear in front of someone of authority to deter them to stop engaging in this adultery yeah thats something we do in our country when the homewrecker finally made the appearance she proudly roared are you threatening me to us as if nothing was morally dubious about their relationship whatsoever later mr moneyman here apologized and swore he would be a totally different man and begged for the wife to come back she refused meanwhile he lost his job dads business fired him and thus was unable to afford the house dads business allowance he moved in with our parents and i was tasked to help him i foolishly took pity thinking that he misses his wife and would do everything to get her back i couldnt have been more wrong he continued to deceive us that he had cut all contact with the mistress when in fact he was still adamant on paying her grocery phone and scores of other expenses i then set up a nice fat keylogger on the pc he was using promptly took over his and her facebook and gmail accounts spammed her naked pictures to of her favorites friends along with extended proof of their thousands of dollars worth escapades while my sisterinlaw was taking care of his disabled child at home i then took over her icloud account and proceeded to brick the iphone plus my brother had so affectionately gifted her she did manage to recover her email address but i had completely disassociated her facebook and icloud accounts from it facebook was then deleted they are still together

back story many years a worked in a care facility and had the opportunity to do the ait administrator in training program with the small company it was a year long paid program where i kept my regular accounting job with them at the same time at the end of the program i thought i would be given a facility of my own with them but one of the head cheeses big cheese senior vp of the company didnt like me i found out it was because the lady i was working under had tried to become an administrator and had failed the national exam times and complained to big cheese about me many times for bogus stuff i was fired a month after i received my administraors license and big cheese that didnt like me said hemingway will never be an administrator for usshortly afterwards i was offered a great job with another company at a really good salary i also got a month severance package because i wrote a letter to the company president and told him that as a licensed administrator in that small state i would like to be able to say positive things about his small company they had about nursing homes i worked for the new company for about years running a wellregarded facility we had great outcomes great reviews and made good money i had a good friend that continued to work for the other company and he would occasionally mention in meetings with the head cheeses how well i was doing my revenge i was lured away to another state by another company with a large salary offer but it was a crap company and i put the word out with recruiters and others that i was looking lo and behold i get called by the president of my old company that they would like to interview me for an administrors position at their premier rehab facility so i agreed to the interview and had them fly me almost miles rent me a car i picked a new mustang put me up in a nice hotel for nights for the interview i take advantage of that by visiting relatives putting tons of miles on the rental going skiing great resorts in that area and had a great time did the interview and they offer me the job i tell them i would think about it i went home and accepted another offer that i knew was coming one that i was going to take anyway and didnt bother to call them back with my decision about weeks later i get a call from the president the one that gave me the severance asking about when i wanted to start work i said well you know i would love to but several years ago big cheese said that i would never be an administrator for your compnay and i guess he was right and i hung up it was sweet that company has since broken up
this happened around when i worked for a computer company that decided to start offering web hosting since the project was one of the top initiatives of our ceo he took a very keen interest in how his pet project was going and was very responsive when anyone emailed him about any and all difficulties while thats usually a good thing to do for customer service its often not so great for the poor sales guy that gets that one customer that has issues with everything so on to the story i was working in my cube farm when i got a call from a cheery young lady looking to propel her boss company into the information age and was looking to see what we could do to help her out m me cg cheerful girl for now m hi this is joetheok how can i help you cg i need web hosting for my companys website and im not sure where to begin m youve come to the right place lets see what we can do to help so thats probably not the exact wording but i do always try to be helpful to my customers so thats the general gist of the start of the conversation we went on to talk about our facility how things work the pricing and a lot of other qampa in all it took about minutes to get everything sorted out and make her a happy camper when we ended the call this is called foreshadowing she said she needed to make a couple more calls and then give everything to her boss but i should hear from her in a day or so fast forward a couple of days and i hadnt heard from her so i figured id give her a call and find out if she was ready to go i actually got her on the first call rare for sales and at that point well just call her pg for pissy girl because nothing that came out of her mouth during this conversation was nearly as pleasant as our initial call at first i thought id actually gotten her evil twin but then came to the conclusion that this was in fact the same person just on a different frequency apparently after calling us she called a competitor who proceeded to tell her all sorts of fictitious information which she spewed upon me pg i spoke to your competitor and he told me a ton of lies i dont remember what all she said but i think he got our name right other than that it was pretty much all false m lttries to debunk said liesgt pg he said youd try to say that but i know better i guess his lies were prettier than my truth no idea i have a very pleasant phone voice i guess his was just better m im sorry you feel that way but id be happy to go over everything and make sure you have a clear picture of what youre getting from both companies and clear up any misunderstandings if i can pg ltnothing vulgar was said but nothing complimentary at this point either i believe she did cast some aspersions upon my truthfulness and perhaps my parentage at this point we were pretty much donegt m if theres anything we can do for you please let me know pg ltclickgt about minutes later i get an email in my box from the harridan that i had been copied on i also realized that it was directed to my ceo who i was certain was going to read it it contained a litany of my sins my shortfalls my lack of ability to tell the truth and quite possibly my severe lack of hygiene none of which was true especially the stinky part i didnt realize how fast our ceo would read that but by the time i was through reading this sternly worded missive my manager was popping out of his cubbyhole like he been shot from a gun he got an email my director got one and both of them wanted to know what the hell i was doing fortunately i had a great rep on the floor and a couple of awards for being a customer advocate so i wasnt hoisted up on a stake to serve as an example for the rest of the staff it did however take a bit of telling the tale and swearing on an unopened copy of microsoft windows to convince them that i wasnt even half as horrible as i was portrayed in this work of fiction now the revenge part upon arriving to work that morning i got a lovely piece of spam in my mailbox all i had to do to get all of the loveliest filthiest hardcore porn delivered to me daily was just give them my email address since this was before the canned spam act there wasnt any of that pesky validation thing so with just a couple of clicks of a mouse i made sure she was fully informed on every variation of every sexual position and fetish anyone could send her for free even what a bargain not only had she emailed me from her corporate address she even copied her home email so she could keep a copy of the dressing down she gave me presumably so she could cheer herself up by reading it when she couldnt find anybody in the office to have fired not wanting her to miss out on her education into the ways of the world if she wasnt at work i added that address too im not exactly what transpired at that point but knowing the wild west of porn spam at that time i always rest assured that her email boxes were defiled and defiled and then defiled some more because once they had an address even an act of god wouldnt get you off of it 

throwaway for obvious reasons so we had this kid lets call him fuckhead cause he is staying in our home for months rent free my roommate who owns the house has a really big heart and i also think likes drama and so has these boys stay over to get back up on their feet well most of them fuck off and dont get jobs or even try sometimes are rude take food that isnt theirs etc but i digress my roommate has a big heart so he kinda lets people walk on him so fuckhead we were pretty sure was stealing prescription pills from my roommates mother she is like a walking corpse and needs her medication so it had gotten to the point where we were tired of giving him chances and kicked him out last i had seen of him i was told he shouldnt be around i threatened to get my gun because i assumed he was trespassing well last weekend for some reason my roommate let fuckhead stay the night because i guess he had no where to go on the terms that he left early well he was hanging out longer than needed but eventually left then i find out one of my roommates other couch kids caught fuckhead in roomies room straight up taking change and money out of his jar and acted like he didnt even do it then tuesday night about mins after my bf goes to work i hear the fence next to my room banging around i assumed it was a dog trying to get out we had one that would escape all the time so i open my curtain and there is fuckhead looking straight at me breaking into our yard to steal stuff i wasnt thinking i just wanted to get him and so ran in the the house to the backyard but i think he hopped back over the fence and ran off i yelled to my roomie in the shed out back its like the trailer park boys ppl live here we have ppl everywhere if she had a friend upstairs cause sometimes theyll hop the fence to visit her i told her fuckhead was in our yard and to grab her bat i go downstairs and inform the other couch kid to grab his bat and we search the block for him yelling that if we see his face were gonna smash it so we lock everything up for the night and are on our toes if he tries to come back now wednesday night i go to work come home hang out pass out wake up the next day and my roomies are tellin me he was back last night and was in stuff one of our friends unaware of the situation had let him spent the night but had issues getting him to leave the next morning so my roomies went over with bats to get him out of the house then they noticed that he had stolen objects on him like headphones he had to bust into one of our cars for a cd he had to of gone through my shed roomies stuff for etc once i hear this i think oh no i had just got out of the shower and had to be to work at i run into my bus and check my drawer where i keep my savings gone i fell to the ground and started bawling i was so angry i knew i should have locked my stuff up better after seeing him trying to break into our stuff i run inside and tell everyone what he did but the guy is a dumbass they found an ad he posted on cl he even took a picture it was taken in the house of the friend they went and kicked him out of hes looking for a girl so my roommate messages him and talks to him pretending to be a girl and to meet himher in the park i had to go to work upset that was all of my money well like i said we have ppl in our house or of them went and they all stood at the exits in groups of two the girls even walked up right behind him and waited while he sat on the bench waiting for the girl that was never going to come my bf is a scary looking guy tattoos and piercings on his face strong big exmilitary has guns knows how to use them etc he was a fucking retard to even go into our bus and steal from us so hes sitting there i guess and then he sees my bf coming at him from across the park so he goes to get up and run but the girls are behind him they both just push him down and start punching him one of my newer roomates comes over now and picks him up and knocks him down again with a punch then picks him up at this point my bf is running at him and just takes a flying punch at his face knocking him on the ground again at this point he is on the ground crying like a bitch while getting boots in his face finally my roomie who owns the house gets there and is kneeling on top of him screaming into his face how fucking stupid he is for stealing from us when we let him into our home the whole time while my bf is grabbing his head and shaking him and yelling at him for fucking with his gf then one of the girls says he has a knife in his pocket my bf grabs it and throws it away to disarm him we did everything legal no weapons only a misdemeanor could be givin for kicking the shit out of him but what is he gonna say oh i got the shit kicked out of me because i was stealing from these people multiple times then my bf notices that is his knife that was in the same drawer as my money also keep in mind this kid is trying to say he didnt take anything from us when we have caught him red handed and he also had the stuff on him at this point people thought it was over for him they thought my bf was going to kill him but my bf didnt even pull the knife on him but im sure the kid almost pissed his pants thinking he was about to die they emptied his pockets and while they are taking stuff he has the nerve to be like hey thats mine he only had in his wallet and my bfs like mine now at first we took his nice phone and bus pass but my bf said to show a little compassion and gave it back we told him to get the fuck out of town or we wont hold back next time my bf wanted to cut his clothes off and make him walk around naked but that would be illegal he got boots to the facehe cried like a bitch i dont think he will ever mess with us again i only got of my money and he bought some fucking spice fake weed and salvia with my money i recognized the price tags they were from a porn store across the street from the house i took the salvia i smoke it sometimes but yeafuck that guy
well looking at all the bullies stories over reddit the past few days reminded me of some stuff i did myself in th grade or so around that time i was somewhat underweight and the st one in my class to get specs my parents made me wear that sting for the extra geeky look as well now some people did not like me for wearing them they really did not like me for wearing them it was usually verbal but guys got physical when i kept ignoring their verbal taunts why do schools recommend ignorance instead of revenge god knows anyways they had been randomly pushing me around pulling my chair awayetc for a few days well it was time to get even even though i did not look too strong i had enough to muster up a few strong punches and shoves but i couldnt take on of them so i needed to get them down by dealt with one by skipping a pe period stealing some stuff from the teachers desk and a few of the students the teacher loved and stuffing it into this guys bag wellwhen class started a search happened and that got rid of this guy for a few days didnt have a plan for the nd one but i had some sort of an exhibition coming up soon where the school principal would have been present provoked this guy about min beore she turned up kept him off me barely him him hard once to get him pissed and as soon as he started retaliating i got all limp as if i had been beaten badly thats when she walked in as well the consequences of that were fun to watch it kicked off a series of events that led to the guy being held back a year in th grade 
back in the early s i went on a camping trip with a bunch of friends and a younger friend of a friend had invited his high school buddies who were a bunch of belligerent jocks that night around the campfire the jocks are exceedingly drunk and fighting each other occasionally and making a hell of a mess the next morning my friends and i were up earlier than them and collected all the trash into bags when they woke up we asked them if theyd be willing to take just one bag with them to dispose of it most of it was cans from their pisswater theyd brought they laughed and said they didnt give a fuck and they werent taking any trash while they were distracted we put all the bags of trash in their trunk as the little bit of camping stuff they has was still in their back seat perhaps not the most satisfying revenge but they probably had quite a stench in the car after a week or so 
my history teacher told me this story a week or two ago i dont know if this is true or what the final outcome was but we can all hope so as we all know driving drunk is very dangerous for the driver and anyone around them the driver of one car was drunk probably over the speed limit by an absurd amount etc as is essentially cliche at this point she hit another person surviving while the sober driver died soon after she was caught and arrested i dont know the legal system et cetera so i may be wrong with some of the stuff in this paragraph when she was brought to court she settled out by being required to keep a picture of the guy she killed in her wallet to be checked by her probation officer every meeting the picture the mother of the dead guy chose a picture that would force the woman to remember what she has done for the rest of her life a picture of the guy in his coffin tldr drunk driver kills someone and must carry the picture of him in his coffin for the rest of their life to anyone who think this isnt a kind of pro revenge think of how it would affect you mentally to be reminded daily that its your fault that someones son and possible father andor husband was killed when it was avoidable

 this happened a couple of years ago in the area i live in its not uncommon to see amercan flags in front of businesses especially car dealerships its also common here to see the amercian flag hung alongside mexican flags and ive even seen it buried in a whole array of flags from south america while its great for a car dealership to display their pride in multiculturalism i feel displaying our flag this way degrades its importance so on my way to work one day i was delighted to see a car dealership that had american flags clipped to every car and hanging on the fence in front were two larger flags and not a foreign flag to be seen it was a mom and pop place with a dirt parking lot with a trailer office in the back and about or used cars on the lot ill call the owner dealership guy dg my excitement was misplaced because as over the next few weeks i would drive by and sometimes either one or both of the larger flags had come off of the poles and were lying on the ground or had been pushed down on the poles so that they were flying half mast or at the bottom of the poles but they were usually fixed rather quickly so i just blew it off one morning i was driving by with my wife and as usual my eyes went to the flags and i shouted why is that flag hanging upside down my wife told me to calm down and either email or call them when i get to work and ask them to fix it when i got to work i found the dealerships website and an email address to which i sent the following email from redactedvoice to dealershipguy sent thursday july am subject flag what is the problem with the american flags in front of your business everytime ive passed by your office this week the flags are either on the ground or hanging upside down as a veteran who has made sacrifices for his country i find this lack of respect for a symbol of those sacrifices made by me and many others offensive this lack of attention to detail reflects on you and your business and i will never buy from someone who cannot pay attetion to something as simple as proper respect for our national flag and will even go to great lengths to ensure that my friends and aquaintences do not shop there either thank you rv i attached a copy of the flag etiquette code with the parts underlined that deals with the flag touching the ground flying at half mast and being hung upside down a little while later i got the following reply from dealershipguy to redactedvoice sent thursday july pm subject re flag i will rather ignore or no respond to your comment i am not the wind that blew it off dg to which i replied from redactedvoice to dealershipguy sent thursday july pm subject re flag are you the wind who hung it back upside down not once but at least twice this week if the wind keeps blowing them off please secure so that they cant come loose a piece of wire a couple of screws or some duct tape should do the trick rv when i didnt get reply and i figured the guy was probably just embarrassed and would go out an fix it right away so no big deal but on the way home i saw the the flag was still upside down the next day i stopped on my way home and took being very careful to say on the easement ouside of the business and not to touch the flag as that could be seen as trespassing and possibly get me thrown in jail over the next couple of days i talked to the local police emailed the local vfw and american legion i more or less learned that its within his right to display the flags in whatever manner he wants no matter how offensive it may be that started me thinking he may have the right to mistreat the flag and hang it upside down but i have the right to call attention to it as loudly as i can his website didnt have a comment section or one of those rating meters so that was out it was hosted on one of those places that lets you set up your own website for free so the closest i could get to his website was to create my own i created a web page called dealership guy motors is unamerican i posted the pictures of the flags with a story about what was going on and i set up a counter of the number of days that the flag remained upside down and a daily blog to update the story that went something like drove by there this morning flag still upside down drove by this evening flag still upside down the other one is at half mast days and still no reply from dealership guy then i went to every forum i could think of that was appropriate and posted dealershipguy motors is unamerican with the story and pictures of the flags i emailed the local radio stations and tv stations to top it off i joined a couple of online biker groups and posted in therethose guys love their flag after waiting a couple of days i did a google search and sure enough all of those posts my website and a few cross posts popped up at the very top of the search a search on yahoo gave me the same results i took screenshots of the search pages and sent them to dealership guy i included the urls of the google and yahoo search pages and the url of my web page i personalized it with a very sweet have a nice day after several days of silence and being ignored i got a reply within minutes i could bore you with a whole tale about implied physical threats and threats of a lawsuit or how the local media came this close to getting involved but to make a long story short he took the flags down completely immediately after i sent him the email not exactly what i wanted but no flag at all is better than a mistreated one

back when i was i got a job working at a breakfast restaurant i didnt really like it compared to my summer job but i wanted to make money during the school year so my choices are limited my boss paid me below minimum wage but the bus boys would get a very small percentage of the waiterss tips after that i would usually end up getting paid around an hour but i always felt it was kind of cheesy because the waiters would make at least in tips and because i knew my boss was quite well off because he drove a nice car his son drove a nice car and his daughter that i went to school with drove a nice car now the money that would compensate for my wage was called tip share and i would pick up the previous days tip share after each shift at first i would always get paid what my tip share was or rounded to the next dollar as time went on though things got more screwy our boss started pinching pennies where ever he could and i got yelled at once because i was throwing away still wrapped straws that were still on the table ok fine these straws literally cost less than a penny each and its more trouble that its worth to save them but whatever i did it anyways because i was told to i then noticed that i would get shorted a few cents on my tip share though for example if my tip share was i would only get this started to bug me for obvious reasons but i didnt say anything about it it got worse though one day my tip share was something like and i only got i then said my tip share is but then the manager giving me my tip share quickly walked out of the room while saying oh sorry i dont have cents after that even if the tip share was a few cents short i would stick it to them and make them pay it the first time i did this to my boss he made me feel like i was begging for change this went back and forth until i eventually got sick of it and quit i felt so defeated and hopeless thats when i discovered tripadvisorcom though for those of you who dont know trip advisor is a website that is open for anyone to leave a review on a restaurant attraction etc this restaurant i worked for was in the top ten out of restaurant in my city so you could say it was pretty highly rated this is where my revenge starts to take shape i realize that creating an account and posting one bad review with my new account will accomplish nothing i needed a reputation or reputations i created different accounts and i started to slowly building up reputations with these different accounts i made fake reviews some good some bad i only did bad reviews on other places where the general consensus was that they sucked and it took me a year or two to make everything seem normal and i varied the amount of reviews each account made by this time my boss had actually expanded and had a second restaurant in a different location of the same name i wrecked havoc on both of them leaving around star reviews on each restaurant after i did this more star reviews started showing up that i didnt even write the newest restaurant that my boss opened up ended up closing down and out of curiosity i went by the restaurant that was still open in a sunday morning the restaurant was a breakfast place so sunday morning was the busiest day of the week because everyone would go out to eat after church it was nearly dead i counted cars in the parking lot i dont think ive ever felt more satisfied in my whole life

to start off i dont consider revenge a suitable form of action and a more suitable resolution should always be attempted first if not a few times but at some point revenge is morally right or more fun your choice so heres my story a few years ago in college i managed to get my first internship for engineering i wont say where i was hired but it was a manufacturing plant of a sort needless to say i was quite green to the field and young but excited several interns were hired but my position was different while all the other interns were put in the engineering offices i was put in a small office on the floor with some seasoned supervisors none of whom where even in my field before you read on please note that i ended my rotation on a great note i had saved the company thousands more a year than it cost to have me there implemented a new product procedure stunned management at my presentations and even left with an informal job offer i was essentially thrown to the dogs to learn processes that no one in the plant knew all the steps to and i had days to learn them from the past intern all while trying to attend mandated toursmeetingsetc i ended up writing a page paper on how to perform that one duty due to all this mess i managed to get myself put into the engineering office but i had missed all the getting to know you events with the engineers due to my responsibilities getting back on track my supervisor was a young guy who started as an engineering intern and after graduation went through a fast track program to become the department supervisor now in comes becky name changed my manager had informed me to ignore her requests and has been in obvious confrontations with her but he out ranked her and for most arguments was typically in the right she hated him remember the responsibilities i mentioned earlier well they required me an intern mind you to light a fire under the engineers butts to get them to push paperwork through this created a mild animosity from the engineering department towards my intern position and me especially from becky who was notorious to the floor supervisors for not only being a jerk but never doing her paperwork she was also notorious for talking behind peoples backs etc etc i was given a new engineering supervisor and when my new desk was placed in her area she immediately assumed that i was there to do her work and that she could make me miserable during the first few weeks i had no issues helping her out and learning as much as i could i frequently asked her if she needed help but then it became abusive im not sure if it was that i had to pester her to do her job when i had my old responsibilities or that i didnt take peoples sh when they just wanted to sh on someone or that she had a bad relationship with my supervisor who outranked her either way she started talking behind my back to the other interns when i wasnt there i was informed that she would get off the phone with me when i was on the floor doing her job and tilt her head back exclaiming out loud how i dont do any work she would talk down to me and treat me like i was stupid simply because i would ask her how she wanted me to do the tasks she requested i was given a many tasks that were performed by other interns and were strait forward but once completed she would yell at me for not doing them how she wanted i was given many tasks with no instructions or a lack of important details just so she could complain that i was doing things wrong doing her job wrong the breaking point was when i had a month left of my rotation another intern left a month early so that she could secretly start a different internship she claimed she went to summer school the desk i was given in the engineering department was so tiny that i had to use spare tables in other rooms to keep all my work in order so i requested to take the other interns large desk and my supervisor approved after watching me run around the building after i had clocked out to get all my things on the new desk and have everything set up becky didnt say a word the next day i came in to an email from her telling me i was out of line to move my things without her consent mind you she had no authority over me and was one of engineers in the office and told me to move my things back i went to my supervisor and asked what the issue was but becky had already yelled numerous lies about my desk migration and i was forced back to what people had dubbed the lonely island that very same day becky had the gull to bring me to her desk and explain she had was in charge of a new product and that i needed to come in hours early for the rest of my rotation to over see its manufacturing and record its data she stressed its importance for her and that this was my way of making things up to her i had my opening i agreed and started coming in early but missing my data points at first i didnt directly mess up her data but i didnt try very hard either eventually some of her prototypes got lost in a mess of literally thousands of others due to the floormen not paying attention i sure as hell didnt check the logs to find them then the last week i was there i over heard her hyping up her new product how great it was and how shes really been helping batmanssecret learn what engineering really is and she took me under her wing when in reality she hadnt talked to me for weeks at this point all my data went missing the backup file was corrupt and after she presented my presentation as her own she was swiftly taken to the head of engineerings office and much noise ensued i apologize if this was long and wordy but i still left out many many details of the backhanded things she did to me another one off the top of my mind is that she invited all the interns except for me to many after work gatherings and even talked about it in front of me 
when i was in senior year of high school there wasnt much to do in my area so me and my indian friend would go play minigolf it was fun and passed the time so anyway one time we were playing and we got to the hole you had to hit a ball up the hill i hated that hole because you rarely hit it with the right amount of force so i hit my ball and it starts going up when it reaches the top of the hill a freak of nature happens and it somehow goes flying right up in the air wha immediately i hear behind me an angry hey i turn around and see a middle age guy stomping towards me from the other side of the course what the hell are you doing youre gonna hurt somebody chill out man it was an accident no it wasnt you two are being freaking idiots and are gonna hurt someone i look over at my friend a scrawny yr old kid who couldnt do shit if he tried and me a kid who literally just tapped a minigolf ball up the hill we looked at each other questioning if this was really happening and if this guy was serious you idiots stop messing around and dont hurl your balls in the air he starts stomping off but i didnt mean to he looks back at me stomping off with rage face turns out he was just playing with his kid my friend and i go to the next hole hey mc the dudes glaring at you just ignore him we played the hole next hole i saw he was doing it again i had enough and knew he was fucked if he laid a hand on me so i waved at him and yelled with a smile how you doing the guy ragefaced in shock the problem was my friend did that to him everytime we got to a new hole i told him to stop but i stopped caring at the second to last hole rageface finally responded good and stomped back up to us and stood right next to me as i putted i began to purposefully miss my ball and knock it into the wall next to him oops i did it around times and finally sunk it when he finally walked away i looked at my indian friend and told him alright the gauntlet is thrown follow my lead keep your shades on and no matter what happens dont fucking laugh that friend was a real racist i stopped hanging out with him because of it but i used it to his advantage i should mention this was the spring after we went to the cashier and talked to the manager with my most pathetic soft voice i began to tell her what happened to my friend and i how the guy approached us and yelled how he harassed us and how he targeted my friend you know we come here to have a safe fun time and this guythis guy was so racist hehe called my friend an fing arab my friends face immediately turned red trying to contain his laughter i could tell his eyes were bulging behind his shades i mean look at him hes clearly embarrassed and turning red hes not even arab hes indian and he blamed him for the manager looked crushed boys im gonna talk to him right now wait here no look we had enough today well come back another time we dont want him to yell at us anymore we left the building and i told my friend dont laugh till we got in my car the split second before he closed his car door we heard rageface yell what and we lost it we drove off into the sunset victorious tldr dude fucked with my minigolf i called him racist hilarity ensued
so i was heading home from university early in the morning after am summer class not a nice morning driver the main road to the university that is normally packed during the school year is under construction which meant lanes became for a good miles to and from the university as i head into the merge i see that some chick in a suv was trying to cut me off but i supposedly had the right of way cause the front of my car was in front of hers and i was in the merged lane this continues for like mile because this merge was quite long and i try to maintain being in front of her she without warning starts to merge left onto my lane with me there knowing that i was there so i had no choice but to go into the center lane left turning lane until this dumb bitch passed me and i could merge back in i had a smaller car so she would have won the fight kicker is when i merged back in she flipped me the finger and shit was going to go down because i felt i was being generous to not have our sides fucked up as we passed the construction and the road went back into lanes she immediately goes back to the middle lane and i gunned it passed her and cut her off as close as possible as soon as my front tires overtook the front of her car since i was driving faster than her i then slammed on my brakes all the way to mph flipped her off as i felt triumphant i started to accelerate but wasnt really ready to let her off just yet she switched lanes again thinking this is over and that civility would restore wrong i did it again now she honks at me and tries to escape by switching lanes again wrong third times a charm now she is probably freaked out me as well because normally i would leave it at flipping them off as a drove past freaking blood rush she pulls into the nearest parking lot on the right and i go on my merry way feeling quite accomplished again i acknowledge that i have road rage issues tldr some chick forces me into the middle left turning lane in a construction merge point and has the audacity to flip me off triple revenge back to back dont fuck with me on the road
technically its not my first revenge but the first i can remember myself everyone knows how little kids are amused by the crowd of adults kids show off make silly things etc it wasnt my case i was always interested in adults because of the things they were talking about which i didnt understand and what they were able to do which i couldnt my brother had a group of friends which occasionally were hanging out in his room id always just wanted to sit and observe i remember guys touching their girlfriends kissing etc all this behavior i couldnt wrap my head around another example was one of the guys who could spin the basketball on his finger actually i still dont know how to do it all of this was just amazing kind of like a different world sometimes my brother was letting me sit there and usually they were making fun of me i was the only one who wasnt laughing since i didnt know what they are laughing about they were asking me things like pierce tell us what is vagina vagina i asked and they burst out laughing or they were asking me to tell them a joke and i was telling them a joke i heard from someone my age and they were just rolling over not because the joke was any funny but because of the situation and they way i was telling it one day my brother brought his friends and i stand near his room looking at everyone like a little creep one of the guys a musician brought his new girlfriend i was in love i had to get to that room to be able to stair at her but they closed the door i knocked i asked i begged nothing my brother went to the kitchen to heat up some water and that was my moment i sneaked in jumped under the table and settled comfortably my brother came and started dragging me out so i hold to a table leg didnt help they were smoking cigarettes that why they didnt want me there i even didnt care i just wanted to stare at that girl unfortunately the musician couldnt hold on to his girlfriend so it was the only time i saw her i went to the kitchen and i poured about cups of salt to the kettle my brother made coffee for a few people and soon enough they figured somethings wrong he went again warned me that if i do this again i will regret cleaned the kettle and started making the water again a week back i got prescription from a doctor because i hadnt pooped for almost a week none of the over the counter stuff worked so he prescribed something serious it sure cleaned my bowel pretty damn good i spent whole day glued to a toilet i found the pills crushed them with this saw my mom using it and poured to the water again well i took pill and i poured all of them to water probably left so imagine for someone without the problem all people who were drinking coffee including my brother next day were dying their symptoms were colon blows runs flu dump my brother himself sounded more like a machine gun i hadnt told that to my brother for over years until yesterday we had such a blast during the dinner i almost peed good old times tldrolder brother gets punished by providing him and his friends a diarrhea of their life and he doesnt know about if for over years
well reddit this all happened a couple of years ago before electricdog quit drinking well drunk electricdog was quite the fellow he was rude crude and a petty revenge kind of guy one day young electricdog came in to work and was presented some samples of barbecue sauce for the upcoming beerfest at the local event centre well electricdog popped the first sample into his mouth and it was a delicious chipotle barbecue sauce now before i continue a spry young fellow with a fondness for pranking people and being a general douche had started a few weeks earlier everyone called him by his last name spears electricdog called him britney electricdog did not like his douchebaggery in the least bit in fact electricdog was averse to his tomfoolery that he began to break a little inside each time he was forced into a social situation with britney anyways enough backstory the second sample was supposed to be another barbecue sauce but this one was supposed to be the milder of the two in fact the cooks specifically britney had been concocting this contrivance since the first blush of the suns rays were reflected off the door to the basement bar he worked in when electricdog put the sample in his mouth for a second it tasted quite nice a spicy barbecue sauce heavy tones of something all together not unfamiliar to our hero then the capsaicin spiciness was an old beloved of electricdog but this was unlike anything our friend had ever experienced it was flooding his nostrils and tear ducts his every ounce of being began to ignite with the devils secretion he had just ingested the entire kitchen as well as the bartender and britney at the helm of the whole ordeal the bartender informed our standardbearer that britney and the rest of the cooks had gotten their hands on some ghost pepper and made it into a paste of a sauce that was to be used on drunk people ordering suicide wings the bartender hardly able to contain his laughter thrust a litre container of milk into electricdogs hands and so he imbibed the moo juice at an incredible rate almost finishing the container then a moment passed electricdog was dancing around with flames pouring out of his oral cavity suddenly the urge to purge came upon our exemplar and he sprinted for the water closet at first there was relief but soon after that electricdog realized that the vileness that was within should be kept there and processed for it scorched the same if not more coming up so our hero was forced to withhold the contents of his stomach from the almighty porcelain god but something inside him was broken something that would eat at him until vengeance had been brought to pass upon the evil britney weeks passed electricdog biding his time until such an event would present itself where retribution would be swift and deadly he remembered an old klingon proverb revenge is a dish best served cold one day while sitting at the oaken counter after consuming just the right amount of grog britney sat down beside electricdog electricdog ordered another beer trying to ignore his most hated of enemies then something unexpected happened britney threw a looniecanadian one dollar into electricdogs beer and promptly left his drink unattended at the bar to head to the washroom electricdog saw his chance it was time to put up or shut up he grabbed britneys beer firmly with his left hand unzipped his fly with his right hand and pulled his cockandballs out and swished them around the full container making sure to get just the right amount of taint juice around the brim of the glass britney returned from the bathroom and drank his fresh pint of beer none the wiser then electricdog exacted his revenge he waited until britney got up and left the counter and told the loud mouthed bartender on the other side of the counter what had just transpired now all electricdog had to do was wait wait for the story to circulate a couple of days later britney was on duty and could not even look electricdog in the eye he knew he had been bested there would be no more question as to who was the bigger dog a few days later britney terminated his employ with the bar edit tldr got tricked into gobbling a piece of chicken with ghost pepper sauce so i tea bagged the guys beer while he was in the toilet

this story begins with a friend of mine being harassed by one his mutual relations we were all in high school at the time my friend his friend and myself mgainer it was mid summer around the time when you are at a loss for how to fill the long lazy days we did the usual stuff play video games play pick up sports ask me about batball smoke a lot of potwell one afternoon me and my friend lets call him jarry meet up to just chilloot he starts to tell me about the previous night however and how this friendfrom now on known as stew of his fucked up his car when he said his car was fucked up im like dood you drove here so obviously it wasnt so bad but he explained to me that during the previous night a girl he was tryna dig out wanted him to come over and hangout now jarry really isnt good with the girls which is no big dealio to me but this came as a surprise to him and myself mgainer was he finally gonna get laid nope stew let all the air out of his tires and smeared baby food mixed with what apparently had to be shit it was already after midnight and jarry didnt want to deal with his car so what was supposed to be just an annoying fuckol prank turned into cockblockery bam fastforward to a little later in the day and weve already concocted a brilliant scheme to get stew back we set out to go fishing sorry to you animal lovers about what happens next there is this great little stocked pond close to where we live so we decided to go there we brought a nice white five gallon bucket and a lid and some beerand pot for some reason on this particular day we couldnt miss with our hooks im talkin every other cast was just jerk n catch before long we had small pan fish in our bucket but we knew what we needed what would really send this scheme to the pro level and wouldnt you believe it on our next casts we each got one two fat n juicy carpyeah those dirty brown mud fucker fish we put those in the bucket too whoosh we were off to the store we grabbed a gallon of milk and a container of meat tenderizer that night we added the milk and meat tenderizer to the bucket already at this point if anyone got a full whiff of the contents of that bucket they woulda been hair back eyes out gagging we covered the bucket and put a couple cinder blocks on top to keep out the local wildlife but every couple of days for two weeks jarry went out and gave that bucket a good prod n stir with his pitchfork after that bucket had been stewing for two weeks we decided it was time to do the deed we geared up in elbow gloves black plastic trash bags and makeshift masks to dull the stench there was no way jarry was bringing that bucket in the car so i held that heavy bitch out the window all the three miles to stews house at am in our homemade hazmat suits we slipped like shadows onto stews driveway jarry climbed on top of his car and motioned for the bucket with a few momentous words he dumped the stewed contents all over the windshield and into the hood stew had suspicions yes but he never retaliated against jarry after that 
i belong to another forum in which i have spent way too much time on and its a website that analyzes and tries to be objective about whether or not ninjas can actually defy the laws of physics and if aikido practitioners can actually fight people then answer to both is no among other hilariously retarded claims made by several martial arts or artists im also the most successful and prolific instigator on the site having caused multiple ruptures in social structure and policy development by generally being as much of a calculated asshole as possible any member of this site will know who i am the owner of the site has once said to me in private you are the fuckwit that we need but not the one we deserve anyway there was a particularly annoying user who would constantly try to piss on anything i did i made it a point to be extra mean to him in the worst ways possible i would go beyond the call of duty to make sure that he would get the full extent of being as flabbergasted as possible i would use sentences such as this is why your mom left you in response to being called a faggot and a chink or id go into my bag of tricks and do things like send him a private message that had images takes from the mars rovers in full resolution now this might not mean much but at the time the forum didnt autoresize your images so theyd be displayed full bore on your screen this kid had a shitty computer and so such large images would crash his computer i figured out a way to get past the signature size limits on images as well so i would make nasa images my signature on every post to him so hed crash out anyway this back and forth would go on for about years or so until i made my way across the country to formally train with him we did some grappling in which i submitted him in hilariously amusinghumiliating ways wrist locks shin chokes rode him like a cowboy making yee haw noises while he struggled to get out from under me or just calling out my submissions a few moves before i would do them to be fair he wasnt very good at grappling as he said he said he was much better at kick boxing so he wanted to do that instead i agreed to the terms and we had minute rounds the video is lost somewhere but i have a single still from it wherein i collapse his liver at some point i punch him in the face so hard while sticking him in the corner that his head whips back and hits the camera i think i also broke his foot at some point i dont remember exactly when or where but he claims that i did ill take it i left pretty satisfied and he stopped being such a little piece of shit it was worth travelling miles and having built up the anticipation of kicking the shit out of him for roughly years 
 years ago i working as a barista for a horribly coffee well call super bean i had a number of petty while i was there but this is my only pro revenge the boss at super bean is a horrible micromanager theres a lot to keep track of so smaller things will get tasked to the lowly employees one being keeping inventory of coffee beans while the job wasnt the best the coffee is fantastic id never steal while i was working for the business but once i left that went out the window my buddy whos still working there has been throwing me about a pound of my favourite coffee every weeks since i left just a few shy of lbs of coffee beans swiped to date
i was a kid so please dont judge for my actions as a kid i was a troublemaker i was everywhere and if something happened i was the first on the suspect list either it was making fire in a trash container tying something to neighbors dogs throwing small rocks in neighbors windows at night stealing fruits from their gardens putting mud on their cars and more i was chased many times by the neighbors and usually they couldnt catch me since i knew exactly where i can sneak thru where they wont however my parents were going crazy the story takes time when im i have been hanging out with jack the son the the current town clerk in a very small city the new election was coming up you also have to know that i come from a postcommunistic country as some of you may imagine something like todays russia predominantly peoples values and beliefs about how the things should be its not like in the story any more but still my country is in the ice age in some matters another day me and jack got caught us on stealing cherries near our residential block were many small gardens where most of the people had apple trees cherries grapes etc many people were making some goodies for the winter and everyone knew the best cherry tree in the whole area we sure knew too jack was a kind of a chicken and it took me some persuasion to make him go with me after all i was running faster we got caught and the owner took us to our parents no one was home at my place and the owner used to so much to what i was doing that he just warned me like th time this year jack on the other had got in some serious trouble besides beating the hell out of that kid the town clerk forbidden him to hang out with me and going outside i felt its unfair imo we didnt do any damage it was nothing to what i did in the past he still got punished like it was something big in the contrast i didnt have the dessert for what i did i felt that the responsibility of the revenge rests on my shoulders next day i went to pee on the town clerks door while im peeing the door opens im hiding my weenie and sure enough the town clerk just boils his mustache were kind of jumping and a huge vein appeared on his forehead he grabbed my ear before i was able to move it really hurt on my toes i was walking to my apartment no one is there we go back to his place and he told me to sit in his small toilet like some animal i supposed to wait for my parents i hear the town clerk and his wife arguing it was first time i saw that he is probably a monster at home i closed the door from the inside and i was holding to the lock so he wasnt able to open that with a screwdriver i told him i want to wait for my mom in the meantime when he was away from the door i took every single bottle of perfume etc tooth paste etc which were in the cabinet over the toilet and i poured everything to the toilet i was also flushing the toilet every time as it filled up to piss of mr clerk my mom got home and i made myself to cry i told that mr clerk wanted to beat me and i was scared etc all of that to not get in trouble with my mom she got pissed and took me home i was crying a long hour just to not get beaten by my mom now i was even more determined for the revenge one day i was looking at some photos there were a few pictures from the vacation with my parents and the town clerk and his wife on one of the pictures the clerk was with my father the town clerk was holding his hand on my dads stomach and both were laughing probably drunk as fuck just fyi they were wearing which is still normal for straight people in my country lol i took the picture and cut out my fathers head found an envelope and got my neighbor friend involved who was about years older since i wasnt very good with writing yet we wrote a letter which said that the town clerk is a gay and we attached the proof being a gay in postcommunistic country could mean literally death by people who like trouble or even police believe it or not thats truth for sure it would be extreme comparing to these days the least when proven would be elimination from the society even family btw the short swimming shorts doesnt mean in slavic countries that youre gay so i went to the post office and i say i want to send the letter to the towns clerk office there is nothing on the envelope a very nice lady was laughing at me since it totally looked like i dont know what im doing she didnt know the address but she was kind enough to make a call and write it for me on the envelope she asked me what is my name and being surprised by that question i gave a name of my friend from school so now she said dollars example i was like what money i dont have money and how much well now i had to get money somehow i got home and asked my mom for money she asked me why and i lied i want to send a letter to santa claus she was surprised by that but she gave me the money i run back to the post office and its closed i will have to wait until monday then it was really really hard to not spend this money but the mission was more important the letter was sent i dont know what i was expecting but probably something like they will arrest mr town clerk and he will spend years in a jail well nothing happened until the town clerk didnt win the new election a few years later i heard a story when he was starting again for a new election that a few years back someone accused him of some homosexual acts and it bent his reputation accusation in the office was enough to start the rumor around the small town since the letter was addressed to the clerks office not directly to him im guessing someone opened it before he did as a kid i didnt really think that sending the letter directly to him would not cause any damage still i think it was clever during the new election some kids sprayed in some places in town mr clerk is gay it wasnt me for everyone it was obvious that the last name was the clerks name he won that election however years after when i look at it it really tested his reputation all the good things he did for the city didnt matter maybe he was a bad person at home but people were saying he was a good town clerk i was never asked about the picture so i guess he either havent seen it which i doubt or he didnt want to let to know my parents if he even was able to recognize and remember the timeplace the photo was taken since the incident when he closed me in his restroom our parents werent hanging out any more i saw him occasionally on something which is celebrated as namesake it doesnt exist in the us in my country its just another reason to get wasted
when i was years old it snowed in texas for the first time since i was born i was down the street having fun enjoying myself when one of these bullies that was about compacted snow into ice and threw it at my face it hurt like hell and i started crying since i was so mad so i went back to my house made a snow ball and peed in it i used a hat to carry it in didnt pee in the hat lol i went back to him and threw it right in his face
ill give you guys some back story in graduate school i met my girlfriend neha not real name the best way to describe her was she was the sweet innocent indian girl to everyone but she had a really slutty side that she hid from her parents and her indian social circle when we would start dating shed tell me that her parents expect her to get married soon that she could get married to a cardiologist lawyer etc shed talk about how she wouldnt have to work a day in her life i dont know if she was trying to make me jealous but i didnt give a shit funny thing about the whole matter is that these guys usually expected a chaste girl which neha was the furthest from when we started dating she told me it was just going to be a fling but over time i started developing serious feelings for her i told her and turns out she felt the same i wasnt a doctor but i had a good career ahead of myself i wanted to have a serious relationship and maybe one day marry her later in our relationship years in she told me she is going to go to florida with her friends to party see concerts as uneasy i felt about this i did my best not to come off jealous she promised to text me to make things easier for me and all and well she told she was going to see tiesto i was talking to my friends about it turns out tiesto was in europe when she came back i started confronting her with the inconsistencies and she started lying her ass off though she never admitted to cheating she started doing nice things for me to get me back at this point i was thinking fuck her and move on but i decided to milk it for what it was worth i used the whole cheating thing to have her on grade a behavior to add to that i used it to get a threesome after that i felt much less bitter but i couldnt ever see myself getting married to a girl that cheated on me she was a good girlfriend but i couldnt risk getting divorced to her later down the road and she takes all my money and since she still never admitted to cheating on me directly i didnt feel obligated to tell her that i wasnt interested in getting married by now we were together for years i was and she was her biological clock was ticking hard her parents at this point pretty much gave up on her getting married and her younger sister was already married and popped out her first kid we got into a big fight one day and in it i yelled at her to admit that she cheated and she finally did after all that time i dont know why but a huge weight just lifted off my heart that i had won and then i told her that we are over since then she has been begging me to reconsider for her reality hit her hard when it comes to traditional indian marriages a woman past no one is really interested in and sadly for her the effects of aging were already getting to her plus she was planning to lie to her future spouse about her sleeping around so i dont really feel bad for her anyways its not that she cant still land a guy she can still find a decent guy now but the idea of marrying a rich dude that will treat her like a virginal princess is over for her her life of not having to move a finger is gone now thats what you get for cheating lt conrad 
when i was years old i had my first job in a restaurant and i was so excited because obviously it was my first job i am years old now and openly gay but then i was obviously very shy and quiet and was quite the pushover so anyway one night this girl and her boyfriend came in and i had to serve them and any time i spoke to them they kept laughing at me you know when youre trying not to laugh at something with your friends but you make it really obvious thats basically how she was treating me all night long making me feel so insecure so anyway for the first and only time in my life i exacted revenge on her i had to make her dessert she had a lovely chocolate brownie with my saliva sticking it to the plate and some ice cream with also my saliva in it i exacted a little bit of revenge but i didnt really feel like i had done myself justice because her boyfriend and her continued to smirk even after she ate the dessert and i told the manager i will get revenge on that girl i promise you this he just laughed and told me to let it go well the gods most have been looking down on how this girl had treated me with her boyfriend making me feel so insecure in my own skin at because the next day after i had finished rowing me and my friends went into the supermarket right beside it and as i was walking along the tills i saw a familiar face and shouted no way at the top of my voice it was the girl from the night before she looked up and ive never seen the colour drain from someones face as quickly as hers i told my friends all about what happened and they quickly went and grabbed all their food and we went to her till we all started laughing and just making her feel as uncomfortable as possible after i paid my money and she gave me my receipt i looked her straight in the eye and said its not nice being intimidated in your own work place is it and she just hung her head in shame it was glorious a few years later i ended up in a amp e last month because i couldnt breathe and the doctors couldnt get an oxygen level i was sitting in the hospital room waiting for the nurse to come when the curtain was pulled back and i heard a now my name i looked up it was her her from the restaurant her from the supermarket having to care for me we both looked at each other like deer caught in the headlight we knew who we both were but we decided to say nothing she obviously made her little nurse chit chat like what i did and stuff and she was telling me about my diagnosis but i dont think ive seen a nurse take blood pressure as quickly and throw my medication at me before running for my life ive had a lot of revenge on people in my life some obviously not as effective i had to have counselling because i was bullied so much but i think this one was the best of the bunch
so i was always a lard and i moved from out of the area to this middle school it was already hella cliquey these two boys who were twin brothers made my life absolute hell called me every name in the book tried to start rumors about me the whole nine one of them was definitely worse than the other but theyd assist each other when they deemed it necessary i had fought back with my own comebacks but two against one is hardly fair it wasnt until i had a side job in college that i was able to exact my revenge i was in college and i worked as a tutor i had my stoner friend with me who was baked we drove around looking for somewhere that would satisfy his munchies when i saw a wendys sitting on the corner it was a saturday around am and i rolled up to the window an all too familiar voice asks with his stupid drawl this is wendys may ah take ya order i figured that this day was as good as any to exact my cosmic justice and i told him yes i will take orders of chicken nuggets instant panic took over the kitchen as they were dropping batches and batches of chicken my former primary bully tried to talk me out of the multiple small orders but i refused this is for a class function i lied then continued they need to be in individual packaging for all the students i went up to the window and paid noon struck while i was sitting there and all of a sudden vans started circling the parking lot and getting in line it was soccer practice day and all of the kids had just gotten out of their morning scrimmages i rolled up so that they could try and process the other orders to the best of their ability the bully himself walked up to my car holding several bags and stared slackjawed realizing what had happened thanks i chirped as i snagged the massive bags of chicken nuggets handed them to my stoner friend and drove off like a bat out of hell my stoner friend probably ate at least of those things we gave the rest to this woman that we knew was homeless so that she could have something filling for the evening it was a great day whenever my friend and i talk about it we call it operation clustercluck i told this story to my fiancee who insisted i needed to share this story with other people this seems a bit involved for the subreddit for petty revenge so i posted it here
not sure if this is prorevenge or pettyrevenge so im posting in both so i live in an apartment complex with extremely limited parking and no parking on the street for a good half mile one night i come home from doing a hour job to discover the parking space closest to my apt is open as i go to pull in i realize no its not open some inconsiderate tool has double parked so i gotta go park in the boonies i walk back and check his park tag they usually have the apt number on it his is faded off so ive no idea whose ass to kick i decided to go for the next best thing i grab a can of spray paint and paint douche across the side of his car in giant letters from window to the bottom of his doors i ran out of room for the e so it ended up across the windshield the next morning i woke up and the car was parked proper lesson learned added bonus lesson not learned i found out who he was later because id see him get up every morning for the next couple of weeks and check on his car to make sure no one messed with it meaning that he didnt think that someone sprayed his car because he was parked like a douche but because he thought someone was out to get him i guess his sleepless nights still make it totally worth it

okay so this story takes place back when i was an innocent year old girl dating my first real boyfriend who well call matt because that was his name so wed been dating for almost a year and naive young me was beginning to think this was the real deal ahh to be young and stupid however it was not to be one day feeling the urge to be the best girlfriend ever i baked matt some cookies mnm ones to be precise and decided to drive them over to his house in order to surprise him before i continue its important to understand how matts house was set out basically he lived in his parents twostorey house and they occupied the top level while he got the bottom level with a tv room bedroom and bathroom there were stairs at the front of his house leading to the front door on the second storey so he had his own personal entrance a door on the ground level into his living space so young me waltzes in with her freshly baked cookies only to find matt in bed fucking some random girl id never seen before needless to say i was heartbroken in the moment i could do nothing more than burst into tears and run back out into my car before driving away in the days that followed i slowly transitioned from hurt to angry and fairly soon i formulated a plan so one night late in the night me and my closest friend drove to matts house quietly parked outside and with the use of some craft glitter superglue and resentment we carefully enacted out our plan the next day matt woke up and walked outside to find the word cheater printed neatly in sparkly glittered letters superglued to his door and as an added bonus courtesy of my friend repeated on one side of the bmw he had just received from his parents mutual friends later showed me angry pictures posted by matt on social media and although the glue ran down the doors in some places it was still clearly legible fuck you matt 
xpost from rpettyrevenge as i have been called a scumbag for this one i feel no guilt rover was a dick and i hated him we worked together for a year and he talked down to me at every opportunity whatever his last day was a friday and he had a large suitcase for all of his acquired crap for his long train commute home one of the engineers walked into my office and invited me to the pub after work they were going to kidnap rover it turned out they hated him too the kidnap one of the engineers offered to give him a lift to the train station their car was at the front of a convoy instead of turning right to the station they took a left into the country rover could clearly be seen to get animated this is petty even though he was going to miss the last train home the driver was going to give him a lift half way to catch another appropriate train too soft but that was the only way he would agree to the gag obviously noone told rover this the sun was shining and we were sitting in the garden of a lovely country pub this revenge could well have turned into an accidental treat only it did not rover would not relax he got more and more abusive so much so his nice driver colleague took the large suitcase out of the car and told him to start walking so he did the last i ever saw of rover was him dragging his case over the top of a hill in glorious sunshine good riddance 
mods if this edges too far towards illegal ill understand if you remove it but i think this sub is the perfect place for this tale about fifteen years ago i had a buddy with whom i liked to go exploring abandoned buildings woods bridges construction sites you name it we didnt go damage or steal stuff just looked around in my neighborhood there was a long fronttoback narrow facing the street property sloping steadily upward from the street a new buyer uprooted five or six s ramblers from their foundations moved them in and stood them on stilts sort of expecting to build foundations beneath some vandals wrecked the lower ones they were hauled away and the one at the far topback was left the property was sold the houses had been placed on big wooden platforms held up by several crosshatched stacks of railroad ties we had our eyes on exploring the houses decided to leave the place alone for a while after the vandals hit then snuck in to check out the one remaining house the wooden deck stuck out from under it only on the back and the left side at the back left corner it was about five feet off the ground the stairwell in the middle opened to an foot drop open the front door and it was more like feet nice old s home not much of note but nice to go through especially considering the weird way it was stood there were no no trespassing signs we obeyed those where i live if youre caught in some such place and there are no signs all the police can really do is ask you to leave next door out by the street was a tiny house that always had tvs flickering in all the windows day or night a few months go by and my friend found himself homeless i had nowhere for him to crash but i stored his stuff for him he decided hed quietly move into that abandoned house arrive late leave early stay quiet and he assumed itd be fine he borrowed some old camping gear i had took the closet doors off their tracks and used them to cover the windows removed the glass bowl from the ceiling light and hung the camp lantern from it on a bungee cord and thus all was well for a month or two until someone had to be the little house next door neighbors behind couldnt see and neighbor on other side was never home spotted him and called the police they arrived asked him to vacate helped him move his stuff down to the ground and said he could return the next night to get it when we came back we found most of his stuff gone and what wasnt gone had been smashed to pieces the grass up there was very tall and very lush so youd really have to know something was there we could faintly see what looked like a path blazed up to the area from the little house he was livid the police had every right to trespass him but this was a dick move by the nearby neighbors we decided to have some fun and dug into my stash of fireworks im still surprised that everything worked exactly as wed intended but it did go off without a hitch one firework didnt go off but thats not much we snuck in from the rear through another yard set everything up left the same way went around the block hid across the street and waited first to go were some piccolo petes a shrill whistle followed by a bang lights went on in the little house next a string of firecrackers then some mortar shells no firing tube so they just leapt about feet off the deck and exploded the grass was green at that time of year no fire danger three people came out of the little house just in time to see the mortar shells of course ones first thought isnt elaborate timedelay firing when they saw a window on the left side glowing we were pretty sure they believed the squatter was back and shooting fireworks they got flashlights and trudged up the hill we had placed cigarettes on the fuses cut to various lengths they kept burning until they reached the fuses wed come up with this on the former th of july to throw together a short show we watched them haul themselves onto the deck at back left saw their lights appear in the picture window at far right as they entered the dining room behind and watched the lights appear in the front bedrooms the window on the side a frosted one was a bathroom between the toilet just beneath the window and the bathtub was a little wall with a towel rail onto which wed glued a row of candles the glow went out and they left the house surely knowing that theyd just wasted time and effort going after a guy whod arranged a bunch of stuff in order to make them do exactly that it wasnt long after that the final blow fell on a fencepost along the back of the property id placed a big singleshot white chrysanthemum mortar with a full cigarette on it id hoped they wouldnt notice it as they went in or came back out the firing tube was white and they didnt it went off just as they were regrouping and lit up the house and yard for a few moments id guess as bright as daylight we were pretty sure the message of youve been had was crystalclear a week or so later we snuck in through the back and left a twofoot roll of firecrackers on the deck with a full cigarette fur those who dont know if you light a firecracker string thats been rolled they set each other off and the result is a solid blast of noise wed unrolled about a foot of it so they got about five seconds of machinegun firecrackers followed by a deafening shhhhhhh at their house about feet away it must have been a real shocker after that we left the matter and the abandoned house was razed a few months later
ok so to start off i was in the military for about years and after you are done with basic training and your tech school you get you orders to your first base well when you are fresh out of basic and tech and not married you have to live in the dormitories on the base this happened around when you had to share your dorm room with a roommate and also share the toilet and shower with the the two people in the room next to yours i had the luck of having this little macho asshole as a pissmate thats what we called the people you shared the bathroom with he would brag constantly about all the girls he had slept with and even had what he called a victim book with xrated pics of all the girls hed slept with in all honesty this was none of my business until about a year later he was trying to get in the pants of a girl that i happened to be very good friends with she was an extremely nice girl and wanted nothing to do with one night stands i very politely warned her to watch out for this guy because thats all he wanted out of her about a week later on a saturday morning this idiot storms into my room while im still asleep and proceeds to attack me in my bed because my female friend turned down going out with him because of what i told her now he continued the whole time to try and punch and kick me while im still half asleep in bed i finally wake up enough to realize whats going on and throw the little prick across the room he starts to curse at me and tell me i better watch my back and keep my mouth shut so now im up and im thinking what kind of pussy attacks a dude while he is defenseless sleeping in bed i decide i should get up and get done i go jump in the shower remember we all have to share the shower and i see his slightly expensive shampoo sitting on the tub and a very gross idea for revenge pops into my head i decide to unscrew the cap to his shampoo and proceed to jerk off into it i shake it up pretty good as to mix up so to cut it short i made sure to compliment him on how nice and shiny his hair was and how his shampoo must have a lot of protein in it every time i saw him after that
when me and my friends were like y old we lived in a peaceful and nice neighbourhood all other people were nice except one old couple they were fed up with life and children we did skating and hanging at a bus stop near their house we were well behaving and not too loud kids but still they didnt like us they started to call police saying we were destroying things etc the nd time even the police were fed up with the wrong alarms one day they had broken beer bottles on the bus stop and said we did it we were too young back then y olds didnt drink to have drank those and we happened to notice that there were similar empty beer bottles on their yard they also had their adult son to drive our skating curbs away another friend saw this we had had enough we started to broke bottles on their yard shot bb pellets on windows blew up their post box many etc in the beginning it was quite frequent but of course fading as time went by still every now and then they got their post box blown up we actually gave them quite a lot more than they were asking but the thing is that they did ask for it they didnt need to be assholes in the beginning they didnt state a reason for hating us so today i dont know why they started it tldr old couple started to fuck with us and we gave them overly back
this is long but i think a little back story is important i went to a small private liberal arts allwomens college we lived in a bubble picture classes where most every sentence that comes out of someones mouth starts with the two words i feel so we had residence coordinators who were generally students who had graduated the year previous and were in exchange for free housing free classes and a small spending stipend housed with the students to keep order help in emergencies run house meetings wipe noses etc etc better than the traditional house mom but not by much in the bigger houses on campus there were triples on the first floor for first years my girlfriend and i managed to get it as a double her second year thus freeing up two singles so we had a living room bathroom and bedroom to ourselves essentially our own sqft apartment in a dorm house and our living room wall was up against the rcs living room wall this wouldnt have been a big deal if not for a few fun facts about our rc that year she was finishing up classes required for her masters degree program and was constantly studying she was very noise sensitive she was a petty little bitch fun facts about me and my girlfriend we never had classes before lunch because we were both night owls we always had a lot of friends over and parties every weekend we had two cats one of which hers was a siamese that never shut up and a dog same as most any other college pets were not allowed the dog was coowned with another friend so it sometimes lived with us and sometimes lived offcampus needless to say our pets were the worst kept secrets on campus my cat and the dog were brought to my tennis matches on leash and harness of course as well as rugby matches and walked around campus daily so she knew we had the pets but it wasnt until we annoyed her one too many times that she decided to make it her lifes mission to prove we had the pets thus getting us fined pet per month until pets were gone thanks to the fact it was a very liberal liberal arts college she could not just do a random room inspection she had to give us hours notice which gave us plenty of time to get the animals out of the room though one time we forgot and ended up hiding both cats in the window seats in the hallway between the living room and bedroom litter box was hidden in our bedroom closet we refused to turn the music down because the siamese wouldnt shut up the whole time he was in there after about room inspections in a month i was fed up she was being petty because we were noisy and though we did try to keep it down late at night we annoyed her no matter what time of day it was edit for clarity she was that girl in the dorm who told everyone to shut up shes studying someone walking down the fucking hall too loud got bitched at by her and she had a complete other room to study in that wasnt sharing a wall with us so i had no sympathy she complained to the girl above her that she was stomping around constantly and the girl who was very sensitive about her weight ended up moving out of our house very upset she wrote up of our house for noise violations that is why we wanted to get her to quit so i decided i would prank her until she quit or cried or quit while crying she had a car and a reserved parking spot right behind the house next to the handicap spot so one weekend i borrowed my dads truck rwd to tow a boat and too damn early for a monday morning backed up to her bumper it was a jetta until just touching and slowly pushed her car into the handicap spot she only used her car on the weekend so chances were she wouldnt notice the car was moved until it was too late monday she received a parking ticket tuesday she received a parking ticket wednesday she received a parking ticket thing is after three tickets your car is booted thursday her car was booted at this point public safety called her and told her to get her car out of the fucking handicap spot i was walking down the hall past her room and the door was open that evening and she was talking to some other housemates insisting i swear i put the parking brake on i dont know how it ended up in that spot one look from me and everyone knew who was responsible and that was just the beginning of months of horrible amp petty pranks i pulled on that poor woman in my quest to get her to quit
