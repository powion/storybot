 he came up to my register and started piling all of his selections in front of me but instead of the typical chips soda and candy bars he had mixed fruit cups strawberries and <unk> cream fresh fruit like apples and bananas and a box of apple <unk> i commented on his choices and he replied my <unk> said bring him <unk> <unk> so thats what im <unk> <unk> <unk> '' 
 i picked up the cereal and said man i <unk> had this stuff in years 
 now when i leave tonight im going to have to go buy a box to tear up 
 thanks a lot dude '' 
 he laughed and went on his way 
 a few minutes later i hear the <unk> from the gas pumps that <unk> a customer needs assistance 
 i pressed the button to ask what the matter was and a voice just says dont forget them apple <unk> '' 
 lol 
 edit - here you go guys 
 <unk> it up 
 <unk> did n't like my <unk> because i do n't have any proof to show this happened but it 's related to working in retail so i hope you all like it 
 years ago i was attending a local college learning computer repair and <unk> 
 a guy in my class who was known for being a <unk> worked part-time at a big box store that <unk> and sold computers 
 he came in one day <unk> about his new <unk> and how much faster his computer ran now 
 he was just dying to tell us how he 'd <unk> a different big box store and come out of it with a free <unk> 
 he told us how he 'd gone into the store and bought a brand new <unk> 
 he took it home installed it in his computer and put his old one back in the box 
 he then returned it to the store and got his money back claiming it was defective 
 of course this is clearly theft and it made all of us uncomfortable to hear about and the <unk> shook his head sadly at him 
 the next day he did n't show up for class 
 neither did he show up the second day 
 on the third day he came back and was raging mad that things were unfair 
 he told us he 'd taken the two days off to cool down because he was so angry at what had happened to him 
 it turns out that in addition to <unk> to us he 'd also <unk> to all his coworkers at the big box store 
 he thought they 'd love his story because he 'd done the stealing from a competitor 
 his boss was disgusted by his actions and phoned up the store he 'd ripped off and told them what he 'd done 
 he told them that the thief would be coming in and returning the real <unk> and gave them the guy 's full name and phone number in case he <unk> out on it 
 the <unk> was afraid of losing his job at this point so he manned up and took back what he 'd stolen 
 as soon as his boss had confirmation that things had been put right he fired the guy 
 i really like to think that the guy learned something from the whole ordeal but the way he was raging about how <unk> he 'd been treated i doubt it 
 tl dr bosses do n't like to hear they have a stupid thief working for <unk> here 's a quick one that just happened to me on my lunch break 
 went down the road to get a <unk> and decided to stop for <unk> i 'm putting the nozzle into the tank a mercedes pulls up behind me 
 we were the only two people at the pumps and i did n't think much of it at the time 
 after about 30 seconds the mercedes issues a short loud <unk> 
 ok maybe the driver leaned on the horn by accident while getting <unk> to step out into the cold 
 no big deal 
 10 seconds later 2 more <unk> in quick <unk> 
 ok ... <unk> 
 so i turn and look and the driver is waving me over to her 
 umm alright 
 so i <unk> on over and the drivers side window rolls down 
 inside is what i can only describe to be a <unk> from the real <unk> of nj 
 orange <unk> still glowing from her last session in a <unk> bed 
 lips are so inflated and puffed up i wonder if she either has had too many <unk> <unk> or if she 's perhaps dating <unk> brown 
 designer purse and sunglasses 
 the only thing missing would be a gucci dog carrier with a small <unk> inside 
 anyways the woman <unk> her hand full of money and tells me thirty dollars '' 
 at this point as i 've only gotten two hours of sleep i 'm still not <unk> what the fuck is truly going on here 
 my normally sharp <unk> is now moving at the same pace as <unk> <unk> running a marathon after her 3rd mile 
 me : i 'm sorry whats the problem 
 <unk> : i want $ 30 put into the tank 
 i decided at this time to look down at myself and make sure that i was in fact wearing my work uniform 
 and just as i suspected all along i am wearing dress pants shoes a white button down shirt and nice heavy sweater with a nice bright white <unk> on it that says <unk> company name <unk> on it 
 me : <unk> ma 'm i do n't work here 
 <unk> : what 
 you do n't 
 me : <unk> 
 see this right here 
 it says security 
 <unk> : well then wheres the <unk> 
 why is n't he pumping your gas 
 me : he 's inside i guess 
 and it 's not full service 
 <unk> : what 
 you mean i have to pump my own gas 
 me : well yes it 's self service 
 <unk> : well this is not how it is in nj 
 me : yea well this is not nj so do n't know what you were expecting 
 <unk> : where 's the nearest self serve station 
 me : far as i know about 4 towns north 
 <unk> : well ca n't you just pump my gas 
 me : uhhh ... no 
 <unk> : why not 
 at this point i just walked away 
 stupidity is <unk> and i do n't wan na catch a case of the <unk> 
 the <unk> clearly pissed off actually had to get out of her car 
 can you believe it 
 how dare i 
 she storms into the convenience store and starts berating the clerk 
 now at this point my gas is done pumping but much like a porno after you 've already finished i had to sit tight and watch the final shot 
 the clerk visibly confused is listening to this woman as she is pointing to me clearly yelling 
 the clerk stares at me <unk> a few times and turns back to the woman 
 i can see him shake his head 
 this obviously <unk> <unk> even further 
 i can see her ranting and raving and the clerk great guy that he is stands his ground and tells her she can either pump her own gas or go somewhere else 
 well <unk> comes out walks over to the gas pump and sits there 
 she obviously ca n't figure out how to work the damn thing 
 i walk in grab my receipt share a quick laugh with the cashier and walk back to my car 
 as i 'm walking over <unk> waves and says sweetie could you show me how to work this 
 be a doll '' 
 my laughter could be heard for miles from that one 
 i got back into my car put on jump by van <unk> and laughed my way back to work 
 **tl <unk> do i gas 
 ** **edit : for the last time i am fully aware that in nj it is illegal to pump your own gas 
 i used to have a house down at the <unk> 
 but it 's <unk> to assume that someone over the age of 35 has been outside of the state at least once in their <unk> year driving <unk> summer i worked at a small shoe boutique 
 there were only two employees : myself the assistant manager and the owner 
 usually only one of us would be manning the store at a time 
 i had a lot of eccentric customers but for the most part everyone was understanding and <unk> except one woman 
 as soon as she walked in i knew that she was going to be difficult 
 she marched through the entrance with her friend in tow and slammed a shopping bag onto my desk 
 try to <unk> an argument i ask how may i help you '' 
 she says my daughter bought these shoes from you and now they 're ruined '' 
 i am very confused at this point but ask to see what 's in the bag 
 she pulls out a shoe box that i recognize as a style we always carry and opens it to reveal the shoes and a receipt 
 the shoes are in fact ruined 
 the <unk> are completely scratched and there are lots of dirt marks and <unk> on the upper part 
 i look at the receipt and these shoes were purchased two years ago 
 confused i say what seems to be the problem '' 
 while these shoes are no longer <unk> it is obvious that it is due to normal wear and tear after regular use for two years 
 she scoffs and turns to her friend giving her a look that obviously means that she thinks i am incompetent 
 she says i told you already 
 my daughter bought these shoes and now they are ruined 
 i want a full <unk> or replacement '' 
 i calmly explain that that is n't possible as we do n't accept worn products but that i could check to see if her daughter 's size was in stock so she could purchase a replacement 
 she and her friend both start yelling at me saying that obviously these shoes should be replaced for free since they fell apart 
 at this point i 'm starting to get really annoyed so i say i 'm sorry but it is n't procedure at any shoe store i 've ever been to to replace merchandise that has been worn multiple times 
 i ca n't accept this return but like i said i would be happy to check to see if her size is here '' 
 at this she and her friend grumble to each other for a bit while i just stand there awkwardly 
 finally she turns to me and says you obviously are new here and do n't know what you 're doing 
 pass the message along to your boss and tell her to call me '' 
 she leaves the store leaving the shoes on the desk 
 luckily my boss came in an hour later to relieve me of my shift 
 i explain the situation to her and she was just as confused as i was 
 she calls the women and asks her what the problem is 
 after the woman explains it to her my boss simply says well i 'm glad she enjoyed the shoes 
 they look well worn 
 we still have her size in stock if she 'd like to purchase another pair but i ca n't accept the return '' 
 after this the women hung up 
 we thought that was the end of it until we got a call a week later from the same women saying that she had to drive 3 hours to the next city to find the right shoes after her experience with our terrible customer service and blaming us for having to pay for the gas money and the cost of the new shoes 
 i simply said i 'm sorry for your trouble '' but looking back i wish i could have said something 
 i would n't want to be the manager at that store when she returns in 2 years demanding a refund 
 i work at a pet store that closes at 6pm on sundays 
 last weekend i was put on the door at 6 to make sure that : 1. someone was able to open the door for those leaving 
 2. that no one else was able to <unk> in 
 sometimes my co-workers feel sorry for a shopper 
 i never back down 
 as i was on door duty i saw a lady outside walking her dog in the <unk> next to the parking 
 i just assumed she had picked her pup up from grooming and was letting it <unk> before getting into her car 
 i was wrong 
 as i let another person out i notice she was approaching the door 
 me : sorry we close at <unk> her : you serious 
 i been walking my dog out here for <unk> 
 and now you say i ca n't come inside 
 me : i 'm sorry 
 we close at <unk> her : this is fucking ridiculous ... she started saying more but alas i shut the door in her face and turned my back to her 
 the <unk> of <unk> few years ago i worked at a big popular cosmetics store as a <unk> <unk> a company certified <unk> <unk> actually 
 sometimes rude customers would assume i was a complete moron just <unk> off random <unk> info to sell stuff 
 because retail workers are <unk> <unk> of actually having accurate product knowledge or an intelligence level above a <unk> 
 anyway one day a middle-aged woman asked for help finding an <unk> <unk> for her sensitive <unk> skin 
 i recommended one that had <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> among other things and <unk> <unk> a <unk> that is naturally present throughout the human body and is able to <unk> <unk> its weight in water it <unk> <unk> gives your eyeballs their <unk> and is a major <unk> of your skin as it <unk> <unk> and <unk> etc 
 excellent stuff 
 well i got about as far as this would be a fantastic product for you as it contains both <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> '' before she cut me off with excuse me 
 i 'm not going to put anything with <unk> on my face 
 do you think i 'm stupid '' 
 i really had to hold my tongue at that question 
 i politely explained that the word <unk> merely refers to the <unk> balance of the ingredient and that since human skin is <unk> when its <unk> level is maintained at its naturally <unk> level that <unk> are not only perfectly safe to use on your skin but <unk> to <unk> in most cases 
 i then went on to say that while obviously not all <unk> are safe for human skin such as <unk> or <unk> <unk> that those particular <unk> are not going to be found in <unk> products 
 * really 
 we have nothing to gain from doing that 
 it 's a terrible terrible idea 
 she was still not convinced and went off on me about how we must think that people are really really stupid if we 're <unk> all our products full of <unk> 
 she 's seen enough news stories about <unk> attacks and people 's skin melting off to know better 
 then she had the nerve to scoff at my <unk> <unk> '' badge on my <unk> and ask what kind of <unk> program the company was running if the <unk> '' did n't know that <unk> was bad for you 
 i replied ma'am this company actually has an excellent training program 
 however *i* learned the basics about <unk> in 7th grade science 
 it 's a class i would <unk> recommend that you take '' 
 then i walked away 
 this happened a few years ago this was roughly around <unk> 
 i just <unk> upon this subreddit and thought i 'd share this horrifying story 
 i 'm on mobile so there may be spelling mistakes 
 i live in a canadian city and work in a fast food restaurant 
 saturday mornings usually have nothing but high-school students working so being saturday mornings there tends to be a lot of people calling off and claiming to be sick '' 
 this day was no different 
 it was a cold <unk> saturday morning i was working drive-thru with one other employee we normally have 3 or 4 people working the drive thru but like i said people tend to call in sick 
 storefront was packed and there was a <unk> going out the store only 2 people we 're working when normally there is 4 or 5 
 just to give you an idea of how busy it was 
 i loved days when it 's this busy makes the shift go by fast 
 seeing as it was so cold normally we switched the window person with another position every 30 minutes or every hour if it was busy 
 it was my turn on <unk> orders 
 i was doing great had a good flow 
 the line was moving fast 
 everybody was doing the best they could 
 you always get one or two <unk> customers 
 for the sake of this story lets name this one him ah 
 beep beep beep hello may i take your order please '' 
 - me yes can i get a medium coffee regular and a cheese croissant <unk> sure that 'll me $ <unk> pull up to the next window please '' - me eventually the man makes his way to the window 
 already i could tell this was n't the best of mornings for him 
 he was a big <unk> construction worker he was <unk> driving a big <unk> truck already he was intimidating 
 he had change in his hand and was reaching out the window waiting for me to take it 
 $ <unk> please '' - me i start reaching for the change as i can see he 's ready to go give me my food first 
 - ah as he pulls his hand away sorry sir i 'll need to take your money first '' -me give me my food first then i 'll fuckin pay <unk> oh um ... uh sorry sir your food is ready but i <unk> to take your money first '' -me starting to get confused what the fuck 
 why do you need to take my money first 
 <unk> as he shakes his head is disbelief 
 at this point i was very nervous 
 he was visibly angry it was as if this was a life or death situation 
 he needed his coffee and croissant first even though he had the fucking change ready in his hand 
 i did n't know what to do and people on storefront were already looking at us uhm it 's <unk> sir i need you to pay before i can give you your order 
 - me that 's the <unk> fucking policy i 've ever fucking heard of the coffee is right fucking there and you ca n't give me it before i fucking pay 
 here 
 fucking <unk> <unk> down the change 
 it was the exact change $ <unk> flat 
 um <unk> you sir have a good day hands out the order - me at this point i 'm pretty shaken up 
 i have no ability to process what just happened because already he 's driving away and the next car is pulling up and the beep beep beep is in my ear 
 people are telling me i dealt with that customer very well and are patting me on the back 
 i mean he was <unk> full out yelling customers were looking shaking their heads apparently and the manager on duty told me to take a couple minutes and told me i handled him well but next time if a customer swears at me i can by law deny him service 
 it felt good knowing i was in the right and i carried on with my day 
 not to say he did n't ruin my mood a bit though 
 for the rest of the day i was in complete disbelief of why he acted that way 
 did i <unk> him 
 why was he so angry 
 he had the exact change ready 
 a couple weeks later my manager calls me into the office to speak to me 
 now even when i did nothing wrong i always get frightened thinking i was in trouble as i 'm sure we all do 
 she tells me a customer called and wrote in to complain about me 
 the written complaint went something like this 
 hi and good afternoon 
 i 'm writing to you today because i am completely <unk> by your company 
 never in my life have i received such terrible customer service 
 i went in yesterday morning 
 not only did i wait 15 minutes in the drive thru waiting for my order to be taken 
 which btw is a big lie sometimes it happens i 'll admit but this day was n't one of them we were on our a game when i finally reach the order box i am greeted by a <unk> rude young lady who basically cuts me off and tells me to pull ahead 
 when i get to the window i see a young girl who seemed to be a manager i was wearing the managers sweater as it was cold out and she is demanding my money i politely ask for my order first and before i even get to finish she cuts me off and tells me it 's fucking policy '' 
 i 'll repeat never in my life have i received such customer service let alone from a manager 
 please get back to me and let me know what you can do about this and please get rid of these awful managers '' '' 
 <unk> she told me she was there and she will be calling the district manager about this 
 not only did he ruin my day but he also tried to get me fired 
 just another day working in the customer service <unk> my work when you 're off the clock you 're allowed to be in <unk> areas of the store you just are n't allowed to be <unk> customers <unk> managers unless you need one for your own personal shopping reasons and such 
 i 'm in the front of the store behind the customer service desk 
 i hear a lady <unk> & gt l : excuse me '' 
 i pretty much ignore it as : 1 i 'm off the clock 2 i 'm collecting personal items and 3 there 's three <unk> behind the desk all on the clock and one is doing absolutely nothing 
 i go to leave the customer service desk through the side door and this lady is essentially blocking my <unk> 
 & gt l : i said <unk> <unk> now help me '' 
 & gt me : sorry ma'am i ca n't help you right now 
 i 'm off the clock '' 
 & gt l : what do you mean you 're <unk> the clock boy '' 
 i just walk off at this point 
 she 's treating me in an awful manner and i 'm not getting paid to deal with it so ... & gt l screeching : i want your <unk> manager '' 
 i just point to the customer service desk and say & gt if you 'd like the manager on duty i 'd assume you 'd need to ask an employee who is authorized to call for one '' 
 & gt l : no 
 you do it '' 
 & gt me : it 's actually illegal for me to do that while i 'm off the clock our company <unk> that work '' 
 the lady huffs and puffs her way to the customer service desk 
 the mod is called and the customer walks back over to me and attempts to grab me to make sure i ca n't go anywhere 
 the <unk> behind the desk motions the word stay '' to me and because the <unk> is one of my friends i do 
 my mod walks up after what seems like an eternity and asks what the problem is 
 & gt l : your employee is just <unk> 
 he refuses to help me '' 
 & gt mod : <unk> is a customer right now not an employee '' 
 & gt l : then why was he in the employee area '' 
 & gt mod : employees are allowed in the <unk> areas while off the clock so long as they 're at their home store '' 
 & gt l : *well <unk> i want him removed from the store 
 he 's offending me '' 
 & gt mod : he 's done nothing wrong ma'am 
 in fact as a customer here he 's not even required to acknowledge you '' 
 & gt l : i do n't <unk> woman i want him <unk> reprimanded '' 
 & gt mod : i apologize for the inconvenience that this mistake may have caused you ma'am but we 're not going to discipline <unk> in any form here '' 
 the lady is <unk> and i 'm trying to contain myself 
 the grouchy old woman actually touched me physically while trying to keep me in the area earlier so as the lady is walking off i ask the mod : & gt hey would it be possible for us to call the police 
 i 'd like to report an assault by another customer '' 
 & gt mod : of course come with me please '' 
 the mod knew i was joking she could see my face 
 the grouchy old bag turned around and looked at me with horror in her eye 
 i just winked at her and she shuffled her ass out of the store 
 tl dr - woman sees me i 'm not wearing my <unk> and am off clock 
 lady sees me and asks for help i accidentally miss her 
 lady turns into <unk> the <unk> legally <unk> me into <unk> her 
 manager comes around explains law and policy i jokingly ask the manager if we can file a police report lady <unk> out in <unk> 
 yes this is my favorite manager i work with 
 she 's not afraid to tell customers where the bear shits in the woods 
 sorry wall of text <unk> 
 i <unk> stone <unk> and jewelry and in the summer i go to local gem and <unk> shows or just events that go on and set up a booth to sell my product as well as <unk> jesus <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> 
 one beautiful summer day i was relaxing with a cold glass of tea and a delicious <unk> cheese steak sandwich when <unk> old hag <unk> comes up and starts to browse my <unk> 
 she was there for 2 hours literally picking up every single <unk> 
 over 350 of them 
 some more than once 
 finally she picks one up and brings it to me and asks can you take $ 10 for this '' 
 now the rough stone can cost me anywhere from $ 5 to $ 150 a <unk> 
 we cut and shape using diamond <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 add in that they are wrapped in <unk> gold fill or <unk> silver 
 and i still mark my product below retail because the local <unk> could n't handle anything higher 
 so i explain all this to her 
 i walk her through the step by step process to make a <unk> explaining gently and politely that i ca n't mark a $ 50 <unk> down to $ 10 but i would happily sell it for $ 40 
 she proceeds to go on a tirade yelling and cursing about how us young <unk> were trying to rob the older <unk> and how i should be ashamed to <unk> so much 
 she then starts to yell at other customers in my booth about how they should buy elsewhere 
 at this point i tell <unk> she needs to leave or i will flag down the officer they always have at these events 
 <unk> : thats not your decision to make kid 
 go get your superior and see what he says 
 me : yes ma'am right away 
 **i walk into my trailer have a few more <unk> of tea and come back out** me : hello ma'am i am the owner what seems to be the problem 
 <unk> then throws my <unk> at me and walks off muttering to herself 
 unfortunately for her the officer happened to be nearby to catch part of the <unk> of crazy and told her she needs to leave 
 she then begins another rant as she is less than gently escorted out of the park 
 tl dr old <unk> ca n't navigate the great material <unk> very <unk> while back when i was sixteen i had taken a job at a local grocery store 
 i lived in a small town and even through the store was quite small it was the largest one in the county 
 it was the end of my shift and i was waiting for the next employee to get out of the break room to take my place on the stool behind the register 
 the owner refused to allow any employee to work with the register or with anything in the store for that matter after their shift ended 
 so i was sitting on the stool struggling to keep myself <unk> tired beyond <unk> while an impatient customer clicked his <unk> on the tile across from me 
 i 'm sorry sir '' i said 
 <unk> is <unk> 
 he 's been in the break room for ten minutes 
 * i promise this is just as uncomfortable for me as it is for you '' 
 <unk> i was tired 
 twelve hours of checking out customers and i felt like a <unk> <unk> stuck in a <unk> 
 why ca n't you just scan my items '' 
 he asked 
 i would if i could '' 
 i forced my eyes to stay open 
 if i still had the strength to yell i 'd give <unk> a <unk> to <unk> an <unk> <unk> in <unk> bay 
 but if the owner found out i worked after my shift ended he 'd be as angry as you are right now '' 
 the customer 's reply was cut off by the <unk> of <unk> and the slamming of a door 
 mind <unk> with <unk> i look up <unk> into my hand 
 what can i do for you sir '' 
 features hidden by a <unk> <unk> hose he looked quite <unk> 
 from a pocket of rough leather he removed a <unk> <unk> that could have been dropped in a <unk> 
 give me all of it '' 
 oh shit '' 
 i scratched my head 
 where was <unk> 
 why was the man holding a gun 
 sir can you be more specific to what you want '' 
 all the money '' 
 he scratched a <unk> forearm and pushed the other customer out of the way 
 in the cash register 
 all the money '' 
 oh '' 
 i was being robbed 
 all of it '' 
 i 'm sorry sir '' 
 not even the gun <unk> my fatigue 
 i ca n't work the cash register after my shift is over '' 
 really '' 
 he <unk> back an inch 
 yea sorry for the inconvenience '' i said 
 fucking hell '' 
 the robber screamed and <unk> out of the store 
 i <unk> <unk> the stool for a moment <unk> declining 
 the knowledge of what had happened struck me all at once a speeding truck <unk> my mind 
 eyes snapping open i <unk> as loud as i could 
 <unk> 
 hey guys back with a short tale from your favorite sports <unk> 
 a few years ago i worked retail in a baseball <unk> and generally worked in <unk> which sells game used items 
 such items include worn <unk> <unk> balls broken <unk> and the like 
 note : our broken <unk> are just that broken 
 they can have minor or major cracks sometimes split entirely in two 
 the <unk> store is a small booth around the corner from the main store and full of very intimidating and expensive items 
 as such most children thankfully avoid our shop unless they are with their parents 
 most of the time they are well behaved but being kids they have a <unk> to touch things they should n't 
 one <unk> a father and his son came into our booth and started talking sports to my coworker rob 
 the son was super <unk> <unk> by the <unk> cotton candies and <unk> our <unk> provides 
 i watched him <unk> as he ran around touching everything in site 
 his dad told him to calm down but was too engaged in conversation to pay much mind 
 the son wanders over to our broken <unk> section picks one up and starts swinging it around 
 dad tells him to stop but too late 
 the bat goes flying onto the floor of our booth with a loud <unk> 
 cue silence 
 rob walks over very sternly picks up the bat and carefully <unk> a large <unk> crack in the wood 
 & gt rob : oh no 
 you broke this 
 that costs $ 90 
 & gt dad : <unk> a <unk> son you break it you buy it 
 do you have the money to pay for that 
 at this point the son is pale as a ghost and <unk> on the verge of tears 
 rob the dad and myself are trying to hide our smiles 
 rob goes over to the kid and <unk> next to him 
 & gt rob : i 'll tell you what i 'll let this go this one time 
 but you have to promise me you 'll <unk> your father and behave in stores 
 & gt dad : son tell the nice man thank you 
 i hope you learned your lesson 
 & gt son : thanks mister 
 i 'm sorry 
 the dad sent a grateful wink to rob and herded his <unk> son back to the game 
 rob looks at me and laughs 
 & gt rob : thats one less kid trying to destroy our <unk> : large national pet store chain 
 characters : a husband h and wife w : both in their mid 30 's and very heavy me : 25 year old minimum wage slave we were having a slow day so i was pulled off of the cash registers to walk the sales floor 
 i pass a couple looking at the dog training collars so i stop and ask if they need any help 
 h : you know anything about these shock collars 
 me : yeah i can tell you anything that you want to know 
 i go over all of the different features and types of collars and i also recommend speaking with our on site <unk> about getting into some classes if their dog is having some <unk> issues 
 w : thanks for the all of the help 
 oh 
 look hun 
 his name is <unk> too h : nice name dude 
 me : ha ha i knew there was something i liked about you h : dude do you want to see your name on her ass 
 me : what 
 no 
 h : naw man you need to see this me : seriously i 'm good all of a sudden his wife turns around and he pulls down her pants in the middle of the aisle 
 lo and behold my name is right there across her ass me : ... what the fuck man ... w : look he does n't know what to say 
 i think we embarrassed him 
 h : ha ha told you it was there dude they walked away laughing while i stood there just trying to figure out if that had really just happened to <unk> years ago i worked for a small cell phone company 
 i was the only employee in one of their retail stores located in the middle of nowhere texas 
 relevant to the story : with this company there existed a <unk> called bill <unk> reset 
 basically if your bill was due on the <unk> and you did n't pay it until the 20th you could pay the company an extra $ 5 or so to get the billing <unk> changed to the 20th instead of being due again on the <unk> 
 one evening a woman came in to make her very late payment and request a bill <unk> reset 
 since she had been suspended i told her it might take up to 20 mins for her service to switch on and to be able to request that reset 
 she said it was no big deal that she 'd just go to the restaurant next door to get a bite to eat in the meantime 
 i agree and remind her that she has to come back today or we wo n't be able to do it 
 she <unk> me with a wave of her hand and leaves 
 fast forward two hours later 
 i got caught up watching something on <unk> and actually forgot about closing the store locking the doors 20 minutes after our usual closing time 
 the next day in comes the same woman from the day before 
 she says she 's ready to submit that reset request and i go into a <unk> i know all too well by then : me : sorry ma'am i was only able to submit that request yesterday as it was the day you made your payment 
 there 's nothing i can do now 
 customer : what 
 i told you i was coming back 
 you 're <unk> my <unk> or i 'm closing my account 
 me : yes you told me you were returning yesterday 
 today is too late 
 c : well ... what if i called corporate and told them you closed your doors early yesterday 
 i came back you just left early because you 're a lazy employee 
 me : ... i was actually here later than usual 
 besides we have cameras that will show that i did no such thing 
 i point to the eight cameras my boss had set up around the store this wipes the smirk off her face 
 she suddenly looks very <unk> 
 c : <unk> god will punish you if you do n't help out your fellow <unk> 
 you will go to hell if you continue to be so selfish and <unk> 
 i have no idea what to say at this point 
 you run into a lot of <unk> in small towns in texas but this lady ... me : um ... well i 'm not christian ma'am 
 so i do n't believe that 's relevant 
 c : oh 
 what are you then 
 me : ... <unk> 
 she left without a word and i never saw her again 
 i hope she got that whole billing thing <unk> <unk> i am a recent college graduate from a <unk> <unk> media course 
 so far this summer i haven’t had a whole lot of luck with finding jobs as a <unk> <unk> 
 i have been applying everywhere and finally got contacted by an employer 2 weeks ago for my first <unk> gig out of college 
 as i was discussing with my employer what kind of equipment i have and what i could do i realized that for this job i would need a new piece of equipment for my camera that was quite a bit of money 
 i knew it cost around $ 400 and that being a broke college <unk> i have barely any money 
 so i check my bank account to see if theres any possibility that i can go and get this new piece of equipment that i need 
 it was payday for my minimum wage part time job and somehow i had $ <unk> in my account 
 so off the camera store i go 
 i get to the local camera store and talk to the first customer service representative '' i see an old guy who we’ll call ed 
 i say hey this is what im looking for what do you have 
 so he takes me over to the product and starts showing it to me 
 we start talking about what i’m doing and how i’m a recent college <unk> who just got there first job and how i’m putting everything i have into this equipment so i can do this job 
 i tell him about what i’m <unk> and how im driving over <unk> the next day just to do this job 
 & gt me : great awesome that is exactly what i need 
 how much is it going to be after tax 
 & gt ed : <unk> & gt me : damn ok let me check my bank i think i only have $ <unk> 
 & gt ed : ok here how bout this you tell me what you have in your bank and i’ll make it work 
 im just an old guy who is <unk> and doesn’t give a shit about commission 
 i just do this to keep me busy 
 i’ll see how low i can bring it 
 & gt me : wow awesome thanks man 
 ya i only have $ <unk> show him my phone & gt ed : ok so the total is now $ <unk> 
 do you have any change on you 
 & gt me : ya in the car let me go grab it quick 
 so i go out to the car and start looking 
 i left about $ 5 in change in there the night before so it <unk> be a problem 
 except that its gone nothing 
 no quarters under the seat no <unk> nothing 
 you have to be kidding me right 
 so i start calling my mom to see if she can <unk> me $ 5 so i can get this equipment 
 no answer 
 call again no answer 
 call again no answer 
 wow 
 this would happen 
 65 cents short of getting this thing and somebody stole my change 
 as i’m building up the <unk> to stand in front of the beer store and pan handle for a dollar ed comes running out of the store finds me in my car and does this.. & gt ed : <unk> a <unk> 
 i couldn’t let you walk away from a deal like that because of a dollar 
 & gt me : dude you are the biggest life <unk> ever thank you so much 
 & gt ed : don’t worry man i’m just an old guy who doesn’t give a shit about the commission and i can tell you’re a good kid just trying to get a break into the industry 
 & gt me : man thank you soooo much 
 so we go back into the store to pay 
 meanwhile i’m thanking this guy the whole way 
 & gt ed : alright so thats going to be $ <unk> on debit 
 & gt me : awesome thanks man so much 
 & gt ed : hang on 
 let me do one more thing 
 <unk> be our little secret ... & gt me : ok ... & gt ed : so thats going to be $ 400 on debit 
 & gt me : isnt it gets cut off & gt ed : <unk> proceeds to take out his wallet take $ 40 out and put it in the cash register 
 & gt me : dude you are amazing 
 & gt ed : well i couldn’t let you leave here completely broke could i 
 you’re going to need money for gas and food 
 & gt me : ed you are the greatest guy ever thank you so much 
 & gt ed : i’m just some old guy who wants to pay it forward 
 i don’t give a shit about the commission 
 have fun with your new equipment and i wish you the best of luck with your career 
 just do one thing for me 
 & gt me : whats that 
 & gt ed : when you get the chance to pay it forward when you’re older do it 
 & gt me : yes sir 
 thank you so so so so so much 
 & gt ed : have fun tomorrow 
 so i walk out of this store with a new piece of camera equipment that would have normally cost $ <unk> 
 ed took his $ 25 commission off and then paid $ <unk> out of his own pocket so i could get it and still have gas money to get to my shoot the next day 
 as much as the retail industry sucks there truly is great people in it 
 because of this new piece of equipment i have been able to secure more <unk> positions and my client base is slowly starting to grow and i am making a name for myself 
 all because some old guy who doesn’t give a shit about commission decided to pay it forward 
 at my last <unk> the owners of my shop also owned a <unk> sporting goods <unk> shop next door 
 the guys over there would hop next door and chat with us while it was slow we were all on friendly terms 
 i went away for vacation and when i came back boy was there <unk> 
 <unk> '' one of the <unk> and most helpful employees had been fired 
 funny thing was <unk> had <unk> been on vacation out of state for a family reunion 
 he came back into our shop a couple months later and i got the whole story 
 you see the store manager next door was boss son 
 like many <unk> of <unk> he practically got away with murder 
 showing up late or not showing up for shifts opening shop late <unk> for half the day borrowing '' things for his <unk> <unk> team all that good stuff 
 bs also had a habit of calling his employees to cover shifts at the last minute -- an hour or less of lead time 
 <unk> as i mentioned had his vacation approved in advance all the paperwork in order tickets purchased bags packed everything was <unk> 
 the day he 's set to fly out he gets a text from bs telling him he needs to get to the shop asap to cover bs 's shift 
 not that bs was sick or had some important business function to perform 
 he just had a date 
 no can do obviously -- <unk> is n't going to <unk> a flight at the last minute just to cover bs 's ass 
 so <unk> <unk> back and tells him that since the vacation was approved by bs himself as of two months ago he wo n't be coming in 
 bs being the mature and responsible manager he is sucks it up and covers the shift himself 
 ... hahaha just kidding 
 no 
 he fires <unk> via text instead 
 <unk> he takes it in <unk> 
 goes on vacation gets back and instead of heading to work heads right to the <unk> office to file a claim for wrongful <unk> paperwork and copies of <unk> in hand 
 then he goes to a friend who worked for the city and gets a much more <unk> and <unk> job same day 
 nice thing was when all was said and done he won his suit for wrongful <unk> and *still got <unk> <unk> <unk> payments despite already having another <unk> 
 apparently in this state the <unk> office does a routine conference call with employees and <unk> when verifying claims just to get both sides of the story at once 
 bs was <unk> and <unk> of his actions proudly <unk> his role in the matter 
 of course it 's not like bs was <unk> in any way 
 as far as i know he still manages that place ... <unk> station story 
 i 'm <unk> to the <unk> but it 's not uncommon for people to have no idea what they 're doing when buying lottery tickets 
 a customer walks in and starts filling out a mega <unk> bet slip 
 i run it through our machine and print his tickets 3 mega <unk> tickets with the <unk> 
 & gt **me : ** your total is $ <unk> '' 
 & gt **guy : ** six 
 no it should be nine '' 
 i show him his ticket $ <unk> is clearly printed on it 
 & gt **guy : ** oh i wanted you to run my slip as powerball sorry '' 
 i guess it 's my fault for not reading his mind 
 & gt **me : ** um that 's not how the machines work 
 i 'll actually have you fill out a powerball slip for that '' 
 & gt **guy : ** okay can you cancel these tickets for me '' 
 oh boy & gt **me : ** no i 'm afraid these tickets are unable to be cancelled once i print them '' 
 & gt **guy : ** ... so what you 're saying is there *is* a way to cancel them but you just do n't know how to do it '' 
 what 
 & gt **me : ** no they ca n't be cancelled at all 
 in fact there 's a warning screen specifically saying these tickets ca n't be cancelled '' 
 & gt **guy : ** no i 'm pretty sure there 's a way 
 i 've cancelled tickets in the past '' 
 & gt **me : ** um that must 've been for a different type of lottery 
 <unk> ca n't be cancelled '' 
 & gt **guy : ** so i have to buy these now '' 
 & gt **me : ** ... yes '' 
 & gt **guy : ** ... okay that 's fine 
 sorry i do n't play lotto often '' 
 tl dr : customer does n't take no for an answer <unk> i must be incompetent 
 <unk> : <unk> <unk> hey all this is a story from many years ago back when i used to work at a electronics / computer / appliance / media retailer 
 sorry it 's so long 
 i get <unk> sometimes 
 the backstory : apparently a man and wife came in and wanted to purchase a refrigerator 
 they found a couple they liked for something around $ 1000 
 they picked one and paid for it on their credit card 
 they set it up to be delivered some time a few days later 
 no real issues at this point 
 the next day the woman came back in 
 they decided they had changed their minds and did n't want that specific refrigerator anymore and wanted to think about <unk> to the other one they liked instead 
 no problem 
 delivery was canceled 
 this is where the core problem occurred : she neglected to bring the credit card presumably her husband 's they had originally paid with back in 
 at this time i do n't know if it 's different now ... i have n't worked there in over a decade we could only process a credit card return if we had the original card to put the money back on 
 she did n't have it and they lived an hour away 
 a manager was called over 
 this manager told the woman in front of two different customer service <unk> that because she did n't have the credit card we could only process the return for store credit unless of course she made the two hour round trip to grab the credit card 
 the woman was not happy about this but agreed since they were planning on buying a refrigerator with that money anyway 
 as the manager was processing the return he very specifically said something along the lines of just so you know after the close of business today we will no longer be able to <unk> this transaction 
 you will be stuck with the store credit and there 's absolutely no way for us to get this money back onto your credit card give it back to you in cash etc 
 if you want the money back on the credit card you need to show back up here to the store with the credit card before the end of the day and then we have a way we 'll be able to put the money back on the card 
 after the close of business though there 's literally nothing we can do to get the money back on the card '' 
 the woman <unk> this accepted the store credit voucher and went on her way 
 now here 's where i come in : the next day i 'm working loss prevention for the store standing at the front checking receipts <unk> cameras etc 
 nothing out of the usual was happening when all of a sudden i hear a loud commotion coming from the customer service desk 
 a woman is yelling at one of the customer service <unk> something along the lines of you guys are thieves 
 give me back my money '' 
 it was the woman from the day before 
 at this point i have no idea what the situation is though 
 i ask someone to cover the desk for me and head over to see what is going on 
 the manager who had helped her out the day before happened to be there 
 he arrived at customer service desk at the same time i did 
 apparently when her husband got home from work that night after we had already closed he informed her that he had already purchased another refrigerator from one of our competitors assuming she would be able to handle the return of the one they had purchased from us 
 she informed him of the store credit situation and he got pissed 
 she was sent back to try to do the return she was already informed would be impossible 
 the manager did what he could to calm the woman down 
 she was screaming and crying and talking about how we robbed them of her money etc 
 the manager reminded the woman of the conversation they had the day before 
 of course she accused the manager of lying and said he never told her anything like that 
 however he had witnesses and in addition that exact policy was spelled out in plain english on both her receipt and the wall right next to her 
 it was literally impossible for him to process the return now that the close of business had come and gone 
 at this point she had $ 1000 store credit and you ca n't return store credit 
 he apologized but said there was nothing he could do and asked her to step aside if she did n't have any other business 
 she stepped aside but then just started swearing at every customer as they approached the customer service desk 
 do n't fucking buy anything from these assholes 
 they will steal your fucking money '' 
 at the point i had to ask her to leave as she was causing a disturbance 
 she <unk> but on her way out yelled i am calling my husband 
 wait until he gets here 
 you fuckers will all pay '' 
 fast forward a few hours and in storms the most irate looking man i 've ever seen in my life 
 face beet red ... <unk> <unk> ... looking like he 's ready to punch the first person who says a word to him 
 he 's not a big dude or anything ... but he 
 looks 
 pissed 
 he storms up to me and to his credit quite calmly says please point me towards customer service '' 
 i point 
 he heads off that way 
 i know there 's going to be trouble at this point so i call back to the warehouse and ask for the biggest guys back there to come up to the front 
 i <unk> out 
 we had a guy back there who was about <unk> '' probably 400 <unk> and another who was about <unk> '' <unk> at this point i was about <unk> '' and maybe 180. together we were a <unk> enough force that i figured we 'd be able to handle whatever happened 
 i got someone to cover the desk and headed over to customer service 
 by the time i get there the dude is already screaming his ass off at some poor 19 year old customer service <unk> who is desperately trying to get anyone 's attention to come help her 
 the manager gets there just as i do again and tries to calm the man down 
 the man is n't hearing a word of it though 
 he throws the credit card and store credit voucher in the customer service <unk> face and says if that money does n't get back on that card in the next two minutes something bad is going to happen '' 
 well he was right 
 i approach the man from behind and i see the two guys from the warehouse <unk> up 
 the manager says sir your wife was informed of our return policies when she processed the return 
 there 's literally nothing anyone here in the store can do for you '' 
 the man replies bullshit 
 you guys can do it 
 and you will do it '' 
 my manager sir i assure you we literally ca n't 
 the system wo n't allow it 
 there 's nothing we can do 
 you need to leave '' 
 the man says no 
 fuck that 
 i 'm not leaving until i get my money 
 i do n't care how 
 pull $ 1000 cash out of the drawer 
 i do n't care 
 give me my fucking money '' 
 my manager says sir we ca n't help you 
 the corporate number is on your original receipt 
 maybe they can do something 
 we ca n't do it here 
 you need to calm down and leave the premises now '' 
 the guy says i 'm not going anywhere 
 fuck you '' 
 manager says i have now asked you to leave 
 if you do n't leave the premises in the next 10 seconds i 'm calling the police and having you arrested for trespassing '' 
 the guy responds fuck you 
 call them 
 i do n't give a fuck '' 
 so the manager picks up the phone and starts <unk> 
 meanwhile the dude starts screaming at the customer service <unk> again who just looks like a deer in headlights 
 i say firmly sir you have been asked to leave 
 you are trespassing 
 it is really in your best interest to leave now before things get worse '' 
 this apparently startled him 
 he did n't know i was there 
 he quickly turns and swings at me 
 luckily for me the dude was off balance and threw a terrible punch so i was able to <unk> out of the way of it 
 i charge him and slam him into the customer service desk 
 the other two dudes from the warehouse jump in and we <unk> the guy to the ground where the 400 <unk> dude just holds him down 
 the guy <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the weight of this huge guy swearing up a storm ah fuck you get off me fuck you pieces of shit ... fucking assholes '' 
 this lasted for a couple of minutes 
 after realizing he 's not nearly strong enough to get out of the situation he starts to calm down and bargain 
 okay okay ... you 're right ... i should just go 
 just let me up and i 'll leave calmly '' 
 my manager having gotten off the phone with the police at this point says we gave you plenty of chances for that 
 you decided not to go 
 at this point you assaulted one of my employees and you are going to go to jail '' 
 and went to jail he did 
 he was charged with battery for throwing the cards in the customer service <unk> 's face assault for verbal threats such as something bad is going to happen '' and swinging at me and trespassing failing to leave the premises when ordered 
 he <unk> guilty across the board 
 i never heard what his sentence was 
 and that 's the time i was assaulted because of a <unk> still am in disbelief that this actually <unk> ... i worked a morning shift from <unk> at a shoe store in a very busy mall 
 this couple comes in our store with their <unk> year old daughter and asks to try on a pair of pink <unk> bow uggs i come back with the shoe for her and asks & gt can you take her shoes off and put the <unk> on for her 
 which is really weird that she or her husband couldnt take her shoe off instead of some random worker at a shoe store ... so i get on my knees to take off her shoes and put the 2 <unk> 's <unk> of me and right under the bench the girl is sitting on 
 after i take the first shoe off i hear a weird noise and look down and she fucking pissed herself on the bench and because our <unk> are <unk> it got all over my shoes and the brand new uggs 
 the family is apologizing and saying how sorry they are and i was telling them that its not a problem let me just get my manager so you guys can pay for the uggs your daughter just fucking pee 'd on and they look at me and walk out of the store 
 i got my manager from the back and he called mall security but they were never caught 
 im hoping one day the pee pants <unk> will be found and convicted of her wrong <unk> 
 our landlord is a jerk so we 've had a roof that 's leaked like a <unk> for 5 years 
 finally work is being done on the roof and it 's a little <unk> but when it rains i do n't have to cover the sales floor with <unk> and wet floor signs 
 progress is being made 
 you can hear the <unk> up top banging around with <unk> using <unk> using some other machine that makes the <unk> sounds from disaster movie <unk> and general loud <unk> when they move <unk> materials around or onto the roof 
 you can actually see the <unk> <unk> and <unk> lift cart <unk> around the plaza along with a big box truck that has the <unk> 's name on the side of the truck 
 on to my boss b and a <unk> customer dc : & gt * : <unk> <unk> : <unk> & gt dc : oh my god 
 what 's that noise 
 it 's soooo annoying 
 & gt b : there 's <unk> 
 we wo n't have a <unk> roof this winter 
 & gt dc : are you sure it 's safe to have people in here 
 & gt b : actually the <unk> are just a cover story i made up to keep you from panicking 
 the <unk> is literally falling 
 my employees and i have <unk> to continue serving you up until the very end but you should probably go home to be with your loved ones 
 & gt <unk> glares at my boss with a look between stunned disbelief and annoyed <unk> 
 * & gt b : you 're perfectly safe here 
 we would n't be open otherwise 
 funny and he pays me to be here 
 what more could you ask for i work in a small convenience store that gets a rush of customers at around <unk> 6pm and 7pm 
 we usually have 3 people who work tills and the floor stocking shelves and one manager 
 tonight there was one girl who was on who was known for being a bit of a <unk> and i personally find her really annoying 
 i like to work the floor as much as possible while she does tills and it works out alright for both of us 
 during our 6pm rush the girl 's mother who is also a regular comes in picks up a couple of things and goes to the register waiting to be served by her daughter 
 im standing in line waiting to buy food for me to eat while on break when suddenly my coworker motions for me to come out of the line and she runs out the back area red in the face 
 weird but alright 
 i push through the queue as politely as i can and work through the line of customers while her mother walks around to our back area 
 then i hear the scream 
 and the crying 
 really loud uncomfortable crying 
 i rush through the line as fast as i can so i can go out and see whats wrong and as the line <unk> off i go out the back 
 there she is bawling her eyes out 
 my manager is offering her a ride home she was in no state to drive and her mother was trying to <unk> her and failing 
 she ended up just gathering her stuff and walking out with her mother who drove her home 
 i asked my manager about it and learned the story 
 her mother had decided that it was a fantastic idea to go in during the middle of her daughter 's shift at her job which gives her hardly any shifts already and in the middle of a rush to tell her daughter that her father the girls grandfather had passed away 
 just then 
 i got very very angry when i heard that 
 first of all could the mother have not chosen a better time to tell her daughter such horrible news 
 secondly now her car is <unk> in the parking lot and its going to be annoying to get it to her home 
 <unk> did her mother not think that it was embarrassing to her daughter to cry in front of so many people 
 and also why would you put her in a worse situation <unk> 
 each shift makes a difference to her 
 so horrible 
 im very very angry at the mother of my coworker 
 sorry for bad formatting im on mobile tired from my shift and very <unk> have worked at a grocery store for the past 5 1/2 years and have a bunch of favorite regulars 
 last night a regular customer every day regular comes through my till carrying his 2 1/2 year old son who is being cheeky and adorable as usual 
 he suddenly gets excited and shakes his dad 's shoulder and says <unk> has <unk> '' 
 at first i thought i <unk> him but he repeats himself 
 he then points right at me very excited at this revelation and says <unk> you have <unk> 
 you have <unk> '' 
 his dad is trying to <unk> him and says yes i think <unk> knows this '' 
 his son felt the need to tell him about two more times still 
 the dad apologized and explained that they had just had a conversation about private parts 
 i was in hysterics the whole time the poor dad was embarrassed 
 it made my evening though 
 tldr a toddler informed me that i have <unk> time lurker first time poster 
 so i apologize if the formatting is bad 
 some of the fast food stories here gave me old flashbacks to my days working fast food 
 background : i worked at a well known fast food chain and the store was one of the busiest in the area 
 i often worked the late night crew and we closed at 3am 
 all late night crew wear headsets to help speed up making the food as only two people are working the line 
 the story : it 's been a slow night 
 we 've had time to clean most of the stuff and get everything ready for close 
 3am rolls around and we lock the drive thru window then go about putting away food that we keep and <unk> the rest 
 roughly <unk> a car pulls into the drive thru 
 at this time our automated message starts talking the usual message about us being closed thank you for choosing us but please come back tomorrow 
 instead of driving away the driver starts ordering 
 m = manager 
 <unk> = customer & gt <unk> : yeah can i get a number 4 with a large soda at this point my manager talks to them thru the headset & gt m : sir we are closed for the night 
 you will have to come back tomorrow & gt <unk> : what do you mean 
 we are hungry 
 & gt m : we are sorry but most of our food has been put away 
 we ca n't even make what you want 
 & gt <unk> : you can still make it 
 just pull the food back out 
 & gt m : we ca n't 
 have a great night sir 
 at this point we assume thats the end and go back to cleaning but it 's never that easy 
 we hear a banging sound at our drive thru window 
 we all look to see a car sitting there with a <unk> sounding voice yelling about how we need to make their food because they are hungry 
 & gt m : sir we are closed 
 we ca n't even make your food if we wanted to 
 & gt <unk> : you need to make our food 
 we got like 5 people here 
 thats like $ 30 you can make 
 you need that and we need food 
 so serve us 
 & gt m : sir this is the busiest chain in the district 
 we do n't need your money and we could n't even if we wanted to 
 now leave 
 finally the car understood that they were n't getting any food and left 
 do they just assume we can magically pull food out of thin air 
 some of the prep time for their order takes an hour or two so we could n't even if we wanted to 
 tl dr : customer comes after we 're closed demands we serve them without ingredients to make food 
 i work in a strip mall 
 the collection of stores consists of very few name brand places and several <unk> style stores that provide a number of obscure or unexpected services 
 while i work in one of the actual retail chains this one comes from one of our across the hall <unk> a <unk> store one of the mom and pop businesses 
 business is carrying on as usual for them which is to say actually quite <unk> 
 of course the problem customer <unk> a middle aged man looking for dinner candles 
 however the request quickly becomes incredibly specific : he is looking for red candles that are exactly seven inches pointed and were packaged in a way that displayed <unk> with wine on the little cardboard thing '' 
 now with something that <unk> the cashiers went ahead and checked around 
 however in the back room the owner was taking some stock and gave the cashier in the back room the <unk> they had never sold seven inch candles like that it was all for <unk> stuff and 9-10 in 
 candles 
 the only tall '' ones they had were <unk> too 
 the cashier returned with a set of red candles which had been <unk> wrapped not factory produced or anything and the customer actually gets insulted 
 they could not be above seven inches nor could they be <unk> 
 he then insisted that the candle store was the last place he had gotten them a few years back '' 
 he starts to get irate <unk> his hands on the <unk> for each syllable and getting louder like doing so will somehow make these candles <unk> or make the cashiers realize they are wrong in some way for these things not existing 
 he gets increasingly angrier <unk> the small store 's registers to 1 instead of 2 as he <unk> one and refuses to move unless he gets these very specific seven inch red dinner candles with the picture on the front 
 no no i got them here 
 this was the only place i got them '' 
 the supervisor gets involved 
 he tries to explain the only thing they have are the ones the cashier brought up 
 the man falls back on his previous argument of no i know i got them here '' 
 and in general being so flustered it 's making customers leave the store 
 this carries on for almost two hours 
 two 
 hours 
 every cashier has been involved and the supervisor 
 even we across the way can see this as it <unk> through the glass windows 
 finally another guy comes up from behind all the other customers behind the register with a set of the red candles 
 he asks the cashier for a <unk> <unk> them out and <unk> the flat ends off 
 he slams them down onto the counter and yells here 's your f***ing candles 
 now since i know you can take more than seven inches back there when the stick is out take em and get out '' 
 the <unk> storms out in a huff swearing up a storm 
 the guy turns back to the cashier group and gets really pissed 
 he screams at them as if they have <unk> him somehow 
 i want to talk to your owner '' 
 the supervisor shrugs bewildered and says : you just did 
 so i 'm an assistant manager for a big national storage chain 
 not the orange one 
 today was really slow right up til my manager took his lunch break 
 suddenly i am <unk> 
 i bust out some <unk> and unit transfers 
 i go through the rental process with this polite middle aged hispanic woman 
 i finish up the <unk> and take her to her unit 
 on the way back down afterward she tells me on the elevator thank you 
 you were so nice '' 
 and i tell her i appreciate hearing that 
 then she <unk> up to me and says and you have a nice ... '' and full on grabs my junk 
 the <unk> and the stones 
 i throw my hands up and muster my strength and <unk> uhh ... no '' 
 and she steps back and says sorry and i say yeah ... not cool '' 
 she asks if i have a girlfriend or something and i say yeah 
 the elevator opens and we walk back toward the office quietly and then she says quietly so ... i just use this code to get through the gate '' 
 i tell her yes and as soon as she is out of the store i tell my manager who has just returned from lunch what happened clocked out for lunch and ate some <unk> and cheese to make myself feel better post <unk> 
 i guess friendly customer service just brings out the worst in some <unk> is the tale of how i got my job at the car <unk> not to much background for this one 
 i had been looking for a job for awhile and been sending my resume this way and that 
 saw the add on a job site emailed in my resume 
 told to come in for an interview on such and such date no time just some time that day 
 <unk> on the day of the <unk> i get there and the place is wrapped around the little lane all the way to the street but nobody 's moving 
 i see a little cashier 's booth and make my way over in the hopes of finding an employee 
 however the booth was empty 
 i stood around kinda lost for a bit something like 10 minutes 
 i eventually go over and open the door to the main building only to be confronted with lots of back end <unk> and pumps and figured i should just wait by the booth rather then nose my way around 
 at this point the line of cars is really <unk> 
 people are honking trying to move and being stubborn 
 thankfully an employee came out a little while later and he starts trying to get people to back out of there 
 i see an opportunity to get myself a good word in and start helping him get people out 
 once we have everyone out of there he finally turns to me 
 & gt & gt him : you 're the guy that has interview today right 
 & gt & gt me : yes that would be me 
 & gt & gt him : well it might be awhile we are having some major problems with the <unk> hands me a <unk> and an actual application form why do n't you fill this out 
 & gt & gt me : alright 
 no rush i do n't want to make myself <unk> 
 i fill out the form while he stands at the window telling anyone who shows up that the wash is <unk> closed for maintenance 
 a few minutes pass and he keeps glancing inside obviously worried 
 & gt & gt me : i can finish filling this out and tell people about the <unk> if you want to go inside and help 
 & gt & gt him : really 
 & gt & gt me : yeah no trouble 
 i 'll be waiting here either way 
 the guy rushes inside leaving me to deal with customers 
 i finish the form rather quickly 
 i stay at the booth politely and calmly telling anyone who shows up about the <unk> and bid them a good day 
 20 minutes later the employee who was working the booth runs out 
 & gt & gt him : hey man 
 the <unk> almost got everything up and running 
 you 're pretty much a sure hire now the manager was really impressed when i told him how you were already helping out 
 & gt & gt me : glad to hear it 
 thanks for putting in a good word 
 not 5 minutes later the manager comes out <unk> himself and i do the same 
 he looks me up and down pauses for a second and says you 're hired 
 welcome to the team 
 .i was a cashier at a grocery store and had an uncomfortable situation happen 
 the line was slow and a man came to my line followed by another man crazy man or cm 
 cm stood really close to the first guy so i naturally assumed they were together 
 i finished the first guy 's order and turned to organize plastic bags next to me thinking both had left 
 cm caught my attention and i apologized then this exchange happened 
 & gt cm : you were ignoring me 
 & gt me : i apologize sir 
 do you want paper or plastic bags today 
 & gt cm : you are so rude 
 you ignored me 
 & gt me : paper or plastic 
 & gt cm : plastic 
 <unk> you ignored me 
 i do n't like you 
 & gt me : i apologize again 
 i thought you were <unk> & gt cm : you ignored me 
 this went on the whole transaction 
 after minutes of cm glaring and saying i was ignoring him he finally left still glaring at me as he left 
 i leaned on my register and put my head in my hands frustrated when the bagger leans over and says <unk> you 're ignoring me '' 
 i do n't think cm ever came back but his quote became a running joke among my <unk> i was working with this particular company henceforth called <unk> we were running a promotion with a local lingerie store for breast cancer <unk> 
 we <unk> ran the promotion <unk> <unk> contacted the city for appropriate <unk> bought signage etc 
 it was called bras across the bridge 
 people donated their <unk> used bras and received a coupon for the lingerie store and a donation was made to our local cancer foundation 
 we <unk> up the bras across the city 's bridge with signs on either side identifying it 
 a fairly simple effective promotion right 
 everyone loved it 
 newspapers and tv crews came to cover it everyone thought it was a great idea 
 then i get the call every employee <unk> 
 me : good afternoon <unk> this is <unk> speaking '' 
 angry dad ad : hi i just wanted to call about your bra promotion '' 
 me : oh okay how can i help you '' 
 ad : i think you should take them down it 's disgusting '' 
 me : umm ... i 'm sorry '' 
 ad : they 're <unk> 
 ** i have children you know 
 how can you let children see people 's dirty laundry '' 
 me : i 'm sorry you think that i assure you the bras are either new or slightly used 
 this is a promotion for breast cancer <unk> and proceeds are going to support that '' 
 ad more agitated : ** '' i have children 
 this is disgusting 
 you need to take them down immediately 
 my children go by them on the bus everyday and how could you expose them to this <unk> 
 ** this went on for several minutes him demanding us to take them down and me explaining why we were doing this 
 i am pretty calm under pressure in fact i brought over my co-workers so they could hear the shit this guy was spewing 
 we <unk> the phone and were laughing and this grabbed the attention of my boss 
 my boss is a pretty level headed guy 
 he 's got a sense of <unk> he 's fair with all his workers and clients and everyone gets along with him 
 he 's enjoying this tirade at first 
 it finally gets to a point where i 'm just repeating sir this is for breast cancer <unk> this is breast cancer <unk> <unk> * we will be taking down the bras at the end of the month '' 
 angry dad is still yelling and he 's getting on my last nerve 
 my boss was picking up on this and told me to give him the call 
 i ask angry dad if he 'd like to speak to a manager and of course he agrees 
 at this point i can only hear my boss side of the conversation 
 boss : yes this is boss manager of <unk> what seems to be the problem '' 
 <unk> <unk> boss slightly agitated : october is breast cancer <unk> month all of the proceeds go to the local cancer foundation '' 
 <unk> <unk> boss more agitated face turning slightly red : calm down 
 these bras are either new or slightly used 
 they are n't dirty 
 again we are doing this for a good cause '' 
 <unk> <unk> boss fully agitated face now a deep red : this is for <unk> 
 cancer 
 <unk> 
 * we <unk> not** taking down the bras 
 how would *you* feel if a loved one was diagnosed with breast cancer '' 
 <unk> <unk> for at least five <unk> boss full on rage mode veins visibly popping from forehead : ** '' we are n't taking the fucking bras down because you have n't taught your children the difference between men and women 
 bras are clothing 
 if your children do n't know what a bra is they 've got bigger problems 
 this is breast cancer <unk> month i suggest you teach them that 
 do n't call back here you fucking idiot 
 ** my boss then promptly hangs up on angry dad and storms out from his office past my desk and <unk> i just do n't know how some fucking people can <unk> <unk> into shit '' 
 **tl dr** bras are evil and shall be <unk> by angry dad 
 i am a sales associate at a jewelry store known for our <unk> <unk> 
 i started a month ago so they still make me wear my trainee '' tag just <unk> someone gets angry with me 
 i sometimes feel like customers take advantage of me because of this but either way i make my own sales and deal with customers by myself 
 now for the past month everyone has been very understanding and patient with my work 
 customers and co-workers alike 
 however this one older woman came in the other day and completely destroyed the way i see my job 
 <unk> walks in 
 i can tell she is wealthy by all her gold jewelry 
 * me : hello ma'am what brings you in today 
 woman : hi i saw that you have a white <unk> leather bracelet 
 me : sure i 'd be happy to show you our leather <unk> although the closest color to white that we carry would be the champagne 
 woman : okay let me see it 
 *i go around the <unk> <unk> and pull out the standard champagne leather bracelet 
 * woman : no that 's not the one i saw on the advertisement 
 me : i 'm sorry about that 
 do you remember how many times it wrapped around the wrist 
 we have the single and the double <unk> in this color 
 *i pull out the <unk> bracelet 
 * woman : no it was thick and it was white not champagne 
 me : like i said before we do n't carry our leather <unk> in the color white 
 they also only come in one standard <unk> 
 woman : this is <unk> 
 why would your advertisement lie 
 me : i 'm very sorry about that 
 may i ask where you saw the advertisement 
 woman : in insert name of large department store chain here 
 me : that department store is not qualified to sell our jewelry 
 you might have saw an ad for another brand 
 woman : i have known the owner of this store for 30 years and i will have you fired 
 <unk> <unk> quickly ... * me : you are free to talk to the owner about my performance 
 i 'm sorry that i could n't help you today 
 woman : you do not deserve this job 
 *my manager realizes what is happening and i step away 
 the woman had to be taken out of our store by security 
 * honestly did she think i was lying to her or something 
 also i spoke to the owner of the store and he said that she 's crazy and not to worry about her 
 <unk> it 's just so frustrating 
 edit : wow this blew up 
 i 'm checking in with you guys while on break 
 thanks for all the <unk> comments i was working my department when a couple of customers walked back and were browsing around 
 i had my arm pretty much up to my <unk> in a fish tank <unk> <unk> and smiled and nodded to the customers who were a little far to actually say hi to 
 from behind me i hear do you work here '' 
 in such a snotty tone that i was torn between being annoyed and impressed 
 <unk> back a <unk> 's your <unk> remark i turn around greet the woman confirm that i 'm not just some weird fish tank <unk> customer and answer her question about what to feed <unk> 
 she seemed satisfied with my answer and walked away without another word 
 i go off to make sure the other customers were finding everything okay 
 as i was in the middle of talking to another customer about the best <unk> for her new <unk> and what to feed it from behind me i hear <unk> perfect snotty tone interrupt me mid sentence with do we have to catch these fish ourselves '' 
 bitch please calm down aka * '' sorry about that ma'am be right with you and i 'll catch your fish 
 * after <unk> my <unk> customer was good i turn around and walk past snotty to get to the fish tanks and as soon as i walked past her <unk> myself in a full blown eye roll 
 only to notice a man staring 
 right 
 at 
 me 
 oops ... and then snotty walked up to him and it became clear he was her husband 
 double oops 
 i catch the woman her fish laying on the little southern girl <unk> even get her to laugh and by the end she thanked me and walked away happy 
 the entire time i was shooting nervous glances at the husband to try to gauge his reaction but he did n't seem to care about my reaction to his wife one way or the other 
 he never did say anything that i know of 
 maybe he knows who he <unk> tfr 
 my last story really had nothing to do with my job specifically but this one oh this one ... just happened a few hours ago and i 'll write it while it 's fresh on my mind 
 as i stated in my previous tale i work in the deli department of the big-box retailer in my town 
 we do <unk> trays vegetable sandwich you name it - we do it 
 now all trays no matter hot or cold we ask for at least 24 hours notice on orders so we can prepare the next day 's crew and get the cold trays for the next day out of the way 
 now onto the story 
 yesterday i took a lady 's order over the phone for a <unk> cheese tray let 's call the lady entitled <unk> or <unk> for short 
 now et was polite while i was taking her order very specific in what she wanted and was very grateful for taking her order and repeating it as we went along in our conversation 
 seemed like a nice enough lady assumed she 'd be an easy customer 
 fast forward to today 
 it was around 2 pm i was ready to go to lunch it 'd been a long day <unk> weekend and the last day of summer vacation here 
 the phone rings 
 my coworkers were <unk> with customers so i quickly answered 
 the conversation goes as follows : me : thank you for calling the redacted deli how may i help you today 
 et : hi i called for a tray yesterday and i was supposed to pick it up earlier and i 'm running a bit late 
 me : oh okay 
 what was the name on the order 
 et : <unk> 
 me : ah yes you ordered our <unk> cheese tray correct 
 et : yes ma'am 
 me : okay well what can i do for you 
 et : well i 'm running a bit behind today and i 'm on my way there right now i was wondering if there was any way you could take my tray to the customer service desk so i can just pay for it and go 
 <unk> : this was n't a problem 
 our deli is in the very back of our store and i honestly did n't feel any issue with running an order to the front for a customer 
 me : yes ma'am i can do that for you 
 if you will just call us when you arrive i or someone else can meet you at the service desk with your tray 
 et : oh well i was also going to see if you could pick up two cases of bottled water the store brand my balloons from the produce department oh and two medium sized <unk> on your way 
 me : ... excuse me 
 et : well i mean you 're going to pass all those things on your way to the service desk you might as well 
 me : well ma'am i 'm sorry but i ca n't do your shopping for you 
 et : ugh 
 well you 're bringing my tray up you might as well 
 me : at this point i 'm <unk> and <unk> to my <unk> that i 'm going to kill myself ma'am i apologize but we 're extremely <unk> and <unk> as it is and i 'm doing you a huge favor just taking your tray up front i really do n't want to take much more time than i can 
 at this point my manager can hear the <unk> in my voice 
 she stands beside me as i 'm arguing with this <unk> asshat 
 et : you 're <unk> me 
 i do n't have time to walk all over the store for those things 
 i need to speak to your manager right now young lady 
 i hand the phone over to my manager 
 now my manager is a <unk> lady 
 she 's yelled at customers for being rude to us before so i have no doubt in my mind this situation will be the same 
 i 'll call her badass manager or <unk> for short 
 <unk> : this is the <unk> deli manager how may i help you 
 all i can hear is yelling through the earpiece i heard a few stupid '' s and rude '' s in the mixture 
 maybe a lazy '' or two 
 <unk> : ma'am my employees are not your personal shoppers 
 now unless you are disabled my employees have no reason to do your shopping for you 
 <unk> was doing you a favor by <unk> to take your tray up front for you 
 but since you 've been nothing but rude you can walk back here and pick it up yourself 
 and with that she hung up on et 
 <unk> let me go to lunch to cool down i get pretty angry and quick <unk> could see it in my face that i was about to snap 
 the only thing my coworkers told me was that et was in no way disabled 
 she was in her mid to late 20s dressed as nice as they come with no obvious disabilities 
 they informed me that she just sheepishly asked for her tray and walked away 
 tl dr get your own <unk> groceries 
 for some time i worked in a college bookstore first as the assistant manager then later as the big cheese 
 this is a story from when i was the assistant 
 i came in just as the third keyholder opened the door and in his usual <unk> manner he said <unk> you look terrible '' 
 he was n't wrong i was n't feeling very well at all 
 however the store manager was in her <unk> month of pregnancy and had a <unk> care appointment that morning ... until she showed up i pretty much had no choice but to be there 
 i pulled up a seat at my desk grabbed a soda out of the beer fridge '' we had and began to open the mail from the past week 
 <unk> <unk> credit <unk> <unk> i have no idea what this is <unk> ... so on and so forth 
 after about 15 minutes of this i had this sudden feeling like my heart just tripped and fell down a flight of stairs bouncing off each one on the way 
 as if that was n't bad enough my <unk> rate shot through the roof and i felt *really* hot 
 i stood up and <unk> out of the store heading to the bathroom the whole time my heart going a mile a minute 
 i saw my face and immediately went back to the store slowly and carefully 
 getting back in i asked the <unk> opener to call 911 and i sat down on a nearby stool at the end of the counter 
 a few moments later i was handed the <unk> and i was being asked questions by the 911 <unk> 
 no i 'm not in pain 
 yes my heart is still <unk> 
 no i 'm not out of breath ... and on and on 
 fortunately the campus is about a mile from a hospital ... it only <unk> like it took forever for the emts to show up 
 one of the guys started to <unk> the stretcher unit while the other began to take my blood pressure and check my <unk> 
 then came the words i never thought i 'd ever hear in reference to myself : i cant get a <unk> '' 
 my heart was going so fast that the emt could n't count the individual beats ... oh and the <unk> was <unk> high as well 
 at this point i was having trouble standing up ... one emt took position on either side of me and we started to get me headed to the stretcher 
 and then i heard it 
 excuse me i need one of those snickers bars '' 
 yep right there was a <unk> pointing past me at the candy rack ... the rack the emts the stretcher and oh by the way i was in front of 
 my opener talked to her for a second as i laid back on the stretcher ... i assume saying something like it 'll be just a moment i do n't want to <unk> with a medical emergency '' or something along those lines 
 ... but i 'm late for class '' 
 the store manager was walking in as they were wheeling me out <unk> mask firmly <unk> on my face 
 i explained that i was going to take a sick day and they loaded me in the ambulance 
 once they hooked me up to the <unk> and <unk> and machines that go <unk> 
 my <unk> was <unk> and my <unk> was something like <unk> 
 why blood was n't <unk> out my <unk> i 'll never understand 
 as it turns out i have a birth defect that i 'll describe as an extra nerve in my heart ... when it fires my heart has a chance of going crazy 
 it 's not uncommon they told me later and most people wo n't ever know they have it 
 i was just lucky i guess 
 it has n't happened since 
 i do n't know if our customer got her snickers bar 
 edit : <unk> quote of the day 
 at least the customer was good for <unk> tfr long time lurker first time poster 
 i 'm a cashier at a popular discount grocery store i am an override cashier and have been around for 5 years 
 being on the edge of the low income area and a higher income area i get my fair share of crazy customers 
 my stories are <unk> 
 i worked yesterday on the express lane <unk> items and everything was going smoothly 
 it was such a beautiful day and i was in a really good mood 
 all my customers were sweet and that almost never happens 
 in the last hour of my shift i served a very cranky lady <unk> during a very very busy period at the grocery store 
 being on express my line is the longest and i have to move quickly 
 me : hi would you like a bag today 
 <unk> : ... *holds out handful of <unk> me : .. ok so that 's $ <unk> today please 
 customers do this all the time they ca n't be bothered to count out the money and i really do n't mind since i 'm pretty quick at it 
 she has a $ 10 and some change that will not add up to the $ <unk> on it 's own 
 so i take the $ 10 and $ <unk> count it back to her wait and then put it in my till and give her the $ 1 back 
 she waits until i 'm done to start yelling at me 
 <unk> : that 's not how i wanted to pay 
 i was a bit shocked at first since she was staring me down 
 almost did n't know what to say since she was holding the money in my face and never said a word me : <unk> how did you want to pay 
 <unk> : i wanted you to get a $ 5 bill 
 i have more change i want to get rid of 
 me : well i can still do that if you 'd like i just took what you handed me 
 i take her change and give her the $ 5 bill even though i did n't really have to just trying to make her happy 
 she rips the money out of my hand with a huff 
 me : would you like your receipt as well 
 <unk> : you should 've asked me if i had more change 
 what kind of cashier are you 
 i 've never ... at this point i have started with my next customer and really do n't want to stand there and take her crap anymore 
 so i cut her off me : ok you have a nice day 
 <unk> nice <unk> <unk> : i will not have a nice day 
 i could n't control myself at this point i paused and looked her dead in the eye trying so hard to hold it in but i could n't 
 i <unk> out laughing 
 i looked away knowing i just pissed her off more and did n't want her to start again that 's when i realized i was n't the only one laughing 
 my current customer and a couple others in the line were in stitches 
 by the time i looked back up she was already walking out of the store still complaining to herself 
 i tried my best to stay as professional as possible but i just could n't hold it in 
 tl dr ruined a women 's whole day because i ca n't read <unk> 've been working at a coffee chain in a food court for about 4 years and i 've had my fair share of regular customers come and go 
 our most common regulars are older folks whose best part of their day is coming out to the shopping centre where i work and getting their daily coffee 
 ever since i started this cute old european couple would come in <unk> every morning 
 the man was named <unk> and i never found out the name of his wife but they knew my name i believe my name tag was a <unk> 
 they would order 2 small <unk> in the round cups we changed our cup design about 2 years back but they preferred the old cups so we kept 2 aside for them 
 gradually i made the change from service to barista 
 <unk> would greet me <unk> every time he came in 
 <unk> 
 <unk> your coffee is the best '' 
 i 'm not the best with <unk> so i would proceed to blush profusely 
 as my coffee skills <unk> so did my coffee art 
 i would always make sure <unk> 's <unk> looked <unk> i ca n't help it i attend art school 
 hearts <unk> <unk> or when i screwed it up an <unk> bird 
 <unk> would go sit about 10 metres from the counter with his wife and when i 'd finish making my coffees i 'd gesture in his direction they 'd both look up excitedly and either <unk> or his lovely wife would come on over 
 the wife would always say in her thick european accent : your coffees 
 all i want to do is look at them 
 too good to drink haha '' 
 they 'd really appreciate it i really looked forward to seeing them whenever i was working 
 it was the least i could do 
 anyway a few months ago they were coming in less frequently 
 <unk> started sporting a hat 
 the hat was <unk> however i could tell he was hiding something 
 they were more grateful than ever for our service 
 they would say on more than one occasion how seeing us smile would make them feel happier inside even if there was <unk> around 
 it would brighten their days 
 that really meant a lot to me 
 especially as i could get some pretty shit people come in and treat me <unk> 
 i 'd ask <unk> how he was sincerely not just as a customer service reflex 
 i was worried he did n't look well 
 he was less cheery than usual 
 a lot less cheery 
 i 'd ask how are you and he 'd give me this shrug like <unk> what can you do about it 
 he was sick 
 we <unk> saw them less and less 
 while i was away overseas for about a month <unk> 's wife came in to the shop 
 she came in to tell us that <unk> had passed away 
 she was close to tears but managed to say his funeral was packed 
 not surprised he was a popular guy 
 my manager was working at the time and had to go around to the back because she too was on the verge of tears 
 i guess she did n't want to upset the wife any further 
 i think she 's too upset <unk> to come back to get coffee 
 the second round cup broke recently <unk> now there 's only one 
 **edit : ** thank you everyone for sharing similar stories 
 it has been a pleasure to read them albeit the <unk> 
 i believe with the older people especially it 's part of your job to look out for them 
 it 's always <unk> when they disappear out of the blue 
 come to think of it ... i have n't seen <unk> in a while ... **update : ** the wife came in today 
 she ordered 3 coffees for her and her 2 <unk> 
 nice to see her happy 
 she 's still using <unk> 's coffee card though it has his name on it <unk> 8 years i was a pharmacist in a very busy store with a super demanding clientele 
 the neighborhood is very wealthy and they tend to be the kind of wealthy that is convinced its constantly being <unk> by everyone 
 they expect a lot and they tend to be ungrateful even after they 've gotten it 
 needless to say while stressful the store provided me with lots of amusement in retrospect 
 today 's story begins when we have a <unk> come in to look at our water line the <unk> water we use to mix liquid <unk> 
 we have a suspended ceiling in the pharmacy and the water line is above it so the guy got up on a ladder and went into the ceiling 
 i have no idea what he was standing on up there but he lost his <unk> and fell face first right through the suspended ceiling onto the floor which is just <unk> <unk> over concrete 
 everything in the pharmacy stops as we have a bleeding <unk> man on the floor 
 my fellow pharmacist goes to assess the damage 
 i call 911. he 's not dead but he is out cold 
 we are walking distance from the fire station and the paramedics are there before you know it 
 5 minutes tops 
 while they are putting him on a stretcher i notice the phone ringing and i pick it up 
 i need you to page my doctor at the hospital right now '' 
 it 's the middle of the day 
 we generally do n't page during the day 
 plus with current events being what they are i am a bit flustered 
 you want me to page him why '' 
 it 's an emergency 
 and i was on hold for fifteen minutes '' 
 this is <unk> 
 but i still apologize 
 i 'm sorry sir but things are crazy here 
 we just had a guy fall through the ceiling 
 the paramedics are here '' 
 is he an employee '' 
 i am baffled but answer yes '' 
 then he does n't matter 
 i 'm a customer i 'm more important '' 
 yes honest to god the guy actually said that 
 are you going to page my doctor or what '' 
 now i am really flabbergasted 
 um sure 
 give me the number where i can reach him '' 
 he does 
 what am i calling for '' 
 he 'll know 
 i 'll be there in 15 minutes to pick it up '' 
 and he hangs up 
 by now the <unk> is on his way to the hospital and my manager is <unk> up the blood on the <unk> which never came completely clean 
 i <unk> the phone conversation to my co-workers who all decide this guy is the biggest asshole ever 
 then i dutifully page his doctor at the hospital 
 the <unk> i got was the icing on the cake 
 his emergency '' was for <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> by the way was more or less okay but he did end up with a broken nose and a <unk> used to work loss prevention for a large retail clothing store that sells very popular jeans 
 so one afternoon i 'm sitting in my office watching our cameras when i see someone slightly suspicious going in and out of the men 's dressing room every few minutes 
 i walk over to get a better look at what he is doing 
 as i 'm on my way over the fire alarms go off 
 well crap i get on the radio and start telling employees where to post then go to the fire control <unk> to see what alarm is going off 
 a smoke <unk> had <unk> but it did not say where 
 everyone else has been cleared the building by this time except two people two people that refuse to exit a stall in the men 's fitting room 
 i get annoyed and finally tell them to come out now or i 'm coming in 
 they walk out <unk> past me and toss a pair of jeans back into the pile as they move toward the door 
 the fitting room floor wall bench all covered in blue security ink odd 
 i walk over and inspect the jeans security tag melted jeans ruined 
 i get up front just as they are walking into the parking lot and going for their vehicle fortunately the police showed up with the fire department i hold up the jeans to an officer and point towards them 
 <unk> with a security device destruction of property and something about use of <unk> in an occupied <unk> 
 needless to say they both left in the back of a cop car 
 though had they just tried to steal the jeans and got caught they only would 've had a minor <unk> and been free to go 
 i caught a female customer red shoplifting last night in the gas station i manage 
 we have an electronic ordering system for our deli that prints tickets which the customer uses to be rung up with at the register while they 're waiting for us to make their food 
 if it does n't get rung up it 'll sit in the resume sale button until it 's rung up or until i delete it 
 it 's 2 am and red shows up and orders food 
 we 're in a bit of a rush at the moment so i 'm in the deli helping out my associate 
 she <unk> for her food and drops the slip she used to pay for it in the basket 
 but she picked up three different orders ... we were busy and i 'm not allowed to demand '' the customer show me their paid slip before giving them the food 
 well red left so i go up to the register to she if the other two orders were payed for they were n't 
 at this point the she 's gone already so there is n't anything i can do 
 all i can do is wait for her to come back and watch her like a fucking <unk> 
 it 's now <unk> am and red actually came back to the store she just <unk> from 
 she grabs a couple <unk> and i make sure i 'm ringing her up my register associate noticed something was up because i kinda cut her off to the register so i 'd be the one to ring up red 
 me : that 'll be $ <unk> red : that 's pretty expensive for a couple <unk> me : i also rung up the <unk> you did n't pay for and the <unk> and cheese bowl you did n't pay for earlier 
 red : ... <unk> you sure i did n't pay for that 
 me : completely 
 if it was paid for i would n't be able to resume the ticket from the register for the same order number you had with the same order you ordered 
 red : i 'm going to kill him 
 why did n't he pay for it i 'll go get him 
 me : if you leave before paying i 'm going to call the cops for shoplifting i already had my fuel associate write down your tags 
 red : fine 
 she payed with a hundred dollar bill 
 and she was clearly a <unk> we get them all the time 
 normally i do n't get <unk> like this 
 we are n't technically allowed to confront shoplifters 
 i 'm supposed to just call the cops and give all the information to them 
 but that does n't ever pan out and it does n't feel <unk> <unk> 
 i apologize if this is n't very retail '' but seeing as there is n't an <unk> i 'm just going to post this story here 
 background : long time lurker new account just to post this etc 
 etc 
 the usual 
 professional background : i work at a major credit card company in one of their national call <unk> 
 i deal with at least 50 people every day 8 hours a day 5 days a week 
 you 'd think dealing with so many customers and after being on the job for 2 years now that i 'd have had something <unk> to tell you all 
 alas no 
 but then there was a guy who i 'm going to call bob 
 this call happened yesterday friday afternoon 
 bob calls in to <unk> about his bill 
 sure of course 
 my name is call center <unk> and i will be your account manager today 
 can i get your first and last name address etc 
 okay one moment sir while i look up that information and pull up your account 
 bob : make it <unk> snappy '' 
 <unk> okay then 
 call center <unk> me : hi bob 
 thank you for waiting 
 how can i assist you with your account today '' 
 bob : yeah okay i was on your website and it says here my <unk> is $ <unk> 
 can you tell me why this is '' 
 all of my what 
 <unk> : yes sir 
 i 'm seeing here that your total balance due for this month comes to $ <unk> 
 this is the amount you have spent on the card 
 your minimum payment due by may 30 is $ <unk> '' 
 bob goes silent for at least 15 seconds 
 then bob flips ripping me a new one 
 bob : what 
 what do you mean <unk> and <unk> payment 
 i was told when i signed up for this crap that it was free for the first 12 months '' 
 even more of my what 
 i get to the bottom of this and it turns out bob 's credit agreement is our standard <unk> 0 % interest promotion 
 it 's <unk> not <unk> 
 <unk> boy 
 bob is <unk> 
 bob : oh my god 
 oh my god 
 cancel the card 
 cancel it now 
 i was <unk> and lied to 
 your company has <unk> me '' 
 standard call center procedure is to apologize to the customer even though it 's not our fault he 's an idiot and explain to him what he needs to do before we can cancel the card you know pay the balance 
 bob : well okay 
 my wife is in charge of all the finances so i 'll just let her deal with this 
 thanks for nothing '' 
 <unk> : have a wonderful day sir '' 
 people man 
 people 
 edit : so i just noticed that there 's an <unk> 
 <unk> on a very busy monday a lady in her 50 's comes in to my big box store to process a return 
 the store is located 50 miles from the canadian border so we get loads of them in to get their discounted prices 
 this particular canadian lady cl comes in with a $ 50 itunes card demanding a refund because it did n't work in canada 
 the pin was scratched off and the card was worn out 
 me : sorry ma'am this receipt is from over a year ago our return policy is 30 days 
 cl : i live in canada and i was told there would be no issue making returns past your policy 
 me : do you have <unk> of this interaction 
 cl : ... no me : sorry there 's nothing i can do 
 you could maybe call itunes and ask to have it transferred to a canadian account 
 cl : yeah you should get that done for me on your computer since you sold me an <unk> card 
 it clearly states <unk> in us only me : i do n't work for apple ... cl : but you 're <unk> large <unk> 
 surely you can call someone directly to do it ... me : no ma'am that 's not possible 
 is there anything else i can help you with today 
 <unk> away ... <unk> tfr 
 for some background i 'm an associate in a place that sells clothes 
 we all know how slow it is right now 
 so in the land of <unk> today i got given an unexpected surprise by my manager : i 'm training you on cash today '' 
 <unk> i was surprised 
 internally i was <unk> with <unk> 
 cashiers have more hours than associates 
 i 'm like alright cool '' 
 so off i go 
 get all set up watch the head cash <unk> do her thing and i get my first customer as a cashier ever 
 i really wish i could have a <unk> 
 she was ... how do i describe her 
 like someone <unk> <unk> and <unk> threw in a heavy dose of <unk> and <unk> it nicely with a <unk> of <unk> and hatred 
 definitely on the older side and definitely someone i will likely see again 
 our registers are all in a line 
 people are lined up using those things like theaters have to act as ropes in a <unk> 
 i call 'good evening 
 to the woman next 
 well this woman who i 'm calling retail demon rd cut through a line of six by going under these ropes and straight to my register 
 she threw her purchase on the counter and snapped hurry up i have n't got all day '' 
 now i have no idea what to do 
 the other girl <unk> is busy doing an exchange a few tills away 
 other customers are stunned 
 i decide to just get her out of there 
 flashing a quick <unk> look to the woman who went next i began to scan her items 
 a couple of tank tops and <unk> 
 beside the register we have lip <unk> lip <unk> nail files and <unk> jewelry 
 on an <unk> insane bitch grabs one of each colour 
 six in all 
 okay fine 
 problem : they 're not scanning 
 so i have to manually enter them 
 rd : what 's taking so long 
 why does this place have such incompetent employees '' 
 me : i 'm sorry i need to enter these manually 
 the bar codes are n't scanning '' 
 rd : do n't you lie to me 
 i know you 're trying to <unk> me out of more money 
 i 'll be checking the receipt when you 're done '' 
 okay wow 
 um did n't realize six one dollar <unk> were so important 
 eventually this gets done- with <unk> and demands to hurry up '' 
 as i 'm scanning the tank tops i remember i need to tell her the policy 
 me : alright ma'am for the tank tops you <unk> '' rd : do n't you <unk> me you fat <unk> 
 i 'm not old how dare you 
 it 's not like you have anything important to say to me anyways '' 
 me : i 'm trying to explain <unk> '' rd : what did i just say 
 i demand to see a manager 
 <unk> 
 ** she was just <unk> at me 
 our mod was across the store and our sm was on a conference call in the back 
 i started shaking at this point 
 luckily <unk> jumped in at this point 
 she radioed our mod and told me to step back and let her handle it 
 the radio was n't required : rd could be heard clear across the store 
 i was freaking out thinking i 'd be written up or worse 
 then i remembered : the mod was the <unk> who did n't put up with anything 
 mod to me : <unk> what happened '' 
 rd : your incompetent <unk> '' mod to rd : i 'll speak to you when i 'm done '' 
 to me what 's going on '' 
 me : this woman cut through the line and threw her stuff down when i called someone over 
 i panicked and thought it best just to do the transaction 
 she grabbed her lip <unk> and i had to manually enter them 
 the yelling occurred when i went to explain policy '' 
 <unk> : you <unk> '' mod : to rd i 'm not done yet 
 you can wait '' 
 to me go on '' 
 me : i 've been trying to be helpful and have been snapped at to <unk> up more than once 
 when she screamed <unk> radioed you to come here 
 she was helping someone with an exchange '' 
 mod : thank you 
 you can work in your section now '' 
 i go off but not before i watch her void the transaction and tell her you insulted and berated an employee on her very first day 
 even if she was my most veteran cashier i 'd still be saying this : get out of my store and do n't come back '' 
 i can hear rd screaming across the store <unk> but let my mod handle it 
 she let me take my 10 early and told me next time tell her politely to go back to her spot 
 if she refuses radio one of us and we 'll come help you 
 okay '' 
 i nodded then she smiled 
 you 'll be okay 
 i promise that almost never happens here '' 
 the rest of the shift was spent between being an associate and on the register 
 i did n't have a single problem after <unk> everyone else understood 
 some of them were quite nice about it even 
 but i will never forget this so long as i live in this form 
 *edit : * i did n't expect this to blow up 
 wow 
 i 'm very touched by how many people feel i 'm lucky to have the manager i have 
 i wish all managers were like her 
 i 'd also like to say thank you for all the support 
 all of you are amazing i 'm <unk> at a <unk> for the summer and one day a week i work the front desk 
 during that <unk> <unk> i am the only person who is on two main floors and often the only staff member in the whole place 
 my bosses are wonderful people with a sense of humor and always back me 100 % in whatever i need to do 
 it 's basically a resort town filled with upper middle to upper class tourists in the summer mostly from <unk> who are some of the most self entitled people i 've ever met in my life 
 i have tons of examples and this is just one of them 
 it was a particularly slow day before the season really started so it was nearly noon before the first guests came in 
 i 'd been chatting with one of our <unk> who thankfully served as witness to the whole thing 
 a group of nine came in and i immediately knew there was going to be trouble 
 there was just a way that they was looking down their noses at everything 
 those are always the problem ones 
 the obvious leader was a <unk> year old woman dressed to the <unk> like she was some sort of <unk> 
 i launched into my normal greeting 
 good afternoon how are you 
 would you like to <unk> the <unk> today '' 
 she looked at me like i was the lowest <unk> of dirt on her $ 400 shoes 
 yes you do n't have to take that attitude 
 we are going to <unk> the <unk> and it will be free '' 
 i was a little shocked 
 the <unk> who 's been <unk> since the 80 's said we have free weekends once every couple of months but other than that there is an <unk> fee 
 it 's very small and it goes to help further education for the local area '' 
 faux <unk> lady <unk> yes but <unk> will get in for free you understand 
 do you have anyone more <unk> to give a <unk> miss '' 
 this is our only <unk> for the day and if you would like to go further than the front desk you all will have to pay an <unk> fee unless you are active duty military a <unk> member or under the age of 6 '' 
 no we wo n't because *we <unk> get in <unk> 
 we are special guests of the director '' 
 she was completely certain i was going to <unk> and the polo <unk> clan of family she had with her was <unk> around like they were trying to physically intimidate me 
 if you are a special guest i have to approve that through the director of the <unk> 
 let me just call him '' 
 as i grabbed the phone she continued talking to be like the was <unk> with a deaf <unk> 
 my boss said he 'd be up in a few seconds and i held them off just wandering into the building by showing them greeting cards 
 there was a <unk> benefit going on that night after hours and some of the guys were there setting up 
 so trailing just behind our <unk> director were two young large <unk> there to help move things in the front hall 
 i presented the group as the director 's special guests '' 
 the director was very friendly shaking their hands 
 they kept glancing at me with this look in their eyes like they 'd won 
 finally the director said with a big smile on his face not losing a beat from his friendly <unk> please leave 
 you have had your opportunity to visit with us and you have <unk> it 
 we welcome you to come back another day possibly a free family weekend 
 have a lovely day '' 
 then he went back downstairs leaving me with two large <unk> making a wall <unk> them from going further inside 
 faux <unk> lady huffed then stormed out yelling something about being the ruin of all of us 
 the <unk> brought the <unk> and i sweet tea and <unk> as thanks for a great story 
 it was delicious
