 i work as a manager at a small chain of <unk> <unk> locations i am putting away my main order of the week when a woman comes in asking for a nutrageous bar i told her with a smile we had some right in front of the store as i pointed right to a blank spot on the shelf 
 turns out we had sold out over the weekend and i had just broken this poor woman 's heart and shattered her dreams with false hope 
 she had been searching <unk> for weeks and could n't find one anywhere 
 i apologized for the bad fortune and said i would order more straight away the woman sighed <unk> her head and walked out of the store like a <unk> puppy 
 i turned back to the order opened the tub and right on top was a brand new box of nutrageous bars 
 i tear open the box and vault over the counter like a bad ass cop sliding over a car hood sprinting out the door like i had just clocked out 
 i caught up to her just as she starts to pull away from my store and from happiness most likely on her way to jump off a bridge hoping to find a nutrageous bar waiting for her in the next life 
 she turned and saw me <unk> towards her holding the candy bar like a newborn child i had just delivered into this world i had never seen someone so happy over a candy she runs to me like she was a veteran returning home from duty and running towards their children for that first <unk> embrace 
 i tell her to have it on the house and have a good day 
 then just now i get a call from my district manager demanding to know if i was the one who gave away a candy bar to a customer for free 
 fuck '' 
 i think to myself i do something nice for someone and this goddamn bitch calls my boss to tell on me 
 so i tell my boss yeah it was me 
 he tells me that she called and was so happy with our company she would be choosing us for the local volunteer fire <unk> <unk> gifts this year 
 $ 2,000 in gift cards $ 25 each for the <unk> 
 my boss says he is giving me a 10 % commission for the gift cards 
 minus the price of a nutrageous bar 
 so i work at a pet store my family owns it 
 we do boarding daycare training grooming and retail 
 i had a regular come in a few months back he was n't doing to well financial since becoming disabled 
 he brought in his dog for grooming and i noticed he had large amount of <unk> i called and informed him 
 i let him know that i would give his other dog a flea bath for cheap so he could take care of it 
 once he got there he tried to pay with a care credit card that the state had given him 
 unfortunately we do n't take that card 
 so he gave me his card information so i could charge him when he got paid 
 i sent with him with some flea and tick <unk> we sell over the counter 
 well the day came for me to run his card he called me to remind me 
 i thanked him got off the phone and did n't charge him 
 today he called realizing he had n't been charged i told him i did n't plan on charging him and was happy to be able to help 
 he could n't talk for a bit trying to compose himself 
 i got off the phone knowing i had made someone 's day better 
 i know how hard it can be living on disability my mom is on it 
 sometimes even the littlest of things can help.a mother just came into my very small retail store with her three <unk> kids 
 normally this <unk> disaster 
 however these kids each had a couple of $ 20 's and <unk> looked through the items in the store before selecting something bringing it up to the register buying it with the money from their pockets and being extremely polite 
 as they left the register the mom told the kids make sure you save your receipts so we can budget tonight '' 
 one of the kids replied i always keep my receipts '' in the most polite way possible 
 good on that mom for teaching her kids the value of money and financial planning 
 just wanted to share because unlike most of the dross that comes through they made my day genuinely better afternoon <unk> 
 long time lurker first time poster you know the drill right 
 this is the most exciting tfr story i 've got 
 this was back in ... i want to say 2005 
 before the <unk> of smartphones etc 
 it 's about the time i worked at a gas <unk> store for one whole day and ended up as a manager and a district manager 's worst nightmare 
 i 'd taken the job not two days before and was told to show up at seven am on a monday for training 
 no big deal right 
 the manager tm certainly seemed <unk> enough at the time but i suppose that 's what they say about all the crazies 
 so 
 i show up at 7am bright eyed and <unk> <unk> and ready to get to work 
 i 'm immediately introduced to the young lady yl who 's been <unk> with training me by tm 
 tm spends the first twenty minutes of my shift not training me but ranting and rambling about how she just worked a double graveyard and how she 's <unk> and how this place just sucks her dry ... you get the idea 
 then she <unk> that yl 's going to be with me all day training me step by step and is then gone in a puff of smoke 
 gone home to get some <unk> sleep 
 leaves her home number on a <unk> of paper behind the counter in case of <unk> only '' 
 sensible enough 
 so we get down to business 
 yl 's shocked that i 'm already somewhat <unk> and computer-literate and so takes the opportunity to <unk> me in the backroom doing a few hours of computer training that i gather is supposed to <unk> the entirety of my day 
 when i finish my computer training i step out into the main store area to be relieved of duty 
 yl instead informs me that we 're now going to do some hands-on training 
 ... weird ... but fine ... i guess ... i mean i 'm not going to scoff at a few extra hours on my paycheck so whatever 
 let 's do some hands on work 
 the hands-on work goes on for about an hour and a half bringing my day to about four and a half hours at this point 
 until yl pulls me aside and announces with a beaming shit-eating grin on her face & gt yl : you know what 
 i think yeah 
 i think fuck this place 
 & gt cib : fuck this place 
 & gt yl : yeah man fuck it 
 it 's bullshit anyway 
 fuck everything 
 i quit 
 & gt cib : like in two weeks 
 & gt yl : like i mean like now 
 & gt cib : ... what 
 with that she tears off her smock lights a cigarette and walks out of the joint leaving me to mind the store alone 
 i do n't know how to do cash drops i do n't know how to do most of this shit 
 i 've been here for *four hours tops 
 * you must be kidding me 
 yl locks the door to the back room shoves the key underneath the door and is gone forever 
 so like the nice young man i am i call tm 's emergency number 
 the phone rings and rings and rings for maybe two minutes straight before she finally answers <unk> with a <unk> & gt tm : ... <unk> 
 i promptly explain the situation to her and tell her that i need help 
 she tells me to hold tight and that she 's going to call her assistant manager am to come and help 
 you know where this is going 
 am never comes 
 i 'm waiting for another two hours and am never shows up 
 i call tm back 
 same deal 
 two minutes of continuous ringing 
 she promises something else 
 hangs up on me 
 we go through this process four more times over the course of two more hours when the next person <unk> is due to show up anyway 
 he never shows 
 naturally 
 so i call tm until she finally just *takes her phone off the hook so i ca n't call her anymore 
 * this is the part of the story where i start to freak out 
 i have no other numbers 
 i know no one else who works here 
 i am alone 
 no way to clock out no way to hide no way to lock the doors nothing 
 just work 
 only work 
 forever and ever and ever and ever 
 i can see that this is how i die i 'm sure of it 
 i 'm in a really shitty boring version of *final destination 
 * at this point i feel the need to call out the dudes who ran the tattoo shop across the street 
 they 'd been coming in for <unk> and energy drinks and such throughout the day and had taken a keen interest in my <unk> 
 they were pretty up '' on the situation and kept me reasonably calm throughout the day they noticed that i was starting to freak out 
 asked me what the situation was 
 i explained 
 just like that these badasses jump into action : they bring me their phonebook with all the numbers of the other stores in the area circled and they go to the local taco cart and get me a plate of tacos and a coke to keep my strength up '' 
 i 'm not into dudes but i considered asking these guys to <unk> me then and there 
 <unk> by tacos and sheer <unk> panic i start making calls 
 other stores are shocked by what 's happened but do n't have anyone to spare 
 they 've got no one 
 but 
 one of them gives me the district manager 's dm home number 
 <unk> 
 i explained the situation to him and listened as he went from perfectly congenial to absolutely terrified 
 he tells me & gt dm : i 'm coming down there to personally relieve you from your shift ... but then he says the perfect combination of words to set me off : & gt dm : ... but i 'm going to need about an hour and a half 
 is that okay 
 welcome to my breaking point 
 i begin to shout and shout and shout 
 & gt cib : no that is *not alright 
 * tell you what dm - either you get down here in half an hour or i am going to open the cash registers the safe turn the gas pumps on <unk> run and **go home 
 ** is that what you want 
 free gas and free money for everyone who comes into the store until there 's no more money 
 **is that what you want 
 ** & gt dm : ... i 'll be there in twenty minutes 
 i now see what has happened : i have officially been taken hostage by this store and have taken it hostage in return 
 i am now the crazy person in the situation 
 i 'm the movie bad guy 
 i 'm the one making demands 
 but you know what 
 he got there in fifteen minutes flat 
 and you know what 
 he was very nice all said and told 
 he apologized profusely even helped me *actually kick in* the locked backroom door so i could clock out all <unk> 
 it 's <unk> 
 finally 
 but then tm in her pajamas eyes bloodshot and wild murderous and back from the dead like the last bad guy in <unk> <unk> comes storming into the store screaming at dm who had apparently gotten her to answer her phone during his trip over : & gt tm : dm how <unk> <unk> you tell me how to run *my store* i swear to *fuck* you 've been telling me what to do for <unk> long now* and i am telling you for the last time -- dm turns to me as tm is shrieking and he says something that makes me start laughing like a <unk> 
 & gt dm : go home cib 
 i 've got this 
 shit you do n't have to tell me twice <unk> 
 i 'm gone 
 when i get to the door finally he calls after me and says : & gt dm : i really hope this does n't affect your future with the company 
 i never went back 
 edit : holy shit my very first gold 
 thanks anonymous internet patron 
 i 'm sincerely glad i could provide some laughs through my suffering 
 you beautiful bastard whoever you are 
 edit2 : hot damn you guys sure know how to make a dude feel loved 
 did n't expect this to take off 
 thanks for the kind words all well most 
 i love this subreddit 
 you 're all <unk> was working drive thru and this man pulls up to the second window for me to give him his food 
 he has the cutest little baby boy in the back seat so of course after the greetings and handing off the food i said hi to the baby 
 he had been staring intently at me and when i said hi he immediately starts laughing and waving 
 he was just the cutest thing 
 his dad turned around and looked at him and said son you 're too young to be flirting 
 stop it '' 
 me : <unk> honey i 'm sorry but i have a boyfriend 
 if you were like 15 years older you could fight him for me but right now i think he 'd crush you 
 and so we shared a laugh he left and i continued on with my work 
 about an hour later they return 
 the dad : oh he insisted on coming back to see you 
 *turns around and says to his <unk> now remember no more flirting because she has a boyfriend 
 the baby just laughed and waved his chubby little arms around 
 it was a good day 
 edit : to clarify they returned for more food 
 edit 2 : the first time they came through was for a smoothie the second time was for another smoothie a cheeseburger and some fries 
 i do n't think they expected me again but that 's what they got so the father tried to make it into a joke 
 i thought it was a cute story and decided to share 
 <unk> edit 3 : oh wow 
 post became very popular 
 even the boyfriend found it 
 thanks <unk> edit : oh wow 
 reddit gold 
 thank you kind stranger 
 <unk> worked as a bagger at a small family owned grocery store while i was in high school 
 one day a man came through the checkout with a full cart of groceries 
 & gt me : paper or plastic '' 
 & gt customer : <unk> like double bagged paper and i’d like you to make each bag as heavy as you <unk> & gt me : sure thing '' 
 a bit of a strange request sure but anything that broke up the <unk> of the day was welcomed 
 i managed to load his entire cart into three fairly heavy bags and bring them out to his car 
 & gt customer : in case you 're wondering - i just had a fight with the wife and it 's my turn to pick up the groceries '' 
 & gt me : <unk> '' 
 & gt customer : it 's also her turn to unload the car 
 so way back in college i worked a summer job flying a register for a grocery store 
 this chain had a policy with your <unk> card if there was an x-number on the back you could cash checks at our stores and cashiers could use that number as an id on checks for buying groceries 
 if it had a y-number then it was just a card that someone had and had almost no information on file 
 it 's my last shift before i go back to school 
 i 'm standing at this register counting down the last half hour when this woman rolls up with a big cart full of stuff 
 i get started beep beep beep and give her the total 
 she hands me a check with a y-number written on it 
 i ask to see her card thinking maybe she 's just written it wrong 
 nope it 's a y-number 
 me : ma'am do you have your drivers license with you 
 her : no i do n't have it 
 me : okay well i ca n't take this check 
 her : it 's got a y-number on it 
 me : i know i ca n't take the check if it has a y-number only if it has an x-number 
 her : every other cashier always has 
 me : they should n't have 
 i 'd lose my job if i took this 
 that was my go-to answer to someone trying to pull this crap on me 
 her : starts screaming then you can go put all this back yourself or you can take my damn check 
 now i 'm twenty minutes from being done here 
 the managers love me they think i 'm funny they 're actually not happy i 'm leaving 
 so i figure well let 's just have some fun with this 
 so i whip off my vest throw it on the floor and scream back 
 me : do n't talk to me like that i quit 
 i storm off to the office take a seat and one of the managers looks at me confused 
 i ask him to go out and talk to the woman at register 2 who 's still standing there with her mouth hanging open 
 he came back a few minutes later smiling 
 me : how 'd that go 
 manager : well i told her you were right and that she had just cost my best cashier 
 i 'm a cart pusher and i do n't deal with tons of customers 
 i did have a woman flip out and call me an idiot but honestly i feel this was worse 
 i saw these two girls probably <unk> years old putting their cart up on the curb instead of a corral 
 i went over and said i would take it 
 what does one of them do 
 she shoves the cart so it rolls full speed and i have to run after it while they stand there watching me laughing at me 
 one of them said haha you really did that '' 
 to the one who shoved the cart 
 i was embarrassed and felt hurt by this 
 it ruined my night that they decided to just make a joke out of me and my job 
 i am trying to feel better about it thinking they are super immature but this still was hurtful 
 : edit : thank you all so much for making me feel better about this guys 
 : also got my first gold 
 my night has got a lot better thanks to you 
 it means a lot to me 
 edit 2 : this is crazy <unk> gold 
 i am overwhelmed by the reaction you guys have given me for this 
 thank you so much 
 i have to go to work again but i will continue responding to messages when i get home 
 : i was working a late shift and it was rather quiet 
 i had only been working at the store for only 5 months or so 
 a man came through my line and he was about 6 foot tall covered in tattoos and not the nicely made tattoos you see from a good tattoo shop i mean the kind that looks like he had them done in the <unk> of a <unk> biker bar type 
 he was heavy built and wore a leather biker vest 
 he did not seem the type to feel guilty about <unk> you on the street 
 he bought a few items but had beer 
 i of course id him and he shows it to me and i total everything 
 he pulls out a check book and writes a check 
 the check had a basket of kittens on it and this seemed like one of those facebook posts of bikers look mean but have a heart of gold type things 
 well i look at the check his name is nowhere on the check 
 it has a girls name on it and i tell him that i could not accept it because it is not his check and does not have his name 
 he claims the girl is with him and he would go get her real quick 
 he leaves and left the check on the counter 
 as soon as he is out of sight i call for a manager and they take the check and what i did not know was that about half an hour before an amber alert was released and being the fact this was about 11 years ago very few people had sms alerts for things like this and only because our company is a certified safe place we receive faxes which had amber alerts and such 
 the manager recognized the name and contacted police 
 minutes later we had a few cops show up and they asked me what the guy looked like and everything said 
 they even finger printed the stuff the guy was buying 
 security gave them the footage of the guy and were lucky to get the guys plate number 
 a few minutes later all the cops left and i mean in a hurry 
 apparently the guy was spotted and pulled over they found the girl tied up in the back of the suv he was driving and luckily she was not hurt 
 she was <unk> from where she worked after school and her co-worker called the cops when he got back from his break to find the place a mess and her missing 
 the whole thing occured within an hour and half time 
 she was taken to a local hospital where she was kept just in case over night 
 the man was of course <unk> cell phone format apology here 
 so i work in a store where we use short range radios with headsets to communicate with each other 
 it 's a huge help to us and helps us be more efficient 
 earlier today my boss sends me next door to the grocery store to buy donuts for the crew 
 while i 'm waiting in line a young boy maybe <unk> is shooting daggers at me 
 i 'm wearing my sunglasses inside with my earpiece still in as well 
 as i 'm leaving he yells to grab my attention 
 here 's the convo we had : little kid lc : hey 
 me : uhh yeah 
 lc : whats that for 
 pointing to my ear piece by now i know where this is going me : i cross my arms i use it for work lc : come here i have another question 
 mom looks at me with an eye roll because her kid is eccentric and that seems to <unk> her 
 not me weird kids always give me a laugh 
 i bend down to his level to hear then he whispers : lc : do you work for the government 
 me : i put my finger over my ear piece eagle this is <unk> 
 cover blown 
 i repeat eagle our cover us blown 
 then i take me and my donuts and run out of the store as fast as possible while the mom is dying of laughter and the kids jaw is on the ground because he just met a secret agent 
 highlight of my day edit : i did not use my secret agent authority to commandeer those donuts 
 he grabbed my attention after i paid and was getting ready to walk <unk> let me first off explaining about how my store manager looks to most people he is 6'3 '' so he is tall and seems very intimidating but different from his looks he is actually a very nice guy and this was how i learned what kind of guy he was 
 i had only been working for about 7 months at the store and this woman walked in with two little kids 
 one was about 2 years and the other was 5 years ago 
 there mother looked scared her hair was a mess and looked like she had no sleep in days she looked rough 
 well she walks up to me and asked to see the store manager so i call for him 
 i was working check out that day so it was pretty slow compared to others so i had breathers between the customers and i over heard the woman talking to him 
 she escaped her husband who was abusive and lived in the neighboring town she had gotten an apartment with the help of a friend of hers but she had nothing to eat and she asked him for help 
 the store manager told her to go fill a buggy with food and to come to my line when she was done and told her to get herself and her children some hot food from the deli also 
 so she left and about half an hour later she came to my line and i called him back he showed up and told me to ring it up like normal and then he pulled out his wallet and paid for the womans cart 
 then he asked me to come to his office and asked her to wait there 
 he said he wanted me to help take things to her car and to give her a paper he was writing on 
 so he handed me the paper and i walked her to her car 
 then handed her the paper he had given me to hand her 
 she started crying and i asked her if she was ok she handed me the paper 
 it basically was a note telling her he was sorry for her position and if she needed a job to help her to get by that she could show up in a couple of days and told her if she needed child care he had his number on there to call him and he would help set it up for her 
 needless to say she showed up and she is a very nice person who still works at our store 
 this is one of the many reasons why i love the store i work at and i believe i have the best store manager in the <unk> of you may recognize this story since i posted it before elsewhere but again this is the perfect sub for it 
 and it 's a happy story 
 we all like happy stories 
 this story starts long ago in the <unk> ages when bear and <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> 
 or about 2004 which ever you prefer 
 i was working at a sporting <unk> store at the time at the customer service counter 
 a father and his son who appeared to be about 11 came in and asked where the camping equipment was 
 i pointed them towards the two areas that held our camping merch and was about to go about doing something else boring when the boy piped up i 'm going on my first boy scout <unk> '' 
 now if you 've read my other stories you 'll know that i 'm an eagle scout 
 i take this position very seriously and will do everything in my power to encourage and help young <unk> on their trail to eagle 
 so i looked over at my boss a nice lady who hired me because of my outdoor experience in scouting and asked if i could go help these people personally 
 she smiled and said yes 
 the father was completely out of his element with camping gear 
 by his attitude and behavior i would guess that he had never gotten further out of the city limits than a highway in his life 
 everything in the aisle perplexed him but thankfully his son 's troop had given them a list of what equipment they 'd need 
 so for about 20 minutes or so i went through the list with them point by point explaining what each thing was what it did what version to use and how <unk> tape is the scout term for toilet paper 
 that got quite a bit of laughter 
 during this time i also talked with the kid 
 he was very new to scouting only having joined a couple months prior 
 he was <unk> about getting to go out into the <unk> and camp and make campfires and fish and all the other activities he 'd heard about 
 i talked about my experiences in scouting which was all of what he was talking about and so much more 
 climbing mt hood going to national <unk> <unk> military <unk> rafting down the <unk> the kid was very impressed 
 i kept telling him this is only the start you have no idea how awesome it can get '' 
 so we finally have a cart filled with a small tent sleeping bag cooking equipment small first aid kit <unk> backpack rope you and <unk> fuckin rope <unk> water bottle etc etc etc 
 quite a haul but i 'd done my best to get everything that the kid would need while still keeping things cheap 
 well cheap-ish 
 the total was something like a bit over $ 200 
 now they say that a picture is worth a thousand words but if i could have taken a picture of the dad 's face when the total came up it would be worth a much longer essay 
 it was a <unk> combination that said damn i did n't expect it to be this much 
 but he 's so excited i ca n't tell him no it would break his heart 
 maybe if i just eat <unk> for the next couple weeks i can afford this '' 
 as dad reached reluctantly for his wallet i flashed him a smile looked at my boss and knocked 20 % off the total 
 a scout is helpful and kind '' i quoted 
 the father thanked me profusely as did the son 
 they left with a spring in their step and smiles on their faces 
 my boss said that was very nice but do n't ever do that again '' 
 i replied but boss you do realized that from now on they are going to be in here on a regular basis to buy camping equipment right 
 i know that kid 's look he 's just like me at that age and he 's going to be spending a lot of dad 's money here '' 
 she laughed agreed and the deed was put out of my mind as other customers approached 
 but the story is n't done yet dear reader 
 for about a week later look who comes running through the door but our little first-time camper with dad trailing along 
 this kid very specifically wanted to see me because he had pictures and he wanted to show them to me 
 <unk> sweet 
 sure let 's take a look ... hey i know this camp 
 i know exactly where you were 
 so we talked about being at that camp and taking the hike down the hill to the old camp location and how the fishing in the lake is and the deer that just do n't care that you are around and how the <unk> hall seems to be made mostly of sieves given how <unk> it is 
 we had a brag board up for the hunters who had trophy <unk> so i pinned a couple of the better pictures to the board 
 this kid <unk> with pride then ran off to use the bathroom 
 this is when dad chimed in and thanked me for a much more personal reason 
 he and the kid 's mom had gone through a fairly nasty divorce and she had majority custody 
 scouting events were one of the few ways that dad could spend extended quality time with his son and this camping trip had been very good for the both of them 
 he got a little choked up about it as did i. i simply told him this is what scouting is all about 
 <unk> other people at all times 
 this is just the tip of the <unk> '' 
 over the next year+ they became regulars of the store 
 i knew which troop they were with a large and active one so they were pretty consistently in need of various <unk> camping supplies 
 more pictures got posted to the brag board 
 his first summer camp saw him earn four merit badges and the mile swim badge 
 i started to volunteer with his troop as a merit badge counselor and had a great time 
 however real life gets in the way 
 school and a couple of new jobs meant i could n't <unk> the time i needed to to help his troop out 
 we basically <unk> apart and the other things going on in my life made me forget about him and his dad 
 until late in <unk> i get a phone call out of the blue 
 the voice on the other end is deeper self confident 
 is <unk> there '' 
 yeah that 's me who is this '' 
 it 's that young scout from the store calling me up to <unk> me to his eagle court of honor 
 i stood there in my kitchen in mute shock 
 all those memories of helping him out came flooding back 
 you better believe i 'll be there 
 i 'll even try to fit into my old uniform '' 
 and so i did 
 though i <unk> the shorts and went for pants 
 this young boy now turned into a young man stood tall and proud as they pinned the eagle <unk> to his shirt <unk> the eagle charge and gave a short speech thanking people who 'd made a difference in his life 
 he looked right at me as he gave the speech pointed me out and said this guy right here he was the first adult to encourage me 
 his example as an eagle was what i followed 
 i can not thank him enough '' 
 tears <unk> 
 following the ceremony i found his dad 
 scouting had made both of them better people 
 he 'd decided that being bitter towards his kid 's mom was n't what a scout leader oh yeah he was now an assistant scoutmaster the bug <unk> very hard should be doing 
 this had allowed their divorce to become more <unk> and they had successfully <unk> custody some time earlier 
 he was a happier man and was so proud of his son i was pretty sure his chest was going to burst 
 his son now tall strong confident and an obvious leader was <unk> to go places 
 he would be graduating high school the next spring and was looking at getting into college for a degree in <unk> with a minor in criminal justice 
 he wanted to live his oath and law by being a police officer 
 my own chest felt like it was going to burst at this point 
 i still keep in touch with him 
 he 's now coming up on his <unk> birthday and is <unk> applications for various police departments around town 
 i 've already told him that i 'd gladly be his reference because he 's one of the guys we all want to become a cop someone with a strong and steadfast sense of duty honor integrity generosity and kindness of spirit 
 he 'll make a damn fine officer and i can say that a little part of that just a little part is because of my <unk> to help him choose tents one day several years ago 
 tl dr - just read it it 'll do your soul some good 
 this happened yesterday while the story linked happened a few months ago 
 my husband and i are done shopping at the local grocery store 
 we are next in line at the self-checkouts 
 there are only two self-checkouts open at the time and both have customers who have just started their transactions 
 we have maybe 15 items or so 
 we hear a voice from behind us 
 & gt woman : do you mind if i go in front of you 
 i only have 2 things 
 we are n't in a hurry so i turn fully prepared to say sure 
 go ahead '' 
 when i recognize the woman 
 it 's the customer from this story so instead i smile and ask : & gt me : have you ever worked in a customer service position 
 & gt her : yes 
 & gt me : did you ever have a customer who acted so <unk> that it stuck in your memory 
 & gt her : yes ... & gt me : you were the woman at my store who dropped something and instead of picking it up yourself or asking for assistance went - * snap snap point * - at me 
 so how bout you wait your turn 
 she started to say something back but at this point my husband started laughing pretty hard he said afterwards it was mostly in shock since i do n't usually stand up for myself much and she just pursed her lips and stood there 
 it was an awkward couple of minutes waiting after that.i work at an ice cream shop and when children come in with their parents i sometimes like to <unk> ask the kids if they wanted to pay instead of the parents 
 it gets the kids talking if they 're not too shy 
 and it makes the parents chuckle 
 today i asked a little girl in a dress if she was going to pay and she said i ca n't because i do n't have any money or a credit card '' 
 mom laughed and then part way through the transaction she decided to buy a $ 10 gift card 
 she gave it to her daughter to use as a credit card and told her to keep it safe 
 : next time she comes in she can definitely pay 
 i thought that was the sweetest thing and the mom is a regular customer 
 it made me very happy today during a frustrating shift 
 a lovely little tale of how i went shopping and managed to get fired 
 let 's give you some context to help you out though 
 my brother and i are half chinese 3 years apart and i 'm 5 '' 11 and he 's just under 6 '' 2. we have different <unk> - so it 's always weird to hear wow you guys look the same '' 
 when we really do n't 
 he has a fair few more pounds on me too 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- so i 've a day off and i 'm going to meet my friends 
 i 've got 20 minutes to kill and i 'm <unk> over whether or not i 'm going to grab a new graphics card for my computer 
 my brother gets discounts which i 've never used but i figured if there was something worthwhile i will get it on his discount 
 so i go into the shop and i 'm staring at graphics cards <unk> one to another 
 i 'm stood there for a good 5 minutes before someone then comes up to me and just stares at me 
 what 's up '' 
 i end up asking <unk> as it 's obvious they want my attention 
 i notice she 's got a <unk> and like me she 's wearing a plain black t-shirt 
 however she does n't have a problem with my t-shirt 
 why are you wearing jeans '' 
 obviously i 'm bewildered but she just goes on 
 you know what the policy is here '' so i ca n't help but laugh 
 i figure she 's having a laugh with me and that it 's an interesting way to try and close a sale 
 electronics shop with a dress code 
 hilarious 
 this however is n't the desired response as the mood flips completely 
 she 's shaking 
 shaking with rage at the fact i 'm just giggling in her face like a girl 
 get into the office 
 right now '' 
 she tries to lead me by the arm like i 'm a <unk> <unk> and she was even more <unk> by the fact i <unk> my hand from her 
 disregarding my confused expression and comment of what the fuck '' 
 she runs off 
 in under a minute she 's brought back a heavy set bloke who looks pretty unhappy with the fact he 's been brought out 
 unlike everyone else who i notice is wearing a black t-shirt and black trousers he 's in casual clothes 
 he 's the boss 
 he 's now getting increasingly unhappy as she fills in the encounter with stories of my <unk> and of the recent <unk> '' 
 so i cut in i argue about how this is an understanding and i get told to <unk> it '' 
 that expression was genuinely used 
 i was then berated while i try to cut in to explain the situation 
 i 'm also now running out of time so i then try to call my brother so he can get his ass here and sort it all out 
 however he then has the nerve to take my phone off me and then really lay into me about having my phone on the sales floor 
 he tries to then take me to the back office - as we 've got a crowd growing but i shrug them off 
 i 'm swearing he 's swearing and then it comes 
 i 'm fired 
 you 're not him 
 bullshit 
 he then grabs me and starts dragging me to the door and i 'm flailing around trying to stay on my feet kicking boxes and shelves and finally we 're at the door 
 to which i 'm pushed out of 
 he 's then stood blocking the doorway <unk> with how i acted stating how appalled he is 
 my phone starts ringing and i see it 's my brother - he had a dropped call from me 
 i answer and immediately tell him to run back to work 
 he 's on his lunch break 2 minutes away and i then decide to take it further 
 i tell his boss to get fucked 
 i swear 
 i make a scene 
 we 're on the street and people are stopping to watch the theater unfold before them 
 he 's calling the police there 's vile things said and gestured and then my brother turns up 
 his look is golden but what i 'm enjoying much more is the look of his boss 
 the look of his supervisor 
 god how i loved the look on her face as while the manager was going on in heaves she had such a smug look 
 so i pulled the race card as well as a half chinese guy can anyway and apologies were so <unk> and suddenly they were n't barring the door 
 they were trying to bring us both in 
 if this was the <unk> we might have been able to make a bigger deal of this 
 but a typical english town 
 not so much 
 but i went to listen to the apologies just to <unk> them off 
 on the upside i got a free gtx <unk> would n't give me anything better but hey 
 wish i was able to put this more eloquently but <unk> at a children 's clothing store usually means dealing with a load of screaming kids annoyed parents and a hell of a lot of clothes to constantly clean up 
 it 's exhausting especially as a job to just get me through college but it has it 's perks 
 cut to today 
 an older woman and a little boy came into my store today 
 she approached me and asked me to help her pick out jeans for her grandson 
 she seemed to need a lot of help with understanding the sizes of the jeans and how they 're supposed to fit 
 she then explained to me that the little boy 's parents had passed away a few weeks ago and she became his legal guardian along with his two older sisters 
 i now understood why she was having so much trouble with picking out clothing 
 my heart broke for this woman and her grandchildren but she was doing the best she could and that was very inspiring 
 long story short i gave the woman every coupon we could possibly give she got almost ten pairs of jeans <unk> 
 as the pair were leaving i heard a small voice behind me : excuse me ma'am '' 
 the little boy was staring up at me 
 i smiled and asked him what he needed help with 
 i just wanted to thank you for helping me today 
 my grandma is usually really stressed when we go shopping 
 thank you for helping her 
 thank you so much '' 
 that makes this job worth it 
 edit : thanks for the gold friendly anonymous user 
 first time lurker long time poster 
 on desktop so be <unk> about the formatting : p so i 'm a full time assistant manager wage slave at one particular branch of the company i work at but very very occasionally i have to do a shift at another store 
 usually in the morning because i 'm training people but today i got the late afternoon shift over there just to make things easier 
 my normal branch is entirely <unk> but this branch i 'm covering in is mostly <unk> with a strip of lino maybe <unk> wide and the length of the wall maybe 10m along the back wall 
 every couple of days that area gets mopped usually just after the store closes to prevent accidents 
 now today i was doing training and kinda helping to cover as well 
 myself and the coworker i 'm on with are both scheduled to finish at closing time so things need to be done before we close including mopping that section 
 now this branch has a customer that is constantly trying to cause trouble for the staff do n't they all really 
 : p 
 i have n't yet met this woman but the ladies at this branch have warned me ahead of time what she 's like 
 i promise all this backstory is relevant : ok so it 's getting close to the end of the day there are a couple of people around that i 'm helping when my coworker gets my attention and discreetly points out to me the woman they warned me about 
 she 's looking around eyes <unk> just generally looking a bit shifty 
 i tell my coworker to stay at the counters and i 'm going to go down the back and mop so i can keep an eye on her 
 she 's wandering aimlessly around the store i pull out mop and bucket and wet floor sign and get to it all while watching her like a <unk> 
 she does n't do anything out of the ordinary until she notices me mopping 
 she makes a beeline for the table next to the lino that 's a little further down from where i am 
 i notice she keeps looking at me out of the corner of her eye keeps fiddling with the table keeps looking at me 
 i have a feeling i know what 's going to happen so i take a step back and turn to the side so i 'm not facing her 
 what i am facing is a mirror that has a perfect view of this woman without her knowing i can see her 
 i watch as she lays down on the lino then starts yelling my arm 
 oh my god my arm 
 it 's broken '' 
 i whip around and come running over to her feigning shock and concern and asking what happened 
 & gt c : i fell and broke my arm 
 oh my god how could you let this happen 
 i 'll sue you 
 what 's your name 
 i 'm going to sue you and this company right out of business '' 
 i pull out my phone and tell her i 'm calling an ambulance 
 what i actually do is call my area manager am a woman i have a brilliant working relationship with we 're on the same <unk> : & gt me : hello 
 yes i need an ambulance '' 
 & gt am : what 's wrong 
 has something happened '' 
 & gt me : i have a lady here who has fallen over '' 
 & gt c in the background : damn right i 've fallen over 
 this is all your fault '' 
 & gt am : is it that woman '' 
 & gt me : yes she thinks her arm might be broken '' 
 & gt am : do you need me to play along '' 
 & gt me : yes please '' 
 & gt am : how does she think she fell '' 
 & gt me : not sure let me check '' 
 i speak to the customer the dispatcher would like to know if you 're feeling dizzy at all 
 <unk> 
 have you taken anything perhaps had something to drink '' 
 & gt c : fuck you 
 i fell on your fucking wet floor because you were mopping and i slipped '' 
 & gt me : i have n't mopped this section yet the floor here is completely dry '' 
 and would n't you know it 
 her arm completely healed in a matter of seconds 
 she did n't say another word and began to stand up to leave 
 i stood up with her and put on my <unk> voice 
 & gt me : i would like to make something very clear 
 you are no longer welcome in this store or in fact any of our stores 
 i saw you lie down on the floor 
 how dare you try and pull a stunt like that 
 if i see you here again i will call the police 
 get out and do n't come back '' 
 she bolted 
 & gt am still on the phone : damn you 're scary when you 're angry '' 
 **tl : dr woman tries to claim she slipped on the wet floor that was n't wet i shut her down and kicked her out 
 <unk> 
 **so i work in fairly expensive ice cream shop and i 've only recently had this job 
 we 're open from 11 am to 11 pm and one day two weeks ago i had a shift that started right at 11. so i show up in my uniform ten minutes until and outside the door is a mom and her three young daughters patiently waiting for our store to open so they can get a treat 
 i do n't have access to a key and the doors are locked 
 i <unk> inside and my manager is focused on the register 
 i knock on the door to get his attention so he can let me in so i can get prepared for my shift and when i do that one of the little girls looks up at me with a frown and says & gt you need to wait 
 it caught me completely off guard and i manage to say but i work here and do n't have the key to get in '' 
 mom bursts out laughing 
 it was all good my manager lets me in and a few minutes later we open and the family gets their ice cream 
 i just thought it was funny and kind of sweet that the girl told me off for potentially being a rude and impatient customer.two stories in two days 
 yep 
 i worked at national sandwich chain for two years and in that time i saw some crazy crap going down 
 not everything was bad however 
 as weird and bizarre as my town is there are some good people that live here 
 one afternoon as i was starting my shift at national sandwich store a dad and his son came in to get a sandwich 
 this kid was maybe 5 years old and as cute as could be 
 he had been saving up his money to get one of our kid 's meals and he was so excited to get to pick out everything he wanted on his sandwich 
 he added a cookie and a chocolate milk to complete the order and everything got put into one of the new awesome lion king bags we had 
 i totally got one for myself 
 when we got to the register he pulled out his spider man wallet and pulled out the money he needed 
 it was all bunched up and wadded but he carefully placed it on the counter and then looked at me 
 i have adults that hand me wads of cash so it 's nothing new to reach across the counter and smooth it all out before i end the transaction 
 however as i started to reach for it his dad stopped me 
 & gt dad : no son 
 this wo n't do '' 
 & gt son : what did i do dad '' 
 & gt dad : well it 's rude to just throw your money in a ball at the cashier 
 you need to be polite and take the time to <unk> out each bill and then hand it to her so she can get you the right amount of change '' 
 the dad took the bills <unk> them out and handed them back to the little boy to try again 
 & gt dad : this is the right way to give the cashier your money 
 they 'll always appreciate you for it '' 
 little boy was so excited when i took the money from him and gave him back his change and his lunch bag 
 he shouted thank you and took his dad 's hand to be on his way 
 thank you to that dad for teaching his son that retail workers are people <unk> i currently work at a gas station our usual customers being from the neighborhood down the street 
 i also live in the same community so most of our customers are neighbors recognize me from around the area have mutual friends etc 
 quite an ideal retail job for me 
 as a result i am happier way more personable and i love love love 97 % of the people i see everyday 
 first name basis the whole 9 yards 
 <unk> two days ago i get this.. <unk> who is just a nightmare 
 i should have seen the signs since the only rude people i get are not from around here or unfortunately stereotypically rich old entitled white women 
 this lady spewed vileness from her veins i swear 
 i felt the disturbance in the force 
 and i had good reason 
 she decided to purchase two <unk> cases of soda from two separate <unk> popular companies 
 if you purchase two from the same company you receive a discount of what totals to a few dollars 
 it 's stated as such on the signage for both displays 
 she grabs these two cases as well as a bottle of cheap wine and is <unk> to the whole transaction 
 after she pays she notices that the computer did n't take the money off for the discounted price 
 oh great you did n't discount me the sign states blah blah <unk> '' oh it had to be two cases from the same company if you want to change i can- '' are we done here '' 
 sorry <unk> '' are we done here 
 are we done here 
 are we done here '' 
 uh 
 sure '' 
 she starts to turn but quite a line has <unk> by this point 
 most are regulars 
 next in line is <unk> <unk> regular customer who is kinda tall lots of tattoos fairly intimidating to some i 'm sure but always friendly to me 
 i just wanted this bitch gone but what was next made my day 
 i do n't remember exactly how he put it but it made my day 
 you should n't be so rude to people when they 're explaining why you 're wrong '' 
 it 's none of your business- '' well if you read the signs rather than being rude it 'd be your business '' 
 it 's none of your- '' are we done here 
 are we done here 
 are we done here '' 
 i love my <unk> so for some background i work in a deli at a grocery store 
 on saturday i was closing in the hot deli 
 we close at 7 p.m. and around 7:05 i see a man come up to the counter 
 he looked in the case and saw that nothing was there 
 he looked at me and then looked at the sign that had our hours posted 
 i thought for a second that he would ask if i could still get him something 
 or ask if we were still open 
 nope 
 not a word was said 
 he just walked away 
 yeah he might have been down because we were n't open 
 but i would 've happily gave him something if he asked 
 but he did n't 
 and that my friends is the short tale of the one customer that knew closed meant <unk> 'm in the <unk> aisle knelt on the floor and filling the bottom shelves totally in the zone 
 because it was a larger than expected <unk> i had to get it all stocked as fast as possible so i could move to another aisle 
 i absently hear a small hi '' as i 'm stocking but i think nothing of it continuing to stock 
 then the hi '' s get louder 
 i look up and come face to face with a toddler probably not even 3 years old yet 
 biggest smile on his face gorgeous blue eyes and i see his dad at the end of the aisle looking our way 
 i 'm the only one in the aisle at this time of day and the dad did n't need anything in this aisle 
 the kid had spotted me and made an instant beeline straight to me all to say hi to me 
 so i said hi back and smiled back at him 
 it was awesome to have a cute little kid come all the way down an aisle just to say hello and he was so sweet but then he threw himself on me and hugged me 
 i was shocked 
 i can only rarely get a hug from my near 4 year old <unk> and he <unk> because i ask him for one 
 but here i am at work tired and sore and this boy is hugging me with all he has 
 i sort of aww 'd and gave him a return hug then he smiled said bye and went back to his dad 
 little dude you made my whole month with that gesture 
 & lt 3 thank you 
 **edit : wow this really blew up whilst i was asleep 
 i 'm very glad you all enjoyed this so much 
 i know how much i enjoy the rare positive story here honestly they make my day sometimes after a bad shift so i thought i 'd share mine 
 <unk> an hour after the store opens a family are the first customers in the store 
 the family is <unk> parents are <unk> while the kids looks local filipino 
 mom and very young daughter go over to the little plushie section of the store while dad and pre-teen son looks at ps4 games 
 so son looks at the new watch_dogs game and comes over to the dad 
 uhm sir can i uhm buy this '' 
 dad looks over and said : you can call me dad daniel '' 
 but sir -- '' the young daughter comes over hugging a pokemon plushie 
 daddy daddy can i have this please '' 
 of course sweetie 
 why do n't you go over to your mommy so she help you pay for it '' 
 okay daddy '' 
 mom and daughter pay for the things while the dad looks back at his son 
 look daniel 
 i know it 's a big change for you but it 's alright 
 you can call me whatever you like until you 're ready okay '' 
 yes sir '' 
 now what did you want to buy '' 
 dad and son pick up a couple of games and after they bought something the kid looks kinda depressed 
 what 's the matter son 
 did you want something else '' 
 i 'm sorry sir '' 
 why '' 
 the games are too expensive i 'm sorry '' 
 <unk> it 's your birthday right 
 you deserve it 
 you 've been a good kid taking care of your sister '' 
 kids looks over to mom and sister then to dad with the biggest smile 
 thank you sir uhm dad '' 
 the dad had a shit eating grin all the way to the parking lot 
 a couple years ago i was a manager for a fashionable plus size clothing store 
 i absolutely loved it 
 the bad customers were bad as expected and sometimes awful also as expected but at least they gave me something to laugh about with my co workers 
 however the good customers ... they were why i worked there 
 & amp nbsp one day a woman in her mid-40s came in with her husband and three boys 
 she was wearing a <unk> and baggy jeans 
 she was sweet but very reserved about trying on clothes 
 she told me that hadn’t purchased women’s clothing for several years and was hoping i could help her with jeans one could say that she was <unk> all about that bass 
 regardless of her weight she was an extremely beautiful and darling woman 
 her family was super <unk> of helping here regain some of her self esteem 
 i was pumped to help her out 
 a process this big was going to take a while so i urged her family to wait on the supplied <unk> while she and i got to work 
 so we shopped grabbing some cute tops and fun bras 
 we talked about how to build <unk> and <unk> pieces and then we got to the danger zone : jeans 
 & amp nbsp i guessed that she was about a size 18-20 and after discussing different cuts of denim we settled on higher <unk> high stretch skinny jeans : they would accommodate her proportionately small waist and large posterior 
 & amp nbsp we got into the fitting room and i <unk> <unk> her to try on one of the <unk> i had picked out for her 
 a few moments later she called me over to come into the fitting room 
 i slipped inside to see her 
 “i haven’t felt this beautiful for a long time ” she said to me 
 there were tears in her eyes and a huge grin on her face 
 & amp nbsp i motioned for her husband and kids to come see 
 as soon as the husband saw her he choked up 
 i couldn’t get over the grin on his face 
 there was so much love in his eyes 
 “you look absolutely gorgeous <unk> & amp nbsp they ended up getting her almost an entirely new wardrobe 
 i’ve never seen a happier family.a little backstory first : back in <unk> i was having a lot of family issues at home so i went to visit my mother 's two sisters in <unk> for a change of <unk> 
 there 's a resort there owned at the time by a <unk> who also owns a line of gas stations that use a dinosaur for their logo 
 it 's a very high end resort drawing some of the nation 's most rich and famous 
 bruce willis arnold <unk> <unk> <unk> and many other people of that <unk> visited and/or owned vacation homes there 
 i liked it so much i decided to make the move long term and found an apartment and a job as a <unk> in a coffee shop not s-bucks 
 that 's where the story starts ... it was about 8pm and i remember it being either november or december mostly because of all the snow 
 the shop closed at 9 and i was doing some cleaning ahead of time so i could get out of work at a decent hour 
 a man walked in the ball cap on his head pulled down to cover his eyes and his head down against the <unk> wind blowing in from the <unk> 
 i greeted him and when he looked up i recognized him 
 i was told to act normal when a celebrity walks in as they justifiably do n't like being <unk> by fans out here 
 i took his order which i remember as 2 small lattes 
 he was alone so i assumed he was in town with his wife and she was either at their vacation home or shopping at one of the many expensive shops there 
 the total came to $ <unk> it 's funny : i ca n't remember what i had for breakfast but i remember the total of bruce willis coffee order from 6 years ago 
 <unk> up the son of an <unk> with a strong <unk> borderline obsessive sometimes to gain my father 's approval i learned to do change in my head at lightning speed 
 * less than 2 seconds after seeing the $ 50 he was about to hand me i told him his change would be $ <unk> 
 he paused a little smirk on his face 
 **bw : ** did you do that in your head 
 **me : ** yes sir 
 bruce then puts the $ 50 back in his wallet and pulls out a $ 20 bill two $ 1 bills and three quarters <unk> $ 22.75 and asks me what the change is 
 i tell him $ <unk> 
 he proceeds to repeat this a few more times with different <unk> of cash he has on him 
 i do n't know if some combination of fatigue and <unk> <unk> put him in a condition where he found my petty math amusing but he was having fun 
 i finally had to end it since i still had stuff that needed to be done cleaning the soft serve machine takes no less than 45 minutes 
 **me : ** i have to get back to work so i 'll do one more 
 if i get it right you have to tip me 
 that last part was a joke obviously 
 he agrees and pulls out $ 72.45 
 before he can move his eyes from the money to mine i say it 's $ <unk> 
 **bw : ** that 's pretty cool **me : ** ... when you 're 19 and bruce willis tells you something that you take for granted is cool it tends to leave you speechless 
 i made his coffee gave it to him and wished him a good night 
 before he left he dropped $ 20 in the tip jar and told me i earned it 
 he was such a cool guy lots of respect for <unk> i just had a story from the zoo less than 24 hours ago 
 i should not have one from the valet already 
 and yet here i am because this is not the first time i 've had this conversation 
 a woman notices our sign that states we are hiring drivers 
 as she pays for her valet she is chatting with me about it mentioning how sorry she feels for the drivers that stand outside in the cold 
 she says my job as the cashier seems so much nicer and i agree because well it is 
 she asks what my shift is and i tell her <unk> monday-friday 
 i let her know we have 24/7 location that needs cashiers for all shifts and my location needs a <unk> cashier monday-friday 
 she asks for an application which i gladly give her 
 this is where it goes <unk> 
 once the application is in her hand she suddenly looks very smug 
 can i mail this back instead of bringing it here '' 
 she asks 
 unusual but ok i write down the address and hand it to her 
 she snatches it out of my hand scratching me with her nails 
 she offers no apology but instead i get a suddenly nasty tone 
 so 
 how do i get your job '' 
 i blink at her and explain what my shift is and then explain the available shifts again 
 i get about halfway through before she interrupts me 
 yeah yeah i heard you but i want your job 
 i want that shift 
 how do i get it '' 
 well ma'am i do n't plan on quitting any time soon i really need this job so getting my exact shift would n't <unk> '' you could just go work outside with the rest of them 
 you 're young 
 they would make you go out there 
 how do i get your job '' 
 i sigh and point to the boxes on the application where she can mark her preferred shift and position 
 have fun out there in the cold '' 
 she <unk> as she walks off 
 i smile at my good fortune as the only mailing address we have is for corporate so that is what i gave her 
 corporate passes applications along to managers solely on the east side of the city and my location is the only one on the west side and we do our own hiring 
 which i would have explained to her if she had n't turned into the wicked witch 
 ah <unk> work at a fast food place we close at 1:00 am on friday and saturday and then we close at 12:00 am every other day 
 one night i was doing my usual thing cleaning all of the machines and whatnot general closing business 
 someone drives up to the window and lays on their horn 
 i 'm like oh for fuck 's sake '' and walk over unlock it and say hi we 're closed for this evening sorry '' 
 lady completely ignores me and goes gim me a double cheeseburger and fries with a coke '' & gt me : sorry ma'am but we 're closed for this evening 
 & gt customer : so 
 i 'm here i have money give me the food i 'm ordering 
 & gt me : ... ma'am we 're closed 
 & gt customer : so 
 & gt me : for the love of god so i ca n't serve you any food not even if i wanted to 
 our grills and fryers have been shut down and cleaned 
 & gt customer : well you have a legal obligation to serve anyone who comes here 
 & gt me : what 
 she said this with the smuggest fucking look on her face 
 & gt customer : you legally can not turn away any customer under california law 
 & gt me : sorry i 'll be right back 
 i walked over and took our we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone '' sign off the wall and walked back over to the window 
 & gt me : <unk> see this 
 gon na have to exercise this right <unk> ... now 
 have a good night 
 <unk> window and locks it- i was tired and cranky and wanted to go home and i 'm still amazed that i did n't get fired for that 
 so i have been working in a fast food chain for about six months now it 's a pretty low business store and my co workers are all pretty funny and chill to be around i 'm in the back making food on the night shift it 's really dead and there is only two employees me making the food and another taking the very few and far in between orders an older man in his mid <unk> or so comes in and orders a burger and fries pretty standard and since business was slow i make it fresh off the grill he eats the burger and comes back up to the counter pretty awkwardly 
 i was worried he was going to complain because our manager had left to grab some coffee from the nearby gas station can i see the person who made this burger 
 he demanded and my co worker <unk> pointed me out so i approach the counter from the back and he reaches out and shakes my hand son that 's the best sandwich i 've had in years i do n't know what you did to it but it 's amazing i stood there with a stupid grin and said thank you then he slipped me a 10 dollar bill tipped his hat and left it 's the small things like this which make me kinda like my jobthis is n't my personal experience but rather the story of my classmate 
 he works at a fast food restaurant and recently he was in an altercation at work 
 he rang up a customer 's order and added nacho cheese onto his meal which is a little extra 
 he informed the customer just to double check and he had in fact <unk> him then promptly removed the cheese from the order 
 well the customer for whatever reason did n't believe him 
 my classmate insisted that he did take the cheese off the order and he was n't being charged for it 
 the customer called him a liar then reached across the counter and punched him in the mouth splitting his lip and <unk> in a trip to the hospital which required stitches 
 now the customer is being taken to court on an assault charge which could get my classmate upwards of $ 5,000 dollars 
 all over nacho cheese 
 edit : clarificationsso here 's this bloke 
 about <unk> it 's early in the morning and he 's getting food from our breakfast bar so he can eat breakfast with his 25ish son 
 they 're behind a lady in line who has actual groceries 
 so when they walk up the lady is about halfway through paying 
 but the instant the dad reaches my line he tries to hand me his cash for his order 
 i tell him sir if you 'll give me just one second i can finish up with this woman and i 'll be right with you '' 
 he glares at me but retracts his money 
 a minute later the lady leaves and i turn back to the man who shoves his twenty at me and then stares at me blankly when i take it 
 i weigh his food ring him up and it comes out to like <unk> or something 
 i tell him that that 's his total and he just stares at me and takes his food 
 i shrug and put it into the register 
 now once you enter the amount into the computer you 're not supposed to change it even if you know for sure the amount in the register will be the same it 's just company policy 
 so as i 'm putting the twenty in he goes wait i was going to give you the 32 cents '' 
 <unk> the fuck did n't you then * i think but whatever 
 sorry 
 i should have asked 
 unfortunately i ca n't change it now that i 've put it into the computer '' 
 he tries to convince me to for a minute then he gets mad and says your way or the highway right 
 bitch '' 
 he yanks his change from my hand and walks off with his very <unk> son 
 here 's where the story gets impossible 
 i 'm going on with my day forgotten all about the guy ringing up other people when i hear a little throat clear from the end of my register 
 i look over and it 's the guy 
 and you wo n't believe what he said 
 he said i am *so* sorry about earlier '' 
 he really did 
 he apologized 
 he explained that he has low blood sugar that makes him very cranky but that that was no excuse and he felt so bad for being so rude and short with me 
 i told him it was absolutely fine and he wished me a beautiful day and left 
 he apologized 
 a real customer actually gave me an unprompted apology for their rudeness 
 i spent the rest of the day just <unk> with <unk> bit of preface : i 'm a manager at a fast food burger joint in a small town 
 i 'm also gayer than <unk> john doing a cover of <unk> over the rainbow while dressed in drag 
 <unk> so sometime after our supper rush had died down i went into the cooler to count my inventory 
 when that was all said and done i came back out onto the floor to help out my co-workers prepare for their <unk> stuff 
 however as i wear glasses they immediately fog up due to the change in temperature 
 my co-workers started to laugh at me so to make it even better i put on my best southern accent and yelled - **oh <unk> help me 
 i dear say i 've <unk> blahnd 
 ** '' cue co-workers laughing their butts off because i legitimately sounded like a southern <unk> or something 
 meanwhile a customer on front counter who could n't see me at the time needed to get his order taken so i went up front to help him out 
 he refuses to let a man help him instead stating that he wanted the cute sounding southern gal '' to help him out 
 not wanting to let him down i put the voice back on and say **oh my gawd a <unk> at this hour 
 god bless momma 
 ** '' the man flushes orders something quietly and leaves 
 **edit : i 've gotten some creepy and demanding pms about delivering 
 i do n't like the idea of just sharing my voice online 
 sorry 
 ** white 
 i 've been staring at the white walls of the video game store for about 2 hours since lunch 
 it was a very slow day i glanced at the tables in front of the store and my heart ache 
 it was the donation table for the victims of typhoon yolanda that wretched my country and even though i have donated what i can i still feel sad whenever i saw the people on the tv suffering 
 i was broken out of my thoughts when the doors <unk> open 
 customers finally 
 she was a small girl about 10 or 11 and a pink hello kitty backpack was at her small back 
 her mother was <unk> her a few plastic bags in tow 
 i recognized her mom 
 when i was selling cigarettes on the street i see her <unk> clothes she made herself on her stall at the market 
 she now has her own online shop and making a name for herself 
 the daughter just had a birthday and her mom finally has enough money to buy a ps3 and some games 
 the girl <unk> half-skipped to my counter 
 she opened her backpack and pulled out a console 
 her mom handed me the bag full of games 
 can i return this '' 
 sure sweetie no problem '' 
 i inspected at the console and the games and nothing was opened 
 per policy i returned the money to the mom 
 she handed the money to the girl and she ran off as fast as her little feet can take her 
 i was about to ask when the mom seeing my expression explained 
 she wants to sell her birthday gift so she can donate to the victims '' 
 i honestly teared a bit there 
 she was willing to give up what was supposed to be hers and gave to those in need 
 that 's real generosity out there 
 while i was watching her talking to the girl at the donations table i was reminded that even though there are a lot of selfish assholes in the world there 's a person just like that little girl and i was happy 
 edit : yolanda and hayain are the same typhoon 
 update : i was texted by my co-worker today and somebody is claiming that they are the mother of this story and now <unk> in the rewards for their good deed '' 
 more on these here & gt birthday girl part 2 so i work in a <unk> shop 
 once a year we have a rather popular contest where coffee cups have tabs that might get you a car five grand visa gift cards or gift cards to our shops 
 most of the time though you will win a free coffee or donut which suits our customer base fine 
 now one day a teenage couple comes in 
 somehow not sure why but i knew they were going to pull something 
 they do n't come up to order together the girl comes up first 
 she hands me a winning tab and orders the most expensive drink on the menu 
 honestly i do n't care the drink is easy to make and i would do the same thing 
 besides the drink is <unk> by contest rules 
 while waiting for the machine to fill the cup i glance at the tab 
 it 's torn in half only showing the english part of the bilingual tab 
 not that big a deal the tabs are annoying to rip off the cup 
 but coffee sense is still tingling so i do n't put it in the container and just set it aside 
 i hand her her cup wish her a nice day and she almost leaves loitering around the door as her boyfriend comes up to the counter 
 what a surprise 
 he also wants the same size and type of drink 
 he also has half a winning tab 
 but <unk> <unk> 
 it 's all in french 
 this is a moment i have only dreamt of 
 i smile grab the previous tab and place both together in front of him slowly as if i 'm a <unk> <unk> 
 i do n't say anything to him just smiling and he bolts out dragging his girlfriend with him 
 which is a shame i was about to offer him a smaller non contest cup and lid so they could both share 
 edit : man lots of canadians on this subreddit 
 : d tried to make the coffee shop as <unk> as possible but i ca n't fool my fellow <unk> sunday i was working pos at our store and a sweet older lady came up to me but before i could begin she started the conversation as such : & gt lady : hands me two jewelry tags with no jewelry attached the nice blond young man that was working yesterday rang up a lot of jewelry for me and i got all the way home with them but neither of them were on my receipt 
 & gt me : may i take a look at your receipt 
 she handed it to me and i saw the employee # of the person i thought rang her up - and he is a really nice <unk> young man and lo and behold those two pieces definitely were n't on the receipt 
 & gt me : it was very honest of you to come forward and tell us about this 
 most people would have not done that 
 & gt lady : my conscience would not have allowed it 
 i tried to give her a 20 % off for her items she was purchasing that day but she would n't have it 
 she used her little 15 % coupon and was quite happy 
 also i did n't tell upper management what happened so as to not get said employee in trouble 
 i did mention it to him to be more careful 
 still ca n't believe these customers actually exist 
 i mean i 've heard they exist i 'd just never seen one in <unk> : holy cow i 'm internet famous 
 alright this is my first post so i 'll do my best 
 <unk> : i work at a nationwide grocery chain in southern california 
 i work every department and have a <unk> of stories but this is the first one off the top of my head 
 i am a college student close to graduating too 
 one day as i was working in the deli one morning a gentleman approaches me 
 he 'll be known as jerk 
 jerk : hey man i know you are probably a high school dropout so i 'll make this really easy for you 
 i was frozen 
 i had never been insulted like that by a customer 
 i was visibly turning red from the insult 
 he continues 
 jerk : i want <unk> of a pound of roast beef 
 do you know what that is in decimals '' 
 he says in a condescending tone 
 me : it 's <unk> of a pound sir 
 and you can find somebody else to serve you '' 
 i then motion to my co-worker to help him but she refuses having heard the conversation 
 jerk goes to my store director gets told to leave and not come back for being disrespectful to employees 
 my store director and associates are pretty awesome people 
 t dr : jerk insults me and calls me a dropout 
 gets <unk> by entire store and told to leave 
 this happened a few months ago but just got reminded of it recently 
 so backstory 
 i work in the wireless department in a big department store 
 the wireless section is <unk> and technically i do n't work for said department store and i 'm really only able to do transactions related to cell phones 
 that said if i 'm not busy with a wireless customer i 'll go and help customers who are looking for stuff 
 i 've worked here long enough that i know where a lot of stuff is and sometimes electronics is understaffed 
 so one time i have someone come by looking for batteries 
 those little button kinds usually a cr2032 
 well a lot of customers have trouble finding the right size so i lead her to the batteries area and help her pick out the battery 
 i then gave a short i 'm actually part of the wireless center here if you ever need help with a cell phone ... '' etc 
 etc 
 oh actually since you 're here i did have an issue with my cell phone '' 
 she mentioned that she recently got a new cell phone and she was n't happy with it 
 i asked if she got it from our store or any of the locations we had and she did n't 
 she got the phone directly from the carrier 
 she did n't have the phone with her but she said she got the latest model for a particular line of phones 
 btw i 'm in canada 
 so for high end cell phones this one was about $ 750 usually you 'd have to go for a <unk> term of at least $ 80 a month with a $ 200-300 upfront device cost 
 recently they dropped the minimum rate for some carriers to $ 70 but at the time it was still minimum $ 80 per month 
 i asked her what was wrong with it 
 it does n't call fast enough '' 
 that struck me as odd 
 at first i assumed that she meant that little pause between pressing the call button and when it starts ringing when the phone is trying to connect 
 i <unk> for a bit more detail 
 well she goes on to say how she always listens to the radio and how there 's always these contests where a certain caller number will win some sort of money prize or concert tickets or whatever 
 and she 's annoyed that she 's never able to call into the radio stations or when she does she does n't win 
 i 'm ... pretty baffled at this ... i basically reply that there 's got to be tons of people trying to call at the same time and there are a ton of <unk> as to whether or not she would be able to get through 
 she was annoyed because she thought that this model was supposed to be the best phone in the market 
 she then asks how other people are able to call in and win these contests ... again it 's pretty much chance 
 i just replied saying maybe they programmed the phone to have the stations on speed dial or maybe they had an app that helps them dial repeatedly or faster 
 she then asks what an app was ... and i had to explain what apps are and how she can get apps on the phone ... lastly she asked me if i knew what phones people who are winning radio contests are using 
 no 
 i do n't 
 i then went back to my manager and the conversation went something like : & gt so yeah she got a phone model and is n't happy with it '' 
 & gt why '' 
 & gt she says she 's not winning radio contests '' 
 & gt stop there 
 i 'm done 
 i work as a cashier in a high end grocery store 
 the other day an older european lady came through my <unk> 
 i asked her how she was doing if she needed bags etc 
 of course she does n't reply so i start scanning her stuff and place them in bags anyways 
 a package of radishes scan through and show up as $ 1.99 
 the conversation goes as follows : her : stop right there 
 why are they 1.99 
 me : that 's the usual price 
 her : the fucking sign said <unk> me : ok well i 'll call someone 
 the produce manager comes over and tells her that they 're 1.99. her : this is fucking absurd 
 i need to see the sign 
 you have to honour the price on the sign 
 i want them free this is n't fair 
 the manager takes her over to the radishes and it turns out she was looking at the wrong fucking sign and the price was actually 1.99. she then comes back pays for the rest of her stuff throws the radishes at my face and leaves 
 i later found out that she comes in about 3 times a week and argues with the employees to get free stuff 
 she 's apparently made my co worker cry on 2 separate occasions 
 edit : holy shit this exploded 
 loving all of the vegetable <unk> 
 and for the people telling me if i should press charges i 'd prefer not to because she did not really cause any bodily harm just made my retail experiences a <unk> lot more interesting 
 needless to say though i will be speaking to my manager about banning her 
 i used to work in electronics for a large department store so it was common i dealt with large purchases of <unk> game systems cameras etc 
 usually these were all paid for by card 
 i 'd been through the training on how to detect counterfeit bills though since some people still used cash 
 a middle-aged man walks around the department for a bit and after helping him pick out a tv i go to ring him up 
 the purchase came to around $ 700 paid for in $ 100 bills 
 the man smiles and in a very thick <unk> european accent <unk> i printed those myself '' 
 i laugh and go to put the money away but it feels lighter than normal 
 i do the usual tests holding it up to the light scratching the surface and it fails all of them 
 this guy actually tried to use printed money 
 at this point i call over a department lead to help me out because i 've never dealt with counterfeit bills before 
 he smiles at the guest says we 'll hold his tv in the backroom for a minute while we complete the transaction and leads him away from the department 
 after around 15 minutes i was told i was being replaced in electronics and spent the last two hours of my day giving a police report 
 **tl dr** - guy tries to buy an expensive tv proudly announces he 's using money he printed at home gets <unk> : this is a prepaid <unk> carrier store 
 the way these work we 're not a corporate franchise but rather an <unk> authorized dealer much like a car dealership 
 we have a few locations under our dealership but the rest are owned by different dealers 
 this means that inventory and returns are not shared across all locations 
 if you bought your phone at a location that 's owned by another dealer you must return or replace it there 
 we often have problems with customers trying to return merchandise from other dealers locations 
 i always try my best to explain that although we ca n't take them back we 'd be more than happy to call the other location and see if they can 
 <unk> we also offer them a discount or a free <unk> if they choose to buy a phone from us that way we win their business 
 most of the time we resolve the issue 
 sometimes they get upset and leave 
 this guy was something else 
 older man i 'd say late 50 's wearing a cheap suit with a <unk> attitude and a sense of entitlement 
 we had a few customers in the store and my co-workers and i were trying to help everyone as quick as possible 
 & gt me : welcome to store name how can i help you 
 & gt c : my wife 's phone is n't working 
 i need you to fix it 
 & gt me : sure what 's going on with it 
 & gt c : it wo n't make phone calls 
 & gt me : okay 
 let me take a look at it 
 i inspect the phone and realize that it 's a model that we do n't carry at our location so i already know they did n't buy it from us 
 the phone has no signal 
 i try power cycling the phone running network updates and everything i can to fix it 
 no dice 
 & gt me : alright 
 the phone 's not getting signal 
 i 've tried <unk> it and <unk> it and it 's not doing much 
 looks like you got a defective phone 
 where did you -- & gt c : -- well no shit 
 that 's what i just said 
 i just need you to fix it 
 & gt me : of course 
 where did you get it 
 & gt c : i got it from you guys 
 & gt me : are you sure 
 we have n't carried this model in a while 
 & gt c : it says carrier name on it 
 where else would i have gotten it 
 & gt me : i mean which location did you get it from 
 & gt c : i do n't know where she got it 
 are n't you guys carrier name 
 & gt me : yes but we 're all <unk> owned and it sounds like she might 've gotten it from a different location 
 let me scan the barcode to see if it came from our s -- & gt c : look do n't waste my f -- king time 
 i just need you to fix it 
 there were kids in the store so the swearing bothered me 
 & gt me : look i 'm sorry but i ca n't replace it if she got it somewhere else 
 the best i can d -- & gt c : that 's bullshit 
 let me speak to your manager 
 now i had some heavy <unk> work done that morning and they gave me some good shit for the pain so i was feeling a little brave '' 
 the guy was being a total douchebag swearing in front of kids and being all around unreasonable so i thought to myself that if i 'm going to kick him out eventually i might as well f -- k with the guy a little 
 & gt me : no 
 & gt c : <unk> me 
 & gt me : i do n't think he or any of us want to deal with your crap right now 
 i 'm here trying to help you out and you 're just being a prick 
 & gt c : what did you just call me 
 you get your f -- king manager right now or i will have your f -- king job 
 what is your name 
 & gt me : we do n't really have a manager but here 's the owner 's information 
 we have two business cards one of them has the owner 's information for customers like this for when the owner 's not around 
 it says store name john smith general manager with the owner 's cellphone number & gt c : and what is your name 
 as he furiously picks up his phone 
 & gt me : you do n't really need my name 
 just tell him it 's the employee that does n't put up with pricks like me '' 
 & gt c : yeah okay 
 we 'll see how funny you are when you lose your job 
 he calls the owner 
 most of the customers that were in at the time were regulars so they were secretly in on what was about to happen 
 my cellphone rings 
 i pick it up with a smile 
 & gt me : this is john smith at store name how can i help you 
 everyone in the store cracks the f -- k up 
 & gt c : this is f -- king bullshit 
 i do n't know what kinda bullshit game you 're playing here but i 'm taking my business elsewhere 
 & gt me : i 'm counting on it 
 have a nice day 
 **edit : whoever sent me gold i would unofficially hire you for a day and let you kick out all the rude customers you want 
 : <unk> - i work in a sandwich shop 
 there is another person who works at the sandwich shop who has the same name as me 
 i 'm pretty well known for having resting b face 
 i was not in when this event occured but i had multiple co-workers text me after 
 woman walks in and orders her food 
 this is the exchange 
 c ashier : will that be all for you today 
 w <unk> : is insert my name here working today 
 c : which one 
 w : the one with the bitch face 
 c : ... no she 's off today 
 all my co-workers are in absolute shock 
 one even <unk> me immediately after 
 a couple more text me after work or the next day 
 i find out a couple days later that the woman was my mom 
 -_- '' edited for <unk> time lurker first time poster 
 bare with me i 'm posting from my phone 
 i work at the customer service desk at a grocery store 
 while i do have to deal with insane customers and annoying lottery people on a daily basis it does have some perks there 's a computer there and i can do ny homework when work is slow 
 currently i 'm in school for aquatic science and fisheries 
 i want to do aquaculture for my career and i 've had to add more school because of changing my <unk> 
 it 's worth it though 
 yesterday i was working on a paper about environmental policy and one of my regular customers came up to me 
 he wished me good luck on my test and then i explained that i was working on this environmental policy paper 
 we then had a long conversation and he told me that he works for the epa he would love to see me apply for an internship and he 'll put in a good word since he sees me every day 
 for anyone that is n't into environmental science this is how you get your career started 
 we said our goodbyes and i went back to my paper 
 i hear coughing and to my surprise it 's my manager 
 manager : so your dream is to do aquaculture 
 sounds interesting 
 do me one thing you need to follow that dream 
 that guy sounds like your ticket out of here and i wo n't have you working at a grocery store your entire life '' 
 words have never <unk> me to work harder for something 
 while it will be a happy day to leave a store that has caused me so much stress i 'll never forget the people that <unk> and pushed me to be the best 
 today is not that day though 
 i just spent half an hour telling a lady that she ca n't return meat because she let it spoil 
 edit : wow i ca n't believe that i made the front page 
 thanks everyone for your support and hopefully in the future i 'll show you some pictures of my fish 
 : edit 2 : i ca n't believe how big this got and thank you for the gold 
 i 'm still in shock and i feel like a celebrity 
 edit 3 : finally learned his name 
 epa here i come 
 <unk> <unk> so i 'm taking tech appointments in store for the phones that rule everyone 's life 
 and i get to this customer mary 
 mary is a very nice woman of perhaps mid 50s to early 60s 
 i walk up and introduce myself and ask what 's going on 
 she tells me that she was in a few days before because her phone kept shutting off and she was about to do a major cross country drive la to nyc by herself and she was worried about her phone not working 
 so when she was in about five days before the battery failed testing 
 worn out 
 this can certainly cause random shut <unk> 
 so they changed the battery 
 at cost cause she was out of warranty 
 only it was still shutting down 
 there 's a set of <unk> board error logs so i took a look 
 holy crap 
 screen after screen of a major error dating back like a month 
 basically this error is the same as a <unk> panic on a computer 
 for those that do n't know computers it 's the 'blue screen of death 
 blown logic board level issue 
 this phone was super critical and lucky to be alive 
 of course this is something the first tech should have caught but having checked to see who it was from the service notes he 's a bit of a lazy ass 
 me i check that log every time 
 i would rather catch an <unk> <unk> before it happens than miss it 
 so i 'm a tad <unk> he 's going to get feedback later 
 now i have to tell the customer that we missed the right call the first time and she has to replace the whole phone 
 for a lot more 
 like $ 300 once you put the tax in 
 but i tell her i 'm going to go talk to my manager about taking off the cost of the battery replacement because that 's just not fair 
 she 's cool with this and with paying the difference 
 i go to my manager and explain what 's up 
 he agrees it 's not fair 
 only he says we 'll just cover the whole thing 
 or <unk> for making her come a second time 
 he did n't have to do this 
 but to him it felt like the right thing to do 
 who was i to argue 
 i get the replacement phone do the paperwork swap the sim etc 
 we get every thing set up on the new phone one the old one <unk> 
 she pulls out her credit card and i tell her i do n't need that 
 she says she has n't paid and i tell her that she does n't have to my manager is going to pay for it since we messed up and did n't fix it the first time 
 she loses it 
 zero to 100 in like two seconds 
 i 'm talking hands shaking snot <unk> tears every where 
 me i go and get some tissues for her to clean up her face no big deal 
 i ask her if she needs hug cause i have few with me 
 she says yes 
 i give her a hug and say happy <unk> day 
 which almost got her crying again 
 my manager happened to walk by right then and gave me a look like 'is everything okay 
 i guess mary picked up on it cause she asked if he was the manager 
 i said yes and she hugged him too 
 tldr : read it and get your daily <unk> this one happened a few days ago 
 i work the customer service desk at a department store 
 lady came up with about three bags of clothes she wants to return 
 the ensuing conversation went something like this : & gt me : do you have your receipt 
 & gt customer : oh no i 've done hundreds of returns here with no receipt 
 & gt m : okay are you a member of our rewards program 
 & gt c : no 
 & gt m : okay so without a receipt i 'll have to give you store credit with a 15 % deduction on each item 
 & gt c : ohhh no 
 no no no 
 i 've done this hundreds of times and i 've never had a problem 
 they always look it up with my credit card 
 at this point she tosses her credit card down on the counter 
 i do n't want in-store credit i want my money back 
 & gt m : no i 'm sorry but the only way we have to look up receipts is if you 're in our rewards program 
 & gt c : no 
 that 's not true 
 i 'm telling you i 've done this over and over again and i 've never had a problem 
 i 'm a decorator i buy crap here all the time 
 i learned a while back that when someone just wo n't accept what you 're saying have another employee confirm it 
 sometimes people just need to hear the same damn information from two people before they even start to accept it 
 so fortunately our store manager was ringing up a customer at the lanes across from where i was 
 i confirm with her that we can in fact not look up receipts using a credit card 
 & gt c : this is ridiculous 
 i 've done this hundreds of times you 're lying to me 
 i just want my money back 
 at this point i notice something odd on one of the <unk> of clothing she 's trying to return : the tag is from a different store 
 & gt m : ma'am let me ask you what store are you trying to return your merchandise to 
 & gt c : what are you talking about 
 & gt m : where did you buy this stuff 
 & gt c : names the store 
 surprise it is n't ours & gt m : ma'am this is insert name of store here & gt c : oh 
 she then storms off in a huff 
 because you know it 's still my fault.i had caught a bad stomach virus one year when i was still a retail drone at a now closed movie store about every 10-15 min i would throw up and poop myself 
 i will be calling the store manager boss 
 so i called in for my shift 7 hours before the shift since i was working the 2nd shift that day 
 i called a left a vm for my boss saying i could n't come in 
 boss called back and left a vm told me i either worked that day or i was fired 
 called pleaded my case no budge 
 seeing as rent was due car payment due and if fired i would n't have been able to pay both 
 i was forced to come in after 10 min i had to run to the bathroom to puke and since i had to leave the register to do this my boss was n't happy and wrote me up for abandoning post 
 told me if it happen again i was going to be let go 
 she put a trash can next to me and said use this if i felt sick 
 so ... not wanting to live homeless the next month i do i was told 
 after about the 7th time i dry heaved in to the trash can my face very pale 
 boss came out and told me to go home i was fired 
 i went home and panicked how i will make rent etc 
 the next day the dm called me and ask how i was feeling i told him better than the day before but not 100 % he told me ok and asked could he see me tomorrow if i was feeling well 
 nothing else to do i said yes 
 the next day i go in to meet him and my now old boss was there to i was thinking this was an exit interview 
 dm ask me what happen i told him i called in 7 hours before and was told i would be fired if i did n't come in to work 
 boss of course denied it saying i was welcome to take an unpaid day off 
 i then played the vm my ex-boss left me 
 she was angry after hearing it i was asked to go out the room for a few mins 
 after 10 min i see my ex-boss walk out the store pissed off tears in her eyes 
 dm calls me in and fills me in it seems that that night when she fired me there was a secret shopper in the line 
 the shopper noted how nice i was despite being obviously too sick to work 
 when the shopper saw me get fired for being too sick to work in front of a line of customer she was outraged and after i left told off the manger and asked for the dm number which the boss refused at first but then gave her the wrong number 
 since she was a secret shopper and knew the correct number to begin with she called the dm that night and told him what went down 
 dm then pull the security tape of that night and confirm the boss handing the trash can and the part about letting me go 
 he told me that he asked my side of the story just for record purposes and i had my job back as well as for my trouble he put 2 days of <unk> on my paycheck for that week 
 best of yet he made one of the shift leads the new <unk> manger and gave me the shift lead spot which bumped my pay up by 2 bucks and hr at the time 
 i 'm a manager at a retail pet supply store 
 i was the manager on duty one evening when i overheard a conversation between a customer and my support manager sm from now on getting a little intense at a cash register 
 the customer was trying to use coupons that she found on some smartphone app that were n't valid and sm was explaining why she could n't accept them 
 there 's several fake coupons circulating right now that are badly photoshopped with no expiration date no description of what the sale is for etc 
 the woman was getting in a <unk> about it so i wandered in that direction in case sm needed assistance 
 i wanted to see how sm would handle the situation so i did n't jump in immediately 
 she was having trouble keeping the woman <unk> and in a bit of desperation offered the woman 20 % off on her most expensive purchase which was a <unk> bag of dog food 
 it was within her power to give a discount if she wanted to -- i do n't know if i would have done it -- but there was nothing wrong with her trying something creative to please a frustrated customer 
 and she *had* only been frustrated up to this point not rude 
 she honestly did n't know the coupons were <unk> before she came in 
 if you genuinely do n't understand something i 'll be nice and helpful all day long but once you show me you do n't value manners my interest in going above and beyond for you <unk> 
 this was the point when the woman decided she was n't having it shouting that other stores had taken the same coupons before which is probably why we got a bolo report on them and starting to get ugly with sm 
 finally she loudly demanded to see a manager despite sm wearing a name badge that said 'manager 
 when sm said she that she was one the woman very rudely demanded to see a manager who knew what they were talking about since obviously you do n't '' 
 that 's when i stepped around from behind her and introduced myself 
 i let the lady talk and explain her situation in her own words 
 i did n't need my co-worker to say anything since we both knew i had heard everything 
 in the end i repeated the same thing to the woman : that we could n't honor the coupons and gave the reasons why 
 she was pissed but i guess since i 'm an <unk> guy and not a petite young woman like sm she decided that arguing with me was n't going to get her anything and she gave up 
 she sighed and said fine 
 this is bs but i guess i 'll just take that 20 % off the dog food since you wo n't take any of your other coupons 
 i hope you know you just lost a lot of business from me '' 
 me : i 'm sorry but i did n't offer you a discount on your dog food '' 
 woman : *that* girl did '' 
 * jabbing a finger angrily at sm * me : yes i did hear her do that 
 i also heard you <unk> her offer because you did n't think she knew what she was talking about 
 you wanted to talk to someone else so now i 'm here and i did n't offer you a discount on anything '' 
 woman : * it took a couple seconds for that to sink in her eyes growing wider in rage 
 * so you 're not going to do anything for me '' 
 me : i 'll happily check you out that 's what i can do for you '' 
 woman : and you 're seriously not going to give me a discount for wasting my time '' 
 me : ma'am you decided to escalate the issue by yelling at my co-worker and rejecting her very generous offer to try to make you happy 
 since you wanted a different answer now you 're getting one 
 would you like us to check you out now '' 
 with a couple curse words under her breath she abandoned her purchases and left the store 
 sm thanked me for having her back and then went on break to <unk> 
 moral of the story : be nice to the people you want help from 
 **edit 1 : ** <unk> an a spellin 's **edit 2 : ** that was by the way *not* the way i would have coached anyone else to handle it 
 the woman called the store the next day and a different manager took the call 
 i got in a tiny bit of trouble over it but in the end my boss had my back too 
 if she had called our corporate customer support line however i probably could have gotten in much deeper trouble 
 worth it to see the look on her face <unk> happened earlier today we were suddenly slammed at the cashier lines at <unk> 
 an old hag who has come through my line and <unk> my day several times before is next in my line 
 behind her are a pair of to be blunt very ghetto looking young black gentlemen 
 as soon as i say hello to ob old bitch her phone rings 
 obnoxiously loud <unk> <unk> fills the air all around us for a solid minute until she manages to dig her phone out of her purse 
 the <unk> young ghetto gentlemen begin <unk> and going apeshit to the tone of the ring 
 when she finally answers she turns to me <unk> and this is how that shit went down : <unk> : ** <unk> phone turns to me* <unk> i do n't care about your card you 're trying to sell or how you 're doing today i have a phone call '' 
 **ygg1 : ** <unk> the put out reaction on my face* <unk> '' **ygg2 : ** <unk> yea we all noticed you had a phone call <unk> people in the back o the store fuckin noticed wit that fuckin loud ass muhfuckin ringtone fuck '' 
 my team lead walks over at this point to see what these guys are yelling about and why the ob had a look of such pure disgust on her face 
 **ygg1 : ** <unk> the team lead is about to say <unk> hey ma'am i 'm gon na have to ask you to be quiet this lady here is on the phone and ca n't be interrupted by your rudeness 
 **ygg2 : ** <unk> <unk> hear that 
 she on the phone be quiet '' some guy two or three lanes down started talking ... **ygg2 : ** *literally skips over to the guy i thought he was about to tackle his ass and puts his finger on the guys lips and whispers* <unk> she on the phone '' **ygg1 : ** tell 'em nigga '' ob : <unk> her filled cart in the line and walks out while apologizing over the phone and giving everyone a shit look* <unk> : ** <unk> forward with <unk> <unk> good lil nigga 
 this is it '' 
 they finished up and left and could not have been more polite lol 
 me and my team lead and everyone just had that that just happened '' expression 
 edit : formatting edit edit : sweet ass thanks for the gold 
 : d an elderly gentleman came in one day and patiently waited for his turn to be helped 
 as soon as i got to him he told me he had an older tv that was n't cable ready and that he needed a cable converter box to make it work 
 he asked if we had one for sale 
 sure '' i told him right over here 
 they cost around $ 80 '' 
 okay what else would i need to make it work '' 
 i showed him to our area with the <unk> for <unk> the cables etc 
 how much will this all cost 
 he asked me 
 well altogether with tax included probably about $ 100 '' 
 okay ... he had the look of someone crunching the numbers in his <unk> look was one of can i afford this '' 
 then i said <unk> before i ring any of this up let me ask you something do you have a newer vcr that 's cable ready 
 one with digital tuning '' 
 yeah but i 'm not using it '' 
 okay here 's what you can do ... '' i then walked him through the process of <unk> the vcr to the tv and using that as a cable converter box instead 
 he looked at me and said god why did n't i think of that '' 
 then he asked if we worked for commission at my store 
 i said that we did and he said so you just talked yourself out of a sale '' 
 well '' i told him it would n't be right to sell you something that you did n't need '' 
 we chatted a while longer and he went on his way 
 about a week later a customer came in and sought me out personally 
 later he told me he only wanted to deal with me because i 'd been honest with his dad 
 over the next month any time his family members needed anything they came to me 
 believe it or not there were actually experiences that made me feel good while working retail.happy ending in this one 
 i work in a general merchandise store and was putting christmas <unk> in the <unk> the top shelves that you typically ca n't reach 
 well i was trying to squeeze a box onto the shelf by slightly nudging it forward little by little when suddenly i see several massive objects fall down into the opposite aisle and i hear a guy on the other side shout oh '' 
 in surprise 
 i shouted oh my god '' 
 and ran to the other side to see what happened 
 as it turns out i had knocked over about five or six large dog beds which next to packing <unk> and the color pink are the most harmless things imaginable 
 they all fell on my customer a 60-something gentleman who was more bemused than anything 
 cue the <unk> apologies and <unk> as to whether he was all right and he said no do n't worry about it i 'm perfectly fine '' 
 then he looks around for any of my co-workers whispers i wo n't tell if you wo n't '' and gives me a wink before walking away 
 sure they were just dog beds but what can i say 
 dude had my <unk> i work in an electronics repair shop where we also buy/sell/trade phones and tablets 
 i got a call on my day off because a new person thought someone was trying to sell something stolen 
 i walk in and a lady is attempting to sell an att ipad air 64gb for $ 50 and does n't remember the password on it 
 i tell her that i would definitely be interested in it but we would have to remove the password 
 i take the device to the back and set it on my desk remove the sim card and write the model number down 
 i walk over to att and find out through the customer service <unk> that the customer that it belongs too had his house robbed an hour earlier and this was one of the items that was stolen 
 i tell them to have the police go to his house and to come to my work and i 'll stall the customer 
 i get back to my store and tell the customer that everything is clean on the tablet and as soon as it is restored i can give her $ 350 for it 
 she of course is ecstatic about it and calls her friends up going can you believe we are getting this much for this 
 i have her fill out paper work saying how much she is selling it for with a copy of her drivers license 
 this is when the police officer walks in 
 she instantly has a fuck '' look on her face and tries to walk away 
 the officer tries to talk to her and she pushes him 
 he grabs her and <unk> her to the ground while she is throwing punches he <unk> her and hand cuffs 
 it ended up that she had in her <unk> this elderly mans wallet with drivers lic. social security card credit cards and other personal stuff 
 tl : dr tried to sell my store stolen merchandise goes to <unk> some of these reminded me of one of my <unk> customers from my past in retail 
 i 'd been working there for well over a year by this point when this happened a guy in a business suit was in my lane looking kind of impatient 
 when he got to me he was incredibly rude towards me even though i was just asking the basic things starting with this rg for rude guy & gt me - hello how are you today 
 & gt rg - none of your business 
 that sent up the initial red flag as i figured ok this guy is n't having too good a day 
 & gt me - alright sir would you like bags today 
 & gt rg - no i 'm going to carry these all 
 what do you think kid 
 another red flag another smile just to not <unk> anything from the dude 
 i did n't even bother mentioning my age cause i sure was not a kid 
 through the rest of his order he is continuing to be increasingly rude toward me to the point i can see he 's enjoying himself 
 finally i ca n't help it and i politely asked him to not speak that way to me since i was just doing my job in ringing him through 
 the response i got still makes me mad to this day & gt rg - and why should i be nice to you 
 you 're the servant and i 'm the customer 
 that makes me better than you so i 'm allowed to treat you like dirt 
 i stopped immediately and just stared at this guy like 'did you seriously just say that 
 he gave me a smug look ... which quickly faded when i grabbed the phone and called my manager over 
 i told the manager i was refusing to serve the rude guy and why before i left my lane 
 the manager allowed me to and i 'm pretty sure he gave the rude guy one hell of a <unk> for it 
 never saw him back in the store after that and did not care a single bit 
 tl dr - guy thought treating cashiers like crap was his right just because we are his <unk> few years ago i worked at this little pizza shop a mom and pop place on the main drag in town 
 and it was small enough that on weekdays it would be just me and sometimes another waitress on the floor 
 so one day it 's just me it 's late in the afternoon and there 's only one family in the restaurant 
 they 're letting their son run around the room while feeding the baby and it 's not a huge deal since there 's only me to bother i would normally ask them to have their child stay with them since we do carry boiling hot cheesy pizza around 
 i 've just gone to ask them something do they want dessert or the check <unk> and i 'm walking away from the table when i realize i 've forgotten to ask them another question 
 so i turn around 
 and my swinging hand just smacks their kid right in the face 
 apparently he was running behind me and just happened to be within arms reach 
 i was mortified and the kid grabs his cheek and tears up runs to his mom and puts his face in her lap and cries like i just killed his puppy 
 i thought for sure i was going to get fired they were going to yell and scream and i 'd have to apologize a thousand times and find a new job 
 but then the most amazing thing happens 
 the mom looks me right in the eye winks at me and says to her son : & gt i told you not to run around the restaurant sweetie 
 stop crying and apologize to the nice waitress for being a hooligan 
 i 'm sure your cheek does n't hurt that much 
 needless to say i was grateful and speechless and i will never forget the day that i <unk> someone 's kid and they did n't yell at <unk> tfr 
 i 've been a long-time lurker but i finally decided to make an account and post some stories from my part-time job at an ice cream franchise 
 it 's my first post so please forgive any formatting mistakes 
 also i apologize in advance for the length 
 <unk> of background : ** my store is n't a typical ice cream place 
 we do n't actually scoop the ice cream for you nor is it self-serve 
 the ice cream or <unk> or yogurt or whatever actually starts out in liquid form then we freeze it into a solid using liquid <unk> 
 it 's a really cool process and most customers especially children love it 
 our story takes place earlier today 
 it was my first day back from a vacation visiting my brother in a different state 
 because he lives very far away and is much older than me we do n't get to see each other much 
 anyway while i was visiting him he bought me a very pretty bracelet shaped like a butterfly important 
 i decided to wear that bracelet to work today 
 the day started out normal enough 
 most of the customers were easy-going most of the children that came in were <unk> you 'd be amazed how many kids treat the store like it 's a playground 
 i thought my shift would go well ... until <unk> came in 
 we 'll call her <unk> face bf ** and her two year old daughter <unk> girl sg ** 
 i greet bf and go up to the counter to take her order 
 & gt **me : ** good afternoon ma'am have you been here before 
 & gt **bf : ** yes 
 & gt **me : ** okay great 
 do you know what i can get for you and your daughter 
 & gt **bf : ** * rather curtly * we have n't decided you do n't need to pester me 
 so that 's how it 's gon na be 
 fine bitch 
 & gt **me : ** * putting on the retail smile we all know and love * of course take your time 
 let me know when you 're ready to order 
 about five minutes later bf calls me over 
 & gt **bf : ** hello 
 excuse me 
 i 'm ready to order now 
 & gt **me : ** yes ma'am what would you like 
 & gt **bf : ** you know it 's really ridiculous that i had to wait five minutes for you to take my damn ice cream order 
 really 
 & gt **me : ** yes ma'am i apologize for the wait 
 i just wanted to ensure that you had enough time to decide 
 what would you like today 
 & gt **bf : ** i do n't want anything you 've ruined my <unk> 
 * seriously 
 * my daughter though wants flavor with topping 
 & gt **me : ** certainly ma'am what size would you like 
 & gt **bf : ** ugh you mean i have to *tell* you the size 
 you do n't just know 
 this went on for a few minutes until bf finally told me the necessary details for her order 
 i mixed the liquid together and proceeded to start freezing it 
 as i began to freeze it sg caught sight of my bracelet 
 & gt **sg : ** mommy 
 mommy 
 a butterfly 
 i want it 
 & gt **bf : ** * to me * where did you get that bracelet 
 i explain to her that my brother gave it to me as a gift and we had purchased from a flea market in his state 
 & gt **bf : ** well my daughter really likes it and i certainly ca n't go to state to buy one 
 * even if you did go it 's one of a kind ... like many things from flea markets 
 * would you give it to her 
 & gt **me : ** * stunned * uh ... i 'm sorry ma'am this bracelet holds a lot of <unk> for me 
 it was given to me by my brother and i do n't see him very often -- & gt **bf : ** yes yes i do n't care about that 
 well if you 're too selfish to give it to her * wat * at least let her wear it for a bit 
 i 'm the customer you 're required to do what i want 
 umm ... no 
 first of all i 've seen the way your child is acting in the store 
 she 's climbing all over the tables knocking shit over behaving like a <unk> on speed 
 i do n't blame the kid for doing this as she does n't know better i blame the mother for not supervising her child in a public place 
 i 'm willing to bet that she would break it ten seconds after i give it to her 
 second it 's my property 
 i can give or refuse to give it to whomever i please 
 third and perhaps most importantly as i already explained to her the bracelet holds a lot of sentimental value for me 
 i would be very upset if she broke it lost it refused to give it back etc 
 & gt **me : ** i 'm sorry ma'am but i will not be giving her my bracelet 
 sg begins to bawl 
 bf leans across the counter nearly spitting in my face 
 & gt **bf : ** why not 
 & gt **sg : ** mommy she does n't know how to share 
 & gt **bf : ** you 've made my child cry you stupid bitch 
 i demand to see your manager 
 *sigh 
 * i go to the back to fetch my manager m who is a really cool lady 
 she 's just a few years older than me and she 's someone that will have your back 
 i try to explain to her what happened but i 'm really upset i 've never had a customer yell at me before 
 she tells me she will handle it and gets me a drink of water 
 she heads out to confront the <unk> 
 both she and bf were talking loudly so i was able to overhear their conversation : & gt **m : ** good afternoon ma'am 
 i see you 've had a problem with lady-targaryen 
 & gt **bf : ** you 're damn right i have a problem with her 
 she made my child cry 
 & gt **m : ** i see 
 and this is because lady-targaryen refused to give your daughter her bracelet is that correct 
 & gt **bf : ** yes 
 what are you going to do about it 
 & gt **m : ** nothing 
 & gt **bf : ** excuse me 
 & gt **m : ** you heard me 
 the jewelry is her property and she has the right to refuse to give it to your daughter 
 i wo n't tolerate abuse of my staff 
 please pay for your ice cream and leave 
 i cracked the door open and bf 's face was priceless 
 she <unk> paid for her ice cream and left with her bratty child in tow 
 all that over a $ 10 bracelet ... wow 
 **tl dr : bitch comes in demands i give her daughter my bracelet 
 i say no she demands to see manager manager tells her off 
 ** let me tell you another story that happened earlier today 
 background : i manage a store which sells coffee and loose leaf tea in bulk 
 we also sell <unk> <unk> chocolate fudge liquorice ... you get the picture 
 we have a large glass display with about 18-20 different kinds of chocolate pralines 
 usually the customer tells me which one they want and i pick them out and put them in a bag or a box 
 the different kinds are <unk> labeled with flavour and/or <unk> 
 & gt <unk> man about 40 years old walks up to the <unk> & gt me : hi there can i help you with something 
 & gt man : no i 'm just looking & gt me : okay let me know if you need help & gt <unk> <unk> around the store cleaning a little bit and helping some other customers i would say about ten minutes <unk> & gt man : alright i want a box of eight chocolates please & gt me : sure which do you want 
 & gt man : is it chocolate in all of these 
 <unk> to the display marked chocolate pralines '' \* & gt me : yes all of these are chocolate & gt man : is it dark chocolate in the dark nougat 
 & gt me : yes it 's dark chocolate and dark nougat & gt man : okay one please 
 what kind of mousse is it in the one with raspberry mousse 
 & gt me : ... raspberry ... & gt man : okay one please 
 and that white one with orange is that dark chocolate 
 & gt me : no that is white chocolate 
 & gt man : hmm 
 okay one of those 
 is it <unk> in the blueberry one 
 & gt me : yes of course blueberry flavoured chocolate 
 & gt : man : one please 
 aaaaaand <unk> ... does the one with tiramisu taste like tiramisu 
 & gt me : yes like tiramisu and chocolate & gt man : one please 
 is it really champagne in the one with strawberries and champagne 
 like liquid 
 & gt me : no it is champagne flavoured chocolate inside it 
 & gt man : one please 
 that one with <unk> is white is that also white chocolate 
 & gt me : yes & gt man : one please 
 and the one with mint is <unk> 
 & gt me : yes & gt man : one please 
 little did he know i <unk> him 
 it 's gravel in the blueberry chocolate arsenic in the orange ones and the ones with tiramisu are actually full of snakes 
 i build my business on lies 
 hello tfr another story from big box electronic store 
 relevant background to the story : i 'm half filipina and have grown up around a big filipino family 
 though i do n't speak it passed basic phrases i still understand it perfectly 
 since i 'm a <unk> other half is japanese-white most people ca n't tell i 'm filipina 
 anyway i work in the camera department and in walks filipina lady with her son 
 she informs me that she came from one of our other stores because they were out of stock of the camera she wanted 
 on top of that she saw it from another company for a cheaper price and wanted me to price match it 
 alright no problem 
 managers let me price match/give discounts at my own discretion and i 'm usually generous when it comes to this depending on how <unk> a customer is 
 i told her i need to look it up to confirm it is actually that price at the other company 
 so i walk them up to my computer and right as i 'm typing it in she says to her son ... **lady : in tagalog this girl is stupid 
 ** i snapped my head towards her 
 she looked like a deer caught in the headlights 
 apparently i 'm stupid because i did n't know off the top of my head how much the camera is at the other company 
 you can insult my looks and pretty much anything about me but not my intelligence 
 especially if it 's on an <unk> basis 
 i decided not to say anything then and acted like nothing was wrong but i could tell she was worried that i understood her 
 **me : well yup i see it here for $ xxx.xx 
 i 'll pull out the camera for you 
 ** i pull out the camera and <unk> the shit out of her with unnecessarily expensive accessories 
 i finally get them up to the register and give her the total at full price 
 **lady : are n't you going to price match the camera 
 ** then i slowly pursed my lips into a sweet smile 
 **me : normally i would but i 'm so stupid i forgot how to do it 
 ** the woman looked horrified 
 she paid full price and left in a hurry 
 yeah i admit it was petty but fuck her 
 edit : i hate to be this guy but ... holy crap 
 i never imagined someone would give me gold 
 thanks guys 
 reddit and this sub in particular have helped me through a tough time at the moment 
 thanks so much 
 i have been lurking this subreddit for quite a long time and decided it was finally time to start sharing my stories 
 please excuse any formatting errors be gentle 
 this will be <unk> background : i grew up in the pet store business 
 my dad moved us around a lot buying stores that were failing and then turning them around to re-sell 
 flipping them essentially 
 the last one we stayed in for many years so i have tons of stories 
 growing up in retail led to a steady string of other retail jobs as well so i will have plenty of stories to share 
 this is one of my favorites 
 the most common theme i see in tfr is the <unk> to be able to tell the shitty customers exactly what you think 
 this made working for my dad a great time 
 my dad is an amazing man 
 5 minutes talking to him and he would have you writing him a check to purchase your own car from him 
 he could sell anything to anyone 
 he also gave zero f 's what anyone thought of him or what he had to say 
 when customers threatened never to come back '' he would clear their items from the counter and show them to the door 
 he was <unk> and <unk> a bit on the crazy side 
 one of the big problems in the pet store business is much of your inventory is alive and people especially children love teasing and poking at the animals 
 this is not only <unk> to the animals but also creates a liability risk 
 anyone in the pet store industry will tell you that no amount of danger : do not touch '' signs will stand up against a lawsuit 
 which brings us to our wonderful customer 
 we will call her liar liar or ll '' 
 her obnoxious young child likely 7 or 8 years old will be called oc '' 
 i will be me '' and dad will be dad '' 
 so late afternoon ll and oc come into our store to browse '' and likely just kill time 
 or perhaps buy a can of fish food 
 from the time they enter ll has zero idea where oc is and what he is doing 
 this kid is out of control 
 knocking things off of shelves 
 running 
 just a little asshole 
 meanwhile ll is oblivious and browsing 
 our store was decent sized for an independent pet store and we had the best fish room in the state built by myself - shameless plug but hey i am still proud after all these years 
 so ll is off in the fish room while oc makes his way to the exotic birds section 
 another of our <unk> 
 there were many very sweet and very expensive birds there and we were quite protective of them 
 oc is being very loud 
 yelling at the birds etc 
 i come by and catch him poking at a very sweet amazon <unk> that we had purchased from a family who could not keep her very recently and she was still <unk> 
 this bird was sweet and talked like crazy 
 this was the only time i heard her scream 
 i took a play straight from dad 's playbook and asked oc where his parents were 
 he said he did n't know 
 so i led him to the front counter and instructed him to stay there with an employee while i located his mother 
 when i found his mother i explained to her what had happened and that he was no longer allowed to roam our store unattended as he was a danger to himself and our animals 
 she storms to the front grabs her child and leaves in a huff 
 i should mention here that the conversation with ll took place in the fish room 
 directly on the other side was dad 's office and the tops are open not full walls 
 a couple of hours later ll calls and asks to speak to the owner 
 call gets transferred to dad and happened as follows : ll : i was in your store with my son and your employee was very rude to both of us 
 he said terrible things about my son swore at him and me grabbed my son by the arm and threw us both out of your store 
 i want him fired 
 i was prepared to spend a <unk> dollars at your store 
 dad : i am very sorry to hear that 
 please give me some time to get to the bottom of it and give me a call back tomorrow 
 what ll did n't know was that dad had witnessed oc 's behavior saw me escort him to the counter and then <unk> to his office where he heard our entire interaction 
 next day ll calls back for dad ... ll : i called yesterday and i want to know if that employee has been fired 
 i will call the bbb blah blah blah 
 dad : well ... i was gon na deal with this while on the phone with you yesterday but i thought a day for you to come to your senses may have helped you 
 i see that it did n't 
 i saw your child destroying my store and my property 
 i saw him <unk> my animals 
 i saw the employee my son lead him to the counter and speak with him respectfully 
 i saw you ignoring your child while he destroyed my property and further i heard the entire exchange between my <unk> and yourself 
 so i thought about firing him but then i realized that you and your child are both assholes and i would prefer you never enter my store again 
 thank you for the customer feedback 
 fuck off 
 *click* my dad was the best 
 if you want to hear more i would be glad to post more 
 maybe next will be the time that he chased a customer out to his car ... edit : when dad chased a customer to his car ... edit : i am so glad you guys love this story 
 i have so many more and it makes me feel so good to remember him this way 
 yet to come ... directing traffic in a busy intersection just to see if people would do what he said ... mashed potatoes in an employee 's ear while they were speaking to a customer 
 seriously 
 he never quit 
 if i could only learn to live like he did 
 last edit : i have gotten a few comments about how extreme my dad 's behavior was 
 i just want to say that i agree 
 it was extreme and he was out of his <unk> mind 
 but what made him great was that he said what he felt and did what he chose 
 he never let other 's opinions of him affect him 
 not once 
 he lived life on his his terms and did the things most of us wish we could do 
 he went where he wanted 
 he took chances 
 at 42 years old and playing it safe my entire adult life i am now trying to learn to live as he did 
 he is the most amazing and strongest person i have ever known 
 some of his <unk> sound crazy 
 as his only child i am here to tell you that they were all far beyond crazy 
 but he lived life 
 i work produce in a higher end grocery store 
 the following took place on a weekday afternoon a few weeks ago 
 i was stocking something when a middle aged lady in glasses called me over 
 not obnoxiously just sort of caught my attention and raised her fingers next to her head smiling all the time 
 i asked if i could help her 
 yes are these apples organic '' 
 she asks 
 the sign says so 
 yup they 're organic '' 
 i point to the sign 
 she <unk> up her face and shakes her head a little 
 but they 're from chile '' 
 yeah organic apples from chile 
 it 's the off season for apples so that 's where we 're getting this variety of organic apple from '' 
 she screws her face up further 
 long pause 
 but they 're from chile '' 
 not sure what she wants here 
 yeah organic apples 
 from chile 
 that 's where we get this variety of organic apple from this time of year '' 
 how can they be organic if they are from chile '' 
 she asks next 
 the orchard would have to be certified to grow organic apples and that certification would have to be approved by the usda or else they could n't sell them as organic in the us '' 
 i say 
 she shakes her head again 
 see you do n't know about those other countries 
 they could just say that these are organic '' 
 they ca n't be imported and sold as organic unless they meet usda organic requirements '' 
 looking to just end this i offer let me go get the box for you '' 
 i run into the back and grab a box top from the back stock 
 same variety same orchard 
 has all the information including a prominent usda certified organic label 
 she inspects the box 
 but how do i know i can trust the usda '' 
 well it 's the government agency that certifies all <unk> labeled produce for sale in the us '' 
 the government 
 like i should trust the government 
 these are from chile '' 
 she hands me the box top back 
 i 'm not entirely sure what she wants from me here 
 this all just seems kinda <unk> 
 do n't you think '' 
 she says <unk> in <unk> 
 at this point i 've dropped retail politeness 
 no i do n't think so '' 
 another long pause as she stares at me 
 i mean you know how those people are 
 you ca n't trust them '' 
 why would that be '' 
 i asked 
 you know 
 it 's just in their nature to ... you know '' 
 she 's acting like we 're good <unk> sharing a joke 
 no i do n't know '' 
 she stares at me for another long awkward moment 
 she then laughs some like she 's trying to cover up her last statement 
 she then just sort of shuffled off 
 yesterday i was on the phone when this a 2 1/2 year old comes <unk> up to the counter 
 she waited patiently for me to finish and then asked mumble mumble <unk> bar bar '' 
 i looked at her mother for help 
 she wants to know if you have any berenstain bears books '' 
 i said oh 
 i think so 
 let 's go look '' 
 i came around the counter and she grabbed my hand 
 adorable 
 the kid was wearing a pink hello kitty shirt camouflage pants and pink <unk> hello kitty shoes 
 i told her i <unk> her fashion sense 
 we hunkered down in the kids books to hunt out the <unk> berenstain bears books 
 i sell used and new books and the kids section defies organization 
 i try to keep everything corralled but if i leave it for an hour it <unk> into chaos 
 so i told the little girl to look with me and we made kind of a game out of it 
 we found her books plus a few extra and chatted <unk> about kitty shoes and <unk> the <unk> and how bears are <unk> at camping 
 when kids are awesome or at least not <unk> <unk> i generally give them stickers 
 i had been cleaning out the back room and found the treasure box that was left over from a <unk> promotion we did 
 it 's full of cheap toys candy and for some reason packages of cheese balls 
 i let her pick something out from the treasure box and she went right for the cheese balls 
 cheese balls '' 
 she exclaimed 
 i said that sounds like a battle cry 
 cheese balls '' 
 and i punched my fist into the air 
 so she punches her little fist in the air and yells cheese balls '' 
 then she runs down the aisle <unk> cheese balls '' 
 later her mom left me a message on facebook saying that while her daughter always loved reading she had never had as much fun picking out books before 
 she had pronounced our bookstore the best one ever and had been yelling cheese balls '' 
 after she finished each book 
 i love my <unk> just recently started posting and realized how many crazy things have happened to me in all the years i 've worked in retail 
 i 've gotten good responses on my stories so far 
 y'all are awesome 
 on to the story 
 i was working for a well known cell phone company as a <unk> tech 
 in a rich white neighborhood 
 a lot of these ladies are mean as fire and their children are just as bad sometimes worse 
 this kid was worse 
 her mother even though she had a expensive looking <unk> and salon style blonde hair looked <unk> 
 the little girl who was about 9 or 10 immediately caused a scene in my store 
 my other co-worker was out to lunch so i received no back up against the little monster 
 little girl ** <unk> ** mom ** m ** me ** me ** **lg** *i want this one 
 i want this one 
 * pointing to the most high end phone we have that just came on the market the week before 
 **m : ** <unk> why do n't we start you out with an older model to see how you do with it you already have an ipod and a tablet..* **lg** reaching an <unk> that could potentially <unk> glass *i want this one 
 * **m : ** sighing and turning to me *can we <unk> expensive phone on blah account i go in the back to grab the device out of inventory **me : ** *we have gold silver ... .* **lg : ** still screaming <unk> 
 i want gold 
 * i start the process of putting the phone onto the account and setting up the device 
 **me : ** to the mother she refused to put insurance on the device for some insane reason *well i highly recommend a case these phones can be easily <unk> **lg** *no i want everyone to see its gold 
 * **me : ** to the mother *we have clear <unk> **lg : ** *no 
 * the mother tried to convince her daughter to no avail to put a case on the phone but eventually gives up 
 i finish the sale and the little girl starts jumping around the store with her new phone 
 her mother <unk> says goodbye and they walk out of the store 
 right as they get outside the little girl swings herself in a circle and the phone goes flying out of her hands straight into the concrete 
 both of them freeze and turn <unk> 
 then the little girl starts to scream 
 the mother looks back at me with wide eyes and i just shrug 
 the phone was completely shattered the screen still worked but they had to make a trip to the repair store so the mom could pay another hundred something dollars to have the screen <unk> i 'm sure the kid screamed the entire way 
 i work at a gas station and because it 's family owned and i 'm the son of the owner i get to have a lot of leeway with giving customers discounts and i like to help people out a bit and i use that leeway a lot anyway a woman comes in today and buys 2 packs of cigarettes a king size candy bar a 20 ounce coke so i give her the three pack deal price on the cigarettes and instead of the candy and drink being <unk> each i just give it to her for $ 3 even making the total $ 16 even well when i tell her the total she says that 's not right that 's way too much 
 so i tell her how i did it i tell her i charged $ <unk> for each pack of cigarettes and $ 1.50 each for the pop and candy 
 she however is still adamantly refusing to believe that that is the correct price 
 she asks to see my manager 
 well i pretty much am the manager and i do n't feel like dealing with this 
 so instead i tell her you know what 
 you 're right- i charged you the wrong price '' 
 so i recalculate the total to $ 17.18 and i tell her i had given her a discount originally 
 she realized her mistake and asked for the lower price 
 i told her if she does n't like this price then she 'll have to go somewhere else even with the <unk> price we 're still cheaper than the gas stations around us 
 she sulked and paid for her stuff without saying a word that 's a victory in my booksi was working the register one day when a customer comes up and everything about him tells me he is one angry customer one i wo n't be meeting again.. or so i thought 
 he 's pretty much huffing and puffing before i even say hi and something tells me i 'll know why in about 2 seconds 
 our store is very focused on customer satisfaction and we 'll do just about anything to get them happy so i put on a smile and greet him : me : hi did you get an ordernumber from one of my <unk> 
 him : this is outrageous i should n't have to bring the price for the item i 'm buying this is unacceptable 
 me : as i 'm taking the paper with his order from his hand i 'm sorry what happened 
 him : his raised voice now gathering some interest from other customers i visited your website and the price there is 10 $ less than here in the store 
 me : i 'm very sorry we probably have n't changed the <unk> yet but the price of your order is the same as online 
 him : that does n't matter it 's fraud 
 me : but the price for the product you 're buying is the same as the online price and if it had n't been we 'd be more than happy to match that price 
 i 'm sorry for any inconvenience but this is the same price that you saw online 
 him : that 's not the point it was more expensive 
 you should tell your manager you are committing fraud 
 me : my patience wearing thin sir i am the manager and we will always match any price you find online including prices from competitors but sometimes we have special deals online 
 we do not claim to always have the same price online as we do in out store but if you as a customer find the same product anywhere else and tell us we are more than happy to give you that price as a thank you for giving us your business 
 if we did promise to have the exact same price in our stores as we do online but did n't that would be breaking <unk> laws but it would not be considered fraudulent 
 i used to study law and usually i would just smile and nod but as he was now screaming and a line was forming so i had a vain hope that he would calm down if i spoke to him him : not fraudulent 
 are you serious 
 i am a lawyer i have driven here all the way from my house in affluent area of town and do n't you think i know what fraud is you have no right to tell me i am wrong and i will go to the papers with your fraud ... '' after this i just gave up 
 he was on his way out the door still screaming about our fraud '' and i took a deep breath and turned to my next customer 
 fast forward 2 months : i 'm long <unk> to meet my so 's family and as we 've moved in together it 's about time 
 i 'm nervous as hell cause i 'll meet them all at once and i do n't know anyone there 
 but as it turns out i 've met my so 's grandfather before.. i left my scan-gun on my buggy while i got a bike down and when i turned around it was gone 
 i look everywhere and no go 
 either a manager or associate stole it we have a limited amount and someone will always take it so i 'm a bit miffed 
 suddenly i see a lady in bright red walking over to the hardware department with my scan-gun in her hand 
 i confront her and she has a fit about how theres nothing that says associate use '' on there and how theres no price checkers in this store 
 i explain to her how it 's associate use only and we have price checkers in 3 different departments or she can ask an associate to scan the price for her behind a register 
 no good she starts flipping out claiming it 's fair use because it was on a cart and nobody was using it therefore it should be hers 
 again i tell her the options she has for price checking and she does n't want to hear it 
 i 'm about to get a manager over here because she wo n't let up 
 another lady approaches a young girl i 'd say <unk> she calls the lady mom and begs her to go because she 's tired and does n't feel good '' 
 the lady calms down but swears she 'll never shop at this rotten store again 
 the little girl silently words sorry '' as they 're leaving 
 sometimes i wonder ... i work part-time as a cashier at a grocery store 
 i enjoy my job because i get to meet so many different people and learn about cooking and food subjects i know very little about 
 that said you guys know what the pay is like 
 happiness does n't pay the rent 
 yesterday i checked my bank account and saw that i have to make $ <unk> stretch another week til payday 
 i turn 29 next week and this is my life 
 my customers ask me if i 'm in school which is a fair question but i got both a college degree and a trade school certification 7 years ago 
 i 'm embarrassed that my peers are climbing the ladder at their companies and i 'm sacking groceries wearing an oversized polo shirt 
 yesterday was a tough day and i felt really depressed when i clocked in 
 but a french woman and her wonderful daughter turned it all around 
 a mom and her 8 year old daughter approached my counter with an overflowing cart and the mom pulled out a collection of huge re-usable bags 
 mom <unk> herself next to me behind the counter ready to bag her groceries and the little girl said i want to scan '' 
 and reached into the cart and started scanning bar codes like a pro 
 my first thought was oh no 
 she 's going to mess something up '' 
 but my coworker and i both helped her by handing her items with bar codes and passed them to her mother who filled up her bags and we had a little assembly line going 
 it was fun 
 when we got to the fruits and vegetables that must be weighed i took over because i thought she could n't do it but then i remembered that she was born into a world with <unk> and this would n't be hard for her 
 so i invited her back around and showed her how to find the <unk> numbers and type them in and she just had the time of her life standing on her tip <unk> ringing up produce 
 finally she rang up the last item and i showed her how to tear the receipt which she proudly handed to her mom across the counter 
 an older man was next in line and i was afraid he would complain about the extra wait time 
 instead he said : & gt '' that was fun 
 you know what that mom was teaching her daughter 
 she was teaching her that all work is honorable no matter what it is '' 
 sometimes i need to be reminded too 
 last night i got to witness some great stupidity in action 
 as i was going to take my break security flew past me and stopped some woman at the door 
 she made a huge scene but they took her off to the back and called the cops 
 as i was coming back from break the police show up 
 i of course returned to work i was not getting involved with the situation 
 about 10 minutes pass and a woman walks up to me and asks if she could speak to a manager 
 i call a manager and they come out to talk to her 
 turns out the shop lifter was a 16 year old girl stealing makeup 
 the woman was her mom who was contacted by police to get her daughter who was just given a no trespass order and a <unk> to appear in court 
 the day passed on without anything out of the ordinary 
 towards the end of my shift i was talking to one of our security and said i saw them bust the girl earlier that day 
 he then tells me it got better than that and he told me the story 
 the mother was taken to the back of the store by the manager and the police were still processing the girl they busted 
 the mother was asked to wait and told it would be 10 to 15 minutes while they did the paperwork 
 the mother asked if she could get a few things and was told it was ok. the mother is walked back to the sales floor and shops around 
 while shopping she was being followed by another security worker 
 the woman grabbed some groceries and went by our hair care section and got a brush and a 60 dollar hair <unk> 
 she then proceeded to unbox the <unk> and shove it in her purse 
 security stopped her there and took her to the back 
 the police did not appreciate the extra work and apparently the mother was busted before stealing at a different store 
 so they decided to arrest her outright 
 the father was contacted and he came in to get his daughter 
 the father was pissed off and had asked the cops for a copy of both the <unk> 
 the dad was going to use it to his advantage to get custody of the daughter 
 the mother apparently was caught stealing so many times the father divorced her for it 
 i was told the dad was on the phone with his lawyer about getting full custody while he was taking his daughter out of the store 
 one hell of a day for security 
 my story requires a little bit of a prelude to know how things work in the restaurant i work at 
 i work at a mongolian grill all you can eat buffet 
 there is a huge buffet of raw vegetables means and sauces 
 you throw what you want in a bowl and bring it up to the grill 
 we fit about 14 meals on the grill at a time and everyone stands in line waiting for their meal to be cooked 
 when it is almost done we go to the first meal on the grill and offer teriyaki to the first person in line and then the second and so on 
 fairly regularly people decide not to stand in line and then fail to correct us if we are pointing at a meal that does n't belong to them and ask if they want teriyaki on said meal 
 so mistakes happen 
 enter <unk> 
 <unk> is here with her family 
 all their meals are on the grill but she does not stay in order but switches with her son 
 her son wants teriyaki she does not 
 but being switched she gets it 
 she points out the mistake and the cook fortunately i was not cooking at this time while normally i would be apologizes profusely and offers her another bowl 
 she refuses the bowl and proceeds to curse about what a fucking moron he is doing so loudly so the whole restaurant can hear 
 she refuses to eat although her family sits down to eat 
 she complains loudly the entire meal 
 when they go to pay she complains to the hostess and she offered to comp their drinks 
 the woman demanded that their food be free because of the terrible service they received 
 the hostess tells her the cook offered you another bowl they tried to fix the problem no one treated you horribly '' 
 the woman <unk> something like i 'm going to get online and write a terrible review of this place '' 
 the hostess smiles at her and says good 
 you do that '' probably holding back laughter at the woman by this point 
 and then out of nowhere and right over her son she punched the hostess square in the face 
 then her and her family left 
 one of the <unk> ran outside and got the license plate number 
 not only that they paid with a <unk> 
 so it was easy to track her down 
 the police arrested her and the hostess pressed charges 
 what 's really great is that a few months before that hostess had been in a car accident that fucked up her neck and it was n't healed yet 
 that punch which normally one could take quite well sent her physical therapy back to stage 1 which made it count as a new injury which made that woman 's punch assault 
 and that punch being thrown over her child counted as child <unk> 
 the best part ... she was a special needs teacher 
 and with a felony charge you ca n't work with kids so as a result she also lost her job 
 i 'm shocked anyone could be that aggressive 
 more so that such a person worked with kids 
 but i am extremely happy her life is completely fucked up now 
 edit : i meant it became a felony not that it became an assault 
 my <unk> worked at a furniture store 
 but instead of selling furniture i worked at the restaurant in the front 
 a little context 
 we have a thing called the family card which is basically a loyalty/rewards card 
 when you get a new family card you get one free frozen yogurt an ice cream at the restaurant at the front where i worked 
 to get this card you just need to type at least your name dob and email at an automated vending machine 
 it is not checked so you can just come here and make one with a fake name and email and choose a dob that is over 18. so one day a mom arrives with three kids 
 she will be smartass sa and i will be me : & gt me : hi how are you <unk> & gt sa : three frozen <unk> please 
 well at least she said please '' 
 & gt me : okay that will be $ <unk> 
 & gt sa : *hands me three of the coupons that come with the <unk> & gt sa : do i still need to pay tax on these 
 & gt me : ... looking at the timestamp on the coupons they were just made that day a few minutes apart from each other 
 they could n't be for her kids the terms & amp conditions clearly say anyone over the age of 18 can join <unk> family '' 
 bitch two can play at this game 
 & gt me : who do these cards belong to 
 & gt sa : umm ... that one 's mine and the other two belong to my friends 
 & gt me : these were made a few minutes ago 
 are your friends still here 
 & gt sa : i ... uhh ... i ... can i see your manager 
 & gt me : i am the manager 
 & gt sa : fine 
 *hands me a credit <unk> <unk> for <unk> i was younger i worked in a pet shoppe for about 6 years 
 this was an on and off again position based on both the store 's and my need for work 
 while i was there a young homeless gentlemen named daniel started coming in to the pet shoppe to get food for his pup 
 it was an adorable teenage german shepherd girl who was way too friendly and derpy 
 the guy was really kind and that store has always <unk> to the poor or down <unk> more then any other store i know of 
 my boss the owner was a former drug addict and so she always hired people who just needed to work and did her best to take care of her home community through the store 
 she gave him a collar leash and some food for the pup 
 in thanks he started coming in and cleaning every once and a while and she <unk> by buying him lunch more like a massive meal each time 
 this became a regular thing 
 the owner then started ordering good quality but cheap pet food and charging homeless people only the cost of ordering it 
 same for collars and <unk> 
 then she started a drive for people to donate to cover the cost of those items so someone in need could come in and get their pet something to eat 
 daniel continued to come in and clean 
 after a few months we had a drive to donate blankets and coats to the homeless with the promise of 20 % off their order if they brought in something as long as it was n't garbage basically other pet stores started doing this too just to maintain foot traffic 
 and still daniel continued to clean 
 within a year every pet store in town had homeless drives or free supplies to pets of homeless people 
 the local vet started offering free puppy shots to the homeless since we had started doing that as well as everything else 
 this was all because of daniel was just trying to earn a decent meal and take care of his pup 
 one day a homeless man came in really young and honestly likely still high 
 he asked to speak with the owner this was common and so my boss comes down 
 all he said was that daniel was dead 
 he was gone this kind young man who was on a downside but was working to <unk> his life 
 he overdosed the night before 
 sure enough the derpy german shepherd pup was sitting outside she was now much too large for the store just kind of sadly staring at the blank wall across the street 
 the guy asked for a sandwich not understanding how daniel had worked for a meal but just assumed that the boss gave them out but the boss gave him her own food and went back inside with the <unk> pup 
 the guy did n't want the dog so my boss took her home 
 years later the town is now in the process of building a safe homeless park '' 
 just a <unk> place to sleep but it 's specifically designed to help people stay dry and warm on wet nights 
 this town went from <unk> to support for the homeless in a little over a year though the park is very new and all this happened 5 years ago all because of daniel 
 i just hope that he knows what an impact he made wherever he is 
 **update : ** thank you to the person who gave me gold because they thought it was a true golden tale '' 
 i 've never received gold but it was touching to find it so thank you especially because i did n't earn it but because daniel did 
 i will be <unk> this to <unk> shortly as was recommended but please give me time to do so 
 : i 'm really grateful for all the positive feedback my boyfriend yelled at me when i was posting this in the morning because i took so long 
 however that was only because today we were moving and i was in bed on reddit an hour after i was supposed to be ready 
 he then apologized after i just opened this to over 1700 upvotes while at dinner after we finished moving for the day 
 he laughed and i clapped and i 'm sure the other customers in the <unk> restaurant thought we were crazy 
 the usual.i worked at a bookstore 
 the phone rang and i answered it 
 & gt caller : hi i wanted to see if you have a book 
 & gt me : sure what 's the title 
 & gt caller speaking slowly : it 's called a <unk> of <unk> '' by john <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> & gt me : yes we do have that 
 let me put you on hold for a second to make sure it 's on the shelf 
 i go to the shelf and pick up 2 copies a hardback and a paperback 
 then i return to the call 
 & gt me : yes it 's here 
 we have a hardback for $ 35.95 and a paperback for $ 19.95 
 do you want me to hold one of those for you 
 & gt caller speaking in a way that suggests he 's writing this down : okay you have a hardback for $ 35.95 and a paperback for $ 21.95 
 & gt me : no no 
 $ 19.95 
 & gt caller : $ <unk> 
 & gt me : no $ 19.95 
 & gt caller : $ 21.95 & gt me slowly : no it 's 19 dollars and 95 cents 
 & gt caller : $ <unk> 
 & gt me loud and clear as i can : $ 19.95 
 & gt caller : $ 21.95 
 & gt me : yes that 's correct 
 should i hold the paperback for you 
 & gt caller : i 'd like the hardback 
 i do n't remember anything after that because i blacked out 
 alright time for update 2. for those just joining in on this <unk> this is the first post and this is the second post 
 so basically 2 big things happened today and i will try to explain them in as much detail as possible 
 1 i woke up bright and early and made a call to corporate 
 my plan here was simply to state that i needed my issue <unk> further even if it seemed like there was no problem on their end 
 as expected the person on the other end of the phone told me the same thing that they had already told me the first time i had called 
 but then i said the magic word <unk> 
 as soon as i made the calm yet firm threat the person immediately told me to hold on for a second 
 he got his supervisor on the line to whom i explained my situation once again and he assured me that he would see into the matter 
 oh and i also asked for a way to e-mail the president of the company and i sent an e-mail to him explaining my situation as well 
 so that was that but i did n't stop there 
 see i had another plan i was going to catch my manager myself red-handed 
 you know just in case corporate <unk> <unk> 
 2 so i walk into work and i immediately go into the manager 's office 
 i stand in front of him and the conversation goes like this : **me** : i have to speak with you about something really important 
 **manager** : can it wait 
 i need to finish looking over these documents before 12 
 **me** : no it ca n't wait 
 <unk> 's name** told me that my clock in and clock out time from lunch 3 days ago was not on the log 
 i know i punched out and in so what happened 
 **manager** : huh ... weird 
 i 'll look into it for ya alright 
 **me** : oh no need 
 i already called corporate and they said they 'd look into it personally 
 at this point i had the widest shit-eating grin i have ever had in my life 
 it felt good man 
 <unk> fucking good 
 the manager audibly <unk> at this point no doubt shitting <unk> 
 **manager** : you know that was n't really necessary 
 you could have come to me about this first 
 **me** : oh i know but i just did n't want to waste your time seeing as how you 're always busy and all 
 you have more important things to do like look over documents 
 at this point he visibly begins to get annoyed by my attitude and my sarcastic tone 
 but i 'm just enjoying it way too much 
 **manager** : now listen tomato_ketchup i 'm not really liking your tone right now 
 **me** : i apologize 
 anyways i just wanted to give you a heads up in case corporate asks you any questions 
 you know how they are 
 at this point some of you might be thinking why i said that last part 
 why 
 because i had a <unk> suspicion that since he is a <unk> manager 3 months now he probably did n't know that the system logs all deletions and <unk> 
 sure you would be told this if you become manager but i was trying my luck at this point because a i do n't see who else could have deleted my log times and b if it was him who deleted them he obviously did n't know about the fact that the deletions are tracked 
 so what was my <unk> here 
 simple 
 i was hoping that due to this threat about corporate he would simply go back and <unk> my times back onto the log 
 and guess what 
 he did *just* that 
 a couple of minutes after our conversation he comes up to me and tells me : **manager** : tomato_ketchup i found out what the problem was 
 there was a <unk> in the system and apparently it did n't register your punches 
 but everything is fixed now 
 your log times should be there now 
 **me** : wow thanks 
 i appreciate it 
 **manager** : no problem ... but wait a minute there 's more 
 just a couple of hours into my shift i see the manager leaving the store angrily slamming the manager office 's door on his way out 
 when i asked my supervisor buddy what had happened the conversation went like this : **me** : dude why is he so angry 
 **supervisor** : i do n't know 
 he was with corporate on the phone for a few minutes and then he asked me why i told you that the time logs were missing 
 hold up let me find out 
 so my supervisor runs out the front doors to catch up with my manager 
 they talk for a while outside after which my manager gets into his car and angrily drives off 
 then my supervisor comes back inside walks up to me and says : **supervisor** : dude 
 i 'm sorry to tell you this but he 's fucked 
 corporate found evidence of data <unk> in the punch-in log 
 apparently he deleted your times yesterday and added them back today this morning to cover his ass 
 **me** : wow ... **supervisor** : yep ... **me** : how did n't he know about the system 's ability to track that stuff 
 **supervisor** : i do n't know man 
 so there 's that 
 he will probably get fired and i will probably ... well keep my job 
 i could not have done with without you guys or your support and i certainly could not have come up with half of the ideas or thought processes that got me out of this hole 
 and for those of you saying that i should have just let it be instead of causing more problems 
 no 
 that is **not** how you do things when someone is trying to *fuck* with your life 
 thanks again for all your support 
 i hope i have more stories to share with you all in the near future hopefully <unk> and not <unk> 
 tomato_ketchup signing off 
 peace 
 **edit** : wow 
 thanks for the gold 
 totally unexpected my bakery started offering our cakes on discount from now until christmas 
 most of our customers love that but some are nothing but suspicious 
 i had to deal with one of them yesterday 
 so you lowered the price huh '' 
 yes they will be on discount until christmas '' but are they the same cakes you used to make '' 
 of course they are exactly the same '' 
 did you change the cream you use '' 
 no we did n't change anything they are the same as you know them '' 
 well ... ok ... i guess i 'll buy one '' 
 she chose one from our ready ones but she still <unk> 
 it 's fresh is n't it '' 
 of course it 's excellent '' 
 are you <unk> it 's fresh '' 
 oh yes it was made this morning it 's perfect '' 
 the people i am taking it to know cakes '' 
 what do you mean ma'am '' 
 they will know if it 's fresh or not '' ok i told you it 's perfectly fresh '' you know there will be children there and they will eat from this cake '' 
 it 's fresh i promise 
 look i would n't give you something old the discount is simply promotional 
 we do n't just make cakes let them get old and *then* sale them on discount 
 we 're offering it for every cake from now until christmas '' 
 i 'm not sure she was convinced but she finally left 
 one time i had a man ringing through my cash and i got a genuine headache from interacting with him 
 & gt customer : i heard if you tell the cashier you want 50 % off they have to give it to you 
 & gt me : ha ha that would be great would n't it 
 & gt customer : so is it 50 % off 
 i want 50 % off 
 & gt me : nope there 's no sales today sorry 
 & gt customer : what about this shirt *picks up the item i just scanned* how much was it 
 & gt me : it was $ <unk> 
 & gt customer : yeah but how much with the 50 % off 
 & gt me : there 's no discount today 
 now his wife has joined him in line and asks him what we were talking about she heard something about a discount 
 & gt customer : yeah if you tell the cashier you want 50 % off they have to give it to you 
 & gt wife : to me really 
 & gt me : no there 's no sales on today sorry 
 & gt wife : oh okay 
 no problem 
 now the guy does n't take a single pause from here on out 
 & gt customer : i want 50 % off were those pants 50 % off 
 does the 50 % off just come off at the end or is it taking it off now 
 whatever the total is just take 50 % off 
 i want that picture frame for half-price too 
 i could n't even muster a smile anymore straight-faced i unhappily ring through his items 
 i tell him his total 
 & gt customer : yeah okay just take off the discount 
 what was it half off 
 & gt wife : would you stop it you 're being so embarrassing 
 & gt customer : it 's just a joke 
 he looks at me in the eyes and said 
 & gt customer : jeez you could at least smile 
 in another post i was asked about stories from my <unk> at an adult store 
 this is probably my single most favorite 
 it was a normal morning a few rental customers but otherwise not much activity yet 
 my coworker and i were rather bored as all our cleaning and organizing had been completed 
 pretty sure we were talking about the new pirates <unk> that had came in a few days prior 
 the door <unk> and in walk a couple 
 the man was not hesitant at all about walking in 
 however the woman was 
 she was partially hiding behind his back nervously glancing around like she thought a dildo was going to jump out at her 
 when she saw my coworker and i both women behind the counter she seemed to relax a bit 
 her boyfriend grabbed her hand and dragged her over to the high priced toy cabinet and started talking to her about what he wanted to get her 
 my coworker and i stopped paying much attention at that point as he obviously had been in before and knew to ask for help 
 she was nervous but it got much worse as he then started to go farther into the store 
 while the high priced toys are up front the farther you go back ... the more exotic '' the toys get 
 while you start with the <unk> almost novelty <unk> it ends in items like the american challenge and a full hand and fist 
 next to those was the <unk> toys 
 she started muttering that she really should n't be in there when they started at the vibrator wall 
 it got louder and <unk> with i 'm a good <unk> girl this is wrong 
 not the first time this has been said in the store so i do n't pay it much attention 
 what i did n't expect was when she reached the american challenge 
 it 's giant it 's purple and can be quite a shock 
 it has never however pushed someone to hysterics 
 she started panicking 
 and crying 
 and <unk> her face 
 why would someone do that 
 that is so wrong 
 they need to find jesus '' 
 then she saw the fist and cried even harder 
 she started backing up out of the section swearing at her boyfriend for bringing her in there 
 then she saw the little glass case that we knew would get us a little <unk> but it was worth it 
 this company makes <unk> molded toys 
 no <unk> but very high quality 
 the subject matter : the baby jesus a plug the <unk> mary the devil ect 
 there was even a model of the bible you could use if you were a guy to ... screw 
 she screamed pointing at the case 
 and very quickly decided to get mad 
 at us 
 you are going to hell for this 
 how dare you use them like that 
 i 'm reporting you to ... to ... someone '' 
 she ran out of the store with her boyfriend almost on the floor laughing 
 he knew exactly how she was going to react and did it anyway 
 we also started laughing after he left 
 what did she expect 
 we will never know 
 tl dr : a woman finds jesus in an adult store 
 decides not to screw herself with him 
 edit : two gold 
 damn you guys really do like dildos ... for a few years my dad and i had our own pizza place in the middle of nowhere midwest 
 working with my dad was nice enough the guy looks like tom sellick and never stops making <unk> jokes so we had fun 
 what you need to know about our town is that holy crap we had factories out the ass 
 an entire stretch of highway leading to our <unk> interstate is nothing but factories which employed almost half the town 
 we also had a lot of problems with meth 
 well not me personally 
 except this one time 
 our operation was small and simple 
 a walk-in joint where you just carry your food out 
 the kitchen was simple and <unk> so two or three people could crank out 200 hand made pizzas in a couple hours 
 and we were proud of our food by god it 's some damn <unk> pizza 
 cheese on top or your pizza 's a joke now with a town of our size we 're bound to start making some regulars and we did 
 most of our regulars are genuinely cool people like the 90-year-old guy who just peeked his head into the door pointed and we knew exactly what the cheeky old bastard wanted 
 i can call him that i counted his pennies 
 then we have these <unk> 
 local legend told us of this particular family as having moved in around the late 1800 's and immediately made the place into a shitty bog 
 the youngest <unk> of these <unk> stupid <unk> i prefer to call simply the <unk> '' 
 because it 's a <unk> combo and their son with a face like a <unk> <unk> candle 
 you fuckin read that right buddy 
 now the <unk> is a screeching <unk> of a woman who always wore jean <unk> and hair like a gray beaten <unk> sexbang wig 
 you ever play skyrim 
 she 's a <unk> 
 i shall refer to her from here on out as hag '' 
 the phone rings 
 lunch has began 
 the skalds will sing of this day 
 <unk> : a place of <unk> pizza and <unk> sauces from the generous hand of the <unk> dragon 's what can i make you '' 
 hag : yeah i want a cheese '' 
 myself : i 'm guessing that 's a cheese pizza '' 
 i know who the fuck this is 
 the caller id lights up in my face and i turn slowly to my father <unk> and teeth slowly <unk> 
 his mustache <unk> 
 so what size do you want '' 
 hag : large '' 
 me the guy writing this : okay cool can- '' hag : and i want it party cut '' 
 i do n't know what the fuck that means but i 'll make it work just pleasegodgetherhorriblescreechingvoiceoutofmyhead 
 still me brain slowly <unk> from the pressure of her mighty <unk> powers ha spoilers : okay no problem 
 <unk> '' hag : i want a pepperoni '' 
 me : okay wh- '' hag : with sausage on half '' 
 me : alright i- '' hag : and cheese on it '' 
 me : no <unk> '' hag : and sausage on the other half '' 
 me : <unk> '' hag : and a <unk> nacho cheese in the box '' 
 a second passes 
 another second 
 me : alright <unk> '' hag : and pepperoni '' 
 we wrap it up she gives me her phone number for some reason and i tell her it 'll be fifteen minutes 
 we get maybe halfway through the second pizza which was about four minutes and she 's there 
 i think she was there the whole time 
 i do n't know if she ever left 
 she fucking <unk> 'd me 
 hag : you better have that party cut '' 
 ugh 
 so we sort it out and she stands right at the window staring at us 
 unblinking 
 i think she was smelling us too 
 my dad and i continued our conversation as if she was n't there and when the time to box them up and hand them over she did n't have any money 
 she walks to the door opens it throws her head back and screams into the parking lot <unk> hah <unk> purse <unk> <unk> '' 
 it could have been english it could have been curses in the tongue of the first men of the world it could have been <unk> 's final words to <unk> but i do know that it echoed in the <unk> of the parking lot and eventually settled in the <unk> to watch over the town with hateful unblinking eyes 
 her son a man unable to speak handed her her purse and she walked back in to pay us for these cheesy monsters 
 me : with the discount comes out to <unk> '' 
 hag : i ai n't paying that '' 
 a <unk> hand of leathery flesh slaps against the counter with all the <unk> images of a butcher 's <unk> fluttering into my <unk> 
 me : it 's at least three dollars cheaper than the last time you came in 
 i 'm even giving you a topping for free '' 
 hag : it ai n't a topping 'cause the cheese is on top stupid '' 
 me : if you want to have that debate sure 
 it 'll be another four dollars '' 
 hag : i wan na talk to your manager '' 
 me : you know that i own this place with my dad here 
 you 're aware of this i 've made sure since you tried to return a <unk> old pizza last week that you ate all but the crust of '' 
 oh yeah she 's a special lady 
 hag : you better shut your mouth '' 
 me : just pay me <unk> 
 pay for your food like a real person and go home 
 that 's where you eat the food or feed the people in your basement before you eat them i guess '' 
 my dad is losing it 
 i took a <unk> of a few years after <unk> to <unk> and it seemed like he was pretty happy to have me back as he struggled not to laugh out loud 
 hag : fine but you better not sass me next time '' 
 me the guy with a <unk> tattoo on his ass : just pay and get out 
 and if you call back one more time to try and scam us out of free food i 'm putting your picture on the door and you 'll never be allowed back in '' 
 she handed me the money 
 well handed is being generous 
 she took a twenty and a five into her leathery <unk> and balled them up so she could drop them onto the counter and spat on my floor 
 yes 
 she spat on my floor 
 yes it was black 
 my dad started laughing through his mustache and we got back to work 
 then his back <unk> about two hours later 
 he looked into the air eyes searching for the sudden maleficent presence 
 the warning beacons of <unk> were lit 
 the horses became frightened 
 somewhere a dragon 's bones began to stir 
 the god damn phone rang 
 me : international <unk> of pizza and also rock 'n roll 's how ca- '' hag : you put sausage on my pizza and i did n't want no sausage you better give me a new pizza i 'm <unk> '' me : sssssshhhhhhh 
 <unk> 
 okay calm down are you listening '' 
 hag : what '' 
 me : are you listening to me 
 this is important '' 
 hag : yeah '' 
 me : nope '' 
 hag : what '' 
 me : nope 
 not doing it 
 do n't bother calling back we 're done feeding you 
 you can try chain pizza place we 've shut down three times 's because they 'll probably take your crap 
 for a while anyway '' 
 and i hung up the phone 
 for every pizza she paid for she got one for free 
 until that day 
 <unk> eagle <unk> i get the retail struggles after years of going from place to place and even dealing with dangerous stupidity in the army 
 when i finally returned to ownership with my dad holy fuck on sale it was the most <unk> experience to tell rude customers to suck it and get out.i used to work for a chain of video game stores that takes <unk> on a regular basis 
 we offered cash for games at a reduced rate but could only give cash to people over 18. i believe it had something to do with pawn laws that we had to follow 
 anyway a kid who i 'm guessing was between 15 and 17 years old comes in with his older brother one day 
 he 's got a stack of games in his hands some of them brand new and informs me that he plans on <unk> them in 
 i ask him to head over to the counter and proceed to check over the games 
 a few of them are scratched to what i would consider to be beyond repair but were still within the guidelines that allow me to accept them as trade 
 after i finish i tell him that he can go ahead and look around and i 'll have his transaction waiting for him when he 's done 
 after a couple minutes he comes up to the counter and says he wants cash for the games 
 i was familiar with this young man and was pretty sure he was n't over 18 but i asked him for his id anyway 
 as i suspected he was underage 
 & gt me : i ca n't give you cash for your games as you 're under 18 but i can give you store credit if you like 
 you can use it later when you find a game you want '' 
 he turns and looks at his brother and then agrees 
 i swipe an empty gift card through the register and he walks away with something like 15 or 20 bucks in store credit 
 he leaves with his brother and i move on with my day 
 less than an hour later he comes back in and is pretty mad 
 he 's saying his card did n't work 
 my first thought is that he went to the other store in our chain that happened to be less than 10 minutes away so i ask him 
 & gt me : did you try it at the <unk> down the street '' 
 & gt customer : no i was at <unk> '' 
 & gt me : ... '' i almost <unk> 
 the worst part was it took me about 30 minutes to explain to him why he could n't use his store credit for our store at a different store 
 tl : dr - kid did n't understand that store credit did n't mean any store 
 edit : clarification when i was 16 i worked as a salesman in an electronics retailer 
 pretty fun job i usually enjoyed interacting with the customers 
 usually 
 this was not one of those times 
 i was helping a couple that were after a new <unk> system 
 they bought the stuff left and that was that 
 entirely uneventful 
 but then it happened 
 they returned 
 the man told us his wife had lost her bag and since this was the only place they 'd been it was clearly here 
 we checked the area i 'd been talking to them and nothing there 
 then i checked the lost & amp found nothing there 
 nobody had handed anything in ... <unk> 
 after hunting around the rest of the store failed to turn up anything the manager told the customer that it did n't seem to be here but we 'd keep an eye out and contact him if it turned up 
 he thanked us and left 
 not 5 minutes later his wife stormed up to the manager and entered into a tirade about how she 'd definitely left the bag here we 'd obviously stolen it she was going to call the police etc 
 she then stormed back out of the store and my manager disappeared into the offices at the back of the store 
 a couple of hours later she 'd followed through on her threat and contacted the police 
 she came in with a <unk> and asked for the manager 
 my manager came out with a huge smile on his face 
 it turns out he 'd disappeared into the back rooms to hunt through the cctv footage and he gleefully showed the officer the footage of this woman walking out of the store with her bag 
 and another shot from the car park of her getting into her car still with the bag 
 never have i seen a man with such a look of <unk> on his face before or since 
 it was fantastic 
 we later found out that they found the bag under the seat in the car ... she never did apologise 
 it all started one afternoon when i went to a large blue tech chain with one of my friends to help him pick out a new cheap laptop 
 we walked over to the computers looked over a handful of them he asked me some questions about differences in <unk> and memory then <unk> off to go grab some games he also wanted 
 i hung around and was looking playing with the tablets they had on display when an older woman approached me : & gt **woman** : excuse me can you help me with something '' 
 & gt **me** : uh sure i guess what do you need '' 
 & gt **woman** : i need you to price match this computer with amazon '' 
 & gt **me** : oh i 'm sorry i do n't work here you 'll need to talk to one of the employees for that '' 
 & gt **woman** : what do you mean 
 you were helping that other man just a minute ago '' 
 & gt **me** : he 's one of my friends and i 'm helping him pick out a new laptop but i ca n't help you with price matching or anything like that '' & gt **woman** : well fine 
 if you do n't want to help me i 'll just find someone who does '' 
 she goes over to an actual employee and starts talking to them and i think to myself well that was weird '' and move on 
 my friend comes back over and we start trying to decide between two laptops when i suddenly hear her return 
 & gt **woman** : that 's him 
 he refused to help me '' 
 i turn around to find her standing there with a manager 
 & gt **manager** : ma'am he 's not an employee here he ca n't help you with anything '' 
 & gt **woman** : but he 's helping that man right there '' 
 pointing at my friend & gt **me** : like i said before i 'm just helping my friend here pick out a new laptop 
 i am not an employee '' 
 & gt **woman** : i just wanted to price match this 
 is that so hard to do '' 
 & gt **manager** : i understand ma'am and i can take care of that for you over at customer service '' 
 he pointed her over towards the counter and she walked away with a huff mumbling something about some people just do n't know their place '' & gt **manager** : i 'm sorry about this sir she made it sound like you were one of our employees but clearly you are just here with your friend 
 sorry about that '' 
 & gt **me** : no problem have fun with that '' 
 my friend and i promptly chose a laptop and got out of there only to find out we had also parked right next to her 
 just as i thought we had escaped she started at me again 
 & gt **woman** : how dare to you lie to your manager like that 
 you work here and i know it 
 i 've seen you here before '' 
 & gt **me** : listen lady i do n't give a shit what you think anymore 
 i do n't work here i 've never worked here 
 i 'm not wearing the blue shirt with the name tag and the big fucking logo so fuck off '' 
 i got in the car and she started yelling at me through the window spewing the usual how dare you talk to me like that '' 
 and i am your elder '' 
 crap tried to block my friend from getting into the passenger side he just got in the back on the driver side and even stood behind my car to prevent me backing up 
 as luck would have it the person who had been parked in front of me had left at some point while we were inside so i just went for the pull through 
 as we circled around towards the exit she glared at me with all her might and i just gave a big grin and a middle finger 
 **tl dr** : crazy bitch thought i was an employee and tried to get me in <unk> so once in a while i read a story here about some poor bystander getting <unk> for an employee of a store then promptly chewed out for not <unk> their <unk> <unk> 
 today was my turn 
 i work for an event oriented business that <unk> out of an old house down the street from a big chain store that specializes in hardware that is used in the home 
 given the age of the house and the size of it employees in uniform carry <unk> with them and we all wear black 
 now i dont know what <unk> this woman to approach someone dressed in only black with a radio on their hip but this lady was *pissed* 
 she storms through the aisle as i was looking for a piece of <unk> to replace something in a drink dispenser down at the house we usually got sent on errands during slow nights and starts waving a receipt in my face saying im here to return this '' 
 okay no problem she just thought i was a manager or something 
 i tell her that i dont actually work there and she pretty much <unk> it* 
 starts going on about how im avoiding dealing with her so the company can keep her money 
 at this point im a little bit rattled never been mistaken for an employee like this before so i quickly told her i would find somebody to help her out repeating that i dont actually work there 
 thats when it happened ... hey cielavocyr can i get you down to aisle <unk> real quick '' 
 <unk> one of my coworkers decided to radio me at the worst possible time as they were having trouble finding something in another aisle and wanted my help 
 the woman flips saying that i am clearly lying to her about not working there and that lying is a crime that can get me arrested ... then thank <unk> a manager walks by and sees the commotion carrying none other than a *very* similar radio on his hip 
 he explains that i dont actually work there and that she should n't be so <unk> of people 's intentions 
 my hero 
 then he deals with the return taking the receipt to check it out before walking over to returns and as i walk away i hear the faintest <unk> that the receipt was not in fact even from this store 
 retail is strange 
 you guys are heroes 
 okay so a friend of mine suggested i share this story and i think it 's probably the best i have after working in retail for 10 years 
 a few years ago i worked in a mall for a well known novelty store that also sold adult '' type merchandise 
 one day i was alone on the floor as my manager was in the backroom getting ready to leave 
 this somewhat normal looking guy walks in i greet and him he pretty much ignored me as per usual and he continued to browse 
 he eventually came up to the register put some stuff onto the counter and i smiled and began to ring up his purchase 
 i asked him if that was all he needed for today and he gave me this strange look and proceeded to point out that our store has too much profanity 
 at this time i finally realized that all of the merch he had collected had at least some form of fuck '' on it 
 thinking he was just the typical shocked old man who had never been in this store before i apologized and really did n't expect what happened next 
 crazy guy : this is against the law 
 you ca n't sell these things 
 kids can see it '' 
 me : sir there are warnings on the entrance of our store and we are allowed to sell these products or else the mall would not let us be here '' 
 cg : i 'm calling the police '' 
 yes he pulled out his cell phone and called the state troopers right there in front of me 
 now my manager had just emerged from the back and had caught some of the conversation 
 as the guy was reporting '' us to the police my manager went out into the mall and grabbed a security guard 
 meanwhile i 'm standing there completely shocked and amused wondering what this guy is going to do when the cops tell him they ca n't shut us down 
 cg : still on the phone with the cops they said i can politely ask you to stop selling these products '' 
 by now mall security arrived and escorted him out of the store 
 he the guard and my manager stood just outside the front window as the guard tried to explain to this man that he can not do anything and if he insisted to harass us he would be kicked out 
 the man begrudgingly agreed but stood on the opposite side of the hall glaring at our store for a good 10 minutes before finally leaving 
 oh it does n't end there 
 the next morning i had the opening shift and guess who showed up 
 i immediately <unk> him and decided against confronting him unless he got hostile 
 i watched him approach a bunch of tshirts grab them and promptly turn them over 
 he left soon after but i still called security just in case 
 just as the guard arrived the guy came back with the mall manager 
 i had to honestly hold back my laughter as this guy pleaded his case to the mall manager 
 props to the mall manager who listened patiently and then told the guy the same thing along with if you do not like the products they sell then do not come in here '' 
 after that i never saw him <unk> on phone long time retail slave 
 some background 
 my father is a cpa who runs a small shop in the front of the office for extra income 
 he has no employees for the shop other then my sister and me when we were younger 
 so i was my birthday and my dad was <unk> to take me to lunch 
 as we were getting ready to head out a tax client came by and needed his taxes done now '' 
 i know this wo n't take more then a hour so i say no problem i will just run the shop to stay out of the way and we will get lunch after he is done 
 now the fun part i am in the front reading a book when in walks a customer 
 i put the book down and ask if i can help with anything 
 lady brushes me off so i go back to my novel 
 when she is done she comes to the front and i start ringing her purchases 
 she also wants two money orders for $ 500 each so i ring them in and give her her total 
 she pulls out a checkbook and asks for a pen i inform her that money orders are cash only and give her the pen and her total for her items minus the money orders and the fees associated with them 
 she looks at me like she just realized i was the shit she stepped in on the way to work and says your new here but the owner lets me write checks for money orders and gives me a 15 % discount on all purchases '' 
 i say that 's fine she is more then welcome to come back when the owner is working 
 she instantly loses her shit and starts berating me my looks and anything she thinks i might like 
 i just sat there thinking no good deed 
 when she realized i was n't <unk> she started throwing the packets of gum next to to register at me 
 so my dad hears the commotion and sticks his head out the door that connects the back offices to the front and sees this women throwing gum at me while i am dodging them laughing and telling her to calm down 
 now when i said my dad is a cpa you probably <unk> a small balding man wearing a bad suit change that image to a large hairy biker that loves math now you have a better idea of what he looks like 
 he quite calmly asks my name is there a problem 
 hearing the owner this woman turns mid throw and says the only problem here is that this bitch you hired wo n't do her job '' 
 that is when i got the best present a retail worker could ask for my dad responds that bitch is my daughter and it 's her birthday 
 get the f**k out of my store and if i ever see you again here or even out on the street i am going to show you exactly how mad i am right now run '' 
 and she did she dropped every thing is her hands and hightailed it out of the store 
 my dad canceled the rest of his appointment which the client readily agreed to and we went for a wonderful lunch 
 when the fourth book of the harry potter series came out there was a printer 's error in some of the us <unk> 
 a couple text blocks were identical so parts of some chapters were repeated 
 we had some very angry people coming in for exchanges but we were ready 
 we just swapped 'em out and were as cheerful as possible 
 ho ho 
 the printer must have been drunk on butter beer 
 such <unk> we were 
 one lady came in furious though because her entire book was printed upside down 
 she angrily slid the book over for me to examine the poor quality standards in american <unk> 
 i looked at the book took the dust jacket off turned the book around put the dust jacket back on and said <unk> <unk> '' 
 she looked at me with such rage and then <unk> broke 
 she realized what she had done and started laughing 
 which is good because my boss at the time was not as nice as <unk> <unk> 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven 
 two years ago a woman stopped in to get some stuff to give to her kids as christmas presents 
 she had two boys 8 & amp 15 and wanted me to help her pick out some stuff 
 i showed her some of the smaller things but she actually ended up buying a big mortar kit for the kids figuring that she could help them light them off and it would be more impressive 
 a few days after christmas she came back and told me this story 
 it was just her and the kids and they had had a great christmas 
 she thought her younger son would be excited by the fireworks so <unk> let him open it but after he had ripped off the wrapping paper and seen what it was he didn’t really say anything about it 
 she was sitting across the room from him and asked him what the present was that santa had gotten him 
 he mumbled something and set the box aside 
 she was a little disappointed that he wasn’t more excited but she didn’t say anything and they continued ripping open gifts 
 later that morning after the gift hurricane had died down she decided to ask him about the fireworks and went to grab the box 
 she couldn’t find it in the pile of presents and she didn’t see it in his room 
 it’s a good sized box about 3 ft tall and 18 inches wide so it <unk> have been hard to spot 
 she asks her son about the big box that santa had gotten him and he just shrugged his shoulders 
 it turns out he had hidden the box under his bed 
 when he 'd opened the present he had quickly reasoned that if his mom found out that santa had given him a big box of fireworks she would take them away 
 he had played it cool and hidden the box when she wasn’t looking 
 truly a child after my own <unk> a lady walked in my bakery and bought some cookies 
 their price was something like 6.30 euros but she only had 6 euros on her 
 since i 'm the owner i told her that it 's ok 6 is enough 
 so i gave her a receipt for 6 euros cash register and she left 
 five minutes later she was back to complain 
 the receipt says 6 euros '' she said 
 yes that 's right '' i said 
 but you said it was 6.30 '' i was so confused 
 yes '' i said and you did n't carry enough cash so i told you it was ok to pay me only 6 '' 
 but the receipt says that the price was only 6 
 you asked for <unk> why did you ask me for 6.30 in the first place '' 
 because i type the price of the product and then it 's printed on the receipt '' 
 it took her a minute 
 oh '' 
 ... ... '' ok then bye '' 
 so much for trying to be nice 
 so back in 2011 i was working at a gas station doing the graveyard shift 
 i had a lot of regulars who would come in between 4 and 6 and most would say hi or try to make conversation 
 one guy rg never said anything the most i ever got outta him were grunts he was middle aged and worked in an auto shop from what i could tell 
 he also would never look at me 
 then one morning i had worn my roommates shoes over mine to work because i could n't afford boots and my shoes had holes in them <unk> with <unk> ft of snow on the ground and a different regular asks about the men 's shoes sitting behind the register 
 i explain and that guy laughs a bit then leaves 
 rg comes up with his coffee and i ring him up and go to hand him his receipt when he says & gt '' write your shoe size down '' 
 i was <unk> i had been ringing him up every day for a year and he never said anything to me 
 i was pretty sure he hated me 
 i told him it was n't necessary 
 he practically yelled at me to write my shoe size down after that so i did 
 the next day he brought me a pair of really nice boots i offered to pay him back but he refused 
 instead i rang up his coffee as an employee coffee free for the next year and a half 
 he never said anything to me after that either 
 edit : forgot to mention it was the middle of winter edit 2 : this hit the front page 
 thanks guys 
 me at my register 
 customer paying for his phone card 
 customer : i 'd like to pay with two different credit cards 
 put $ 20 on the first one and the remainder on the rest 
 me : absolutely 
 i hit the partial card payment button on my screen entered 2000 and hit enter 
 as the customer swiped his first card it was declined 
 i showed him the little <unk> receipt that prints out and informed him of that fact 
 customer : yeah because i want to pay $ 20 on this first card 
 you ca n't charge me for the whole thing 
 i just want $ 20 on the first card

 the customer sighs heavily and gets on his phone for about half a minute

 i clear my screen and do as he says 
 lo and behold he 's left with a new total

 & gt m- i 'm sorry sir can you explain the issue to me 
 & gt c- she wo n't ring up the meal 
 & gt m- we ca n't ring it up as a meal without a drink sir 
 besides <unk> 's cheaper than the meal to order the two items on their own 
 ** the customer starts making angry noises that may have been words 
 over the headset so that c ca n't hear it my boss says & gt m- dude what is he arguing 
 i ca n't figure out what he wants 
 & gt msb- i have no idea 
 & gt m- what kind of soda do you want 
 back to speaking with the customer the manager rings up the meal and enters in the drink but <unk> the price of the drink which was $ 0 anyway because of the way our system worked 
 & gt c- i said i did n't want the drink 
 & gt m- do n't worry you 're not being charged for it and it will not be given to you 
 it just has to be rung in this way 
 & gt c- finally god no wonder you morons work here 
 yes we 're the morons 
 you 're definitely not 
 you 're the smart guy who just paid more than he had to despite our best attempts to help you and bought me a soda 
 edit : some people in the comments seemed to think that it was cheaper to order the meal than the burger and fries separately 
 i <unk> a sentence to show otherwise 
 i work as a cashier in the lumber department of a home improvement store 
 today a lady and her son who was probably about three years old came in to get some various pieces of lumber 
 as they were ringing out i noticed a light brown praying mantis just hanging out on one of the pieces of wood 
 i jokingly said to the mom is that praying mantis yours '' 
 she laughed and said it 's been sitting there since they came in 
 the little boy seemed very interested in it bending down just to observe it 
 when i was finished ringing everything up and the mom was about to slide her card the boy yelled wait 
 i want to get something '' 
 probably thinking he wanted a candy bar or something his mom waited to pay 
 instead of picking out some candy or a drink like most kids do the boy gently picked up the praying mantis and brought it to my counter 
 he placed it down ever so carefully and asked me can i please buy this 
 he 's really cool '' 
 i looked at his mom and she nodded 
 so i turned to the little boy and said you can take him home and i wo n't even make you pay for him because i can tell he likes you '' 
 the kid 's face lit up and he just kept thanking me 
 the whole interaction brightened my day a little because not only was the boy very polite but it also reminded me of the wonder and excitement of being a little kid and finding a cool new <unk> worked at a high fashion retail store that had a <unk> flow of older uppity southern women 
 i have always referred to my clients '' in 4 ways : sir gentleman young lady and miss 
 i have been in high end customer service long enough to know that terms like young lady '' and miss '' is found charming especially to our older cliental that has n't been called a young lady in 4 decades 
 our checkout counters are a little higher so i have to reach up a bit when i give them a pen and the receipt to sign 
 now this lady was about 60 years old and as southern uppity as they come 
 i hand her the receipt and pen simultaneously & gt '' if you would sign on the bottom line miss : '' she slaps me 
 like a nun slaps a kids hand with a <unk> 
 i stand there completely stunned ... did this woman just slap me 
 she sternly says & gt '' i am not a miss i am a ma'am '' 
 the only words i can think to whisper are & gt ummmm ... 
 sorry '' 
 i now have to wrap up her items and bring them around the checkout counter to her 
 i thank you so much ma'am 
 have a wonderful day ma'am '' 
 so thankful to be done with that mess and getting over just being slapped in my own store i see my manager approaching her 
 the evil old woman eow stopped to look at a few things before she left 
 my manager said & gt excuse me but i 've had several customers and associates tell me that you hit my associate '' 
 & gt eow : hit 
 no i slapped her 
 she <unk> me and had to be put in her place 
 & gt manager : so you did hit her 
 & gt eow : yes 
 i have a title and it 's not miss 
 i should n't have to teach manners 
 & gt manager : miss i will not tolerate verbal abuse and i <unk> will not tolerate physical abuse of my staff 
 we have your information on file along with a security tape if she decides to press charges 
 i have to ask you to leave the store at once and your business is no longer welcomed here 
 & gt eow : this is ridiculous 
 i 'm never coming in here again 
 & gt manager : that 's the point of banning you 
 have a great day miss 
 never saw that crazy uppity b again : happy new year guys 
 this story is a little difficult for me to tell in english so please excuse any possible mistakes 
 in my bakery we sell a wide variety of chocolate confections that you can gift in <unk> boxes 
 yesterday a woman around <unk> walked in and asked for a box of chocolate confections to give as a gift 
 she will be known as worst customer of the year wcy 
 she was getting grumpier and grumpier while i was trying not to <unk> her without success 
 this is what happened : wcy : i would like to buy exactly 750 grams of chocolate 
 me : sure is this box ok 
 wcy : how much does it take 
 remember i don’t want it to exceed 750 grams 
 me : it takes up to <unk> grams 
 wcy : there is no way this box takes more than half a kilo 
 show me a bigger one 
 me : oh no it does take 750 grams easily 
 i also use it for <unk> grams 
 wcy : there is no way 
 come on show me a bigger box 
 me : ok this one takes a kilo or a little more 
 wcy : yes let’s use this one 
 i’ve used it before 
 but i don’t want a full kilo 
 i want exactly 750 grams 
 me : i will try to select the lightest pieces so it gets full and stays under 800 grams 
 wcy : yes you do that 
 because the other day i used this one and it took a little more than a kilo 
 this time i want exactly 750 grams 
 me : ok i’m trying to put lighter pieces inside 
 as i was working wcy : hey why didn’t you put some of these too 
 me : these have whole <unk> inside they are very heavy 
 wcy : i want some of those too come on these are the best ones 
 me : ok but it won’t be exactly 750 grams 
 wcy : yeah yeah i told you it wouldn’t be 
 come on put some of those too 
 me : but ma’am those are full of <unk> they are also really heavy 
 wcy : i already told you i want those 
 me : ok fine but you also told me that you don’t want it to exceed the desired <unk> wcy : yeah i’ve been here before you always put more than i ask for 
 me : but i just told you i’m trying to put the lightest ones and you <unk> asking me for the <unk> ones 
 plus you didn’t let me use the smaller box 
 wcy : oh my god i already told you the other box doesn’t take more than 500 grams 
 me : but <unk> wcy : and the lightest pieces are not the best ones 
 me : ok ok i can only leave the box <unk> then if you want exactly 750 grams 
 wcy : girl i can’t possibly offer an empty box 
 fill it up 
 me : ok. after i’m done me : it’s 1 kilo and 85 grams 
 wcy : see 
 i told you <unk> be more than 750 grams 
 you always do that 
 at least she bought it 
 so i work at the deli in the grocery store down the road from me i have for about 2 years now 
 i 'm a 20 year old proud father and usually enjoy my work to support my son and girlfriend 
 the work is ok and i love my coworkers 
 we get a lot of regulars people that you see coming and can start their orders before they approach the counter 
 i remember sometime last year an older man would come in every day and get ham turkey and yellow american 
 every day 
 he was a pleasant old man and had great stories he would tell while i was waiting on him 
 i showed him pictures of my family and we had genuine conversations 
 last november he came in one day and he looked so down and scared 
 i asked him what was wrong and received no response not even eye contact 
 i did his order and he left without a word 
 i knew something was wrong and although i did n't even know this man 's name i was worried 
 fast forward about a week of him not coming in and i know something is up 
 so finally he comes in like nothing ever happened 
 i asked of everything was ok and he said just some minor pains 
 i started his order and he said actually can we do low sodium ham turkey and yellow from now on '' 
 not thinking anything of it i just smiled and said sure 
 this would become his regular 
 he began coming in less and less almost sporadically 
 i remember early october he said he had some news for me and he was sorry for being a downer 
 i told him not to sweat it and i understand 
 he looked at me eyes glossy and said they found a <unk> '' 
 my heart fucking broke 
 he left without giving me a chance to reply but on his way out he turned to me and said you 're a good kid '' 
 and i never saw him <unk> was helping a customer when i saw a lady checking our chocolate display case 
 i have never seen her before 
 she never said hi or goodbye 
 she just opened the window grabbed a piece of <unk> chocolate ate it and left the store 
 now i always let customers try anything the store is mine even expensive chocolate like this 
 but i do n't like it when they just help themselves without asking especially when they open the cases and grab stuff with bare hands i use gloves 
 i wanted to say something but she left before i did 
 i 'm glad i did n't 
 because later that day she came back and bought <unk> euros worth of chocolate for the <unk> 's office 
 i worked in a drug store chain for many years 
 one thing we sold was watch batteries 
 because many watches are very expensive we were not authorized to change the battery 
 one customer got very upset saying that you sell watch batteries you have to change it '' 
 well my wonderful manager says we sell <unk> but we do n't give those either '' 
 loved that guy 
 <unk> had no idea my original post about my dad would blow up like it did 
 in hindsight after all of my years in retail and all of the stories i have read on tfr i realize that he was the hero we all wanted haha 
 so here is the story of when he chased a customer out to his car 
 original post is <unk> so to start a little more history about my dad 
 he was a gay man who raised me on his own 
 he moved us around the country while he bought failing pet stores and quickly made them <unk> to resell and move on to the next one 
 he was crazy and did n't care what anyone thought 
 he always said the customer is always right is bullshit the truth is the customer is always the customer and there are more where they came from '' 
 he was a legend in the industry 
 he was also an award winning dog <unk> and <unk> for show dogs to several <unk> 
 that brings stories of it 's own 
 he seriously gave zero fucks 
 i will likely make a post soon just detailing the <unk> of my crazy retail genius dad 
 but for now ... the customer he chased to his car 
 so a surprisingly large amount of profit from our pet store came from the sale of live feeders 
 <unk> 1000 per week crickets <unk> per week and goldfish <unk> per week 
 this story involves feeder goldfish used to feed larger fish and small aquatic snakes and other reptiles 
 it should be noted that when our shipments of these feeder '' animals arrived we would typically sell out within a few days and would have to wait until next week 's shipment 
 as an exotic pet store this was big business 
 we had this one guy who came in every single week to buy $ 1.00 worth of feeder goldfish 
 we sold them at 10 for $ 1.00 
 this guy was a complete asshole 
 every week he treated our employees like garbage and like his slaves 
 he complained about everything 
 how they were collected 
 how they were bagged 
 that the way they were poured into the bag would <unk> them '' 
 drove a very expensive car and just thought we could n't possibly survive without him 
 finally one week dad had enough 
 he happened to be the one to help this customer after <unk> times of seeing his behavior 
 the guy threw out his usual attitude and complaints and pressed my dad 's buttons 
 as my dad 's only child i can <unk> to the fact that you do not want to press his buttons 
 my dad let 's loose on this asshole 
 he says who the f do you think you are 
 you come in here every week acting like a douche for $ 1.00 worth of feeders 
 well let me tell you something 
 i sell those 10 for $ 1.00 
 those 10 cost me 60 cents 
 the bag costs me another 10 cents 
 that 's 70 cents not including the labor to serve your <unk> ass every week 
 how much shit do you expect me and my employees to take for your 30 cents a week 
 do you think you keep me in business 
 i will be out of these fish tomorrow 
 someone else will buy them so fuck off '' 
 i do n't remember exactly what the guy said back but it was shitty and whatever it was set my dad off 
 guy said he would never shop here again and it was cut rate and blah blah i think 
 my dad starts going off on this guy to the point where he looks afraid 
 he says fuck this '' and leaves 
 my dad follows him out to his car telling him off the whole time 
 by this point the guy realizes my dad is insane the rest of us already knew this and were in hysterics 
 he tries getting in his car 
 my crazy dad blocks the door of his car until he finished saying what he had to say 
 finally he is done and he and the guy just look at each other for a minute 
 the guy says i 'm really sorry '' 
 dad says you should be asshole '' 
 by this time we were in tears watching this unfold 
 the next week the guy shows up and is the nicest person ever 
 he continued to buy his feeders from us for several years without incident 
 next up ... dad 's business meetings '' i very rarely get complaints on me and it has been more than two years since someone was so <unk> with my help that they actually called corporate on me but that all changed last week 
 i had been going around the dog food section of the store facing the cans and smaller bags when an older man maybe in his 60 's walked up and asked if he could get someone to help him get a <unk> bag of dog food up to the front 
 he did not have a cart with him so i told him that i would be happy to help 
 i grabbed his chosen bag and walked up to the front with him 
 nothing really seemed <unk> 
 i made small talk asked about what kind of dog he had chatted about the weather because anything below 70 in florida is worth talking about 
 i helped him out to his car thanked him for his <unk> to our store and went about my day 
 all seemed well 
 yesterday however i get called into the office where my gm is waiting to speak to me 
 she tells me we have a huge complaint on me and that it has gone up to our dm and that i am to receive a write-up as per his orders 
 apparently i was expected to have gone and gotten one of our male associates to help this guy 
 i insulted and humiliated '' this customer by grabbing the bag myself 
 he said in his complaint that it was totally unacceptable for a little girl '' to lift those bags and that i was obviously trying to make him look like a weak old man in front of other customers 
 i am so mad about this because i got the write up which i refused to sign because all i was doing was my job and had to have a counseling session '' with out gm and asm about how to properly respect out customers 
 when i was hired i had to prove that i could lift and carry <unk> if i wanted to work on the floor for this exact reason 
 floor associates have to be able to help customers with bags and boxes that they would not be able to lift themselves 
 i was never once rude to this man never once mentioned anything about how he needed help with the bag 
 i did my <unk> to provide the best customer service to him and followed the store 's stupid ass <unk> '' model of customer service 
 i did everything right and i am still getting in trouble over it 
 and my gm and asm never once said that it was a shit complaint 
 they just kept going over and over how i need to be more aware of customer <unk> and how it really is reasonable that an older man would not want lifting help from a 5 foot tall little girl '' 
 so sorry sir that i did my damned job and even helped you out to your car 
 <unk> i am so mad 
 sorry for the rant guys but i figured you lovely retail folks would understand the need to vent this 
 edit : i have now made a call to my hr department and am waiting to hear back from them 
 the moment the phrase gender discrimination '' and sexism '' came into the conversation i was transferred to a supervisor '' 
 they seemed very sympathetic and more than a little bit worried about legal trouble over this 
 i have gotten a copy of the write up that i now have at home 
 i 'll get back as soon as i have any more information about the situation 
 <unk> : i also have faxed a copy of my write up to hr so they have a copy of it as well 
 <unk> : because i was just reminded here is a link to the <unk> of this epic journey of <unk> i got a new job doing customer service at one of the biggest electronic companies in the us 
 a little background on myself i 'm currently in college working on my ba in art design & amp visual <unk> which is a fancy way to say <unk> design 
 so part of customer service also means ringing at the front lanes every once in awhile 
 a man comes up to me and shows me two pieces of paper my companies online price for a 64gb flash drive and a competitors online companies price for the same product 
 my company is big on price matching so of course i have to check it out 
 here 's the thing my company 's regular price for this product was $ <unk> and the competitor company 's regular price was $ 39.99 
 i was <unk> and it was one of my first days alone at the register so i read the descriptions thoroughly 
 they were exactly the same 
 examined the product pictures exactly the same 
 even examined the model numbers exactly the same 
 but then i realized something very subtle the title and description font used on my companies website was the exact same 
 same size same color same spacing not one word out of place 
 after taking three <unk> based classes i could catch these little details from a mile away 
 i immediate realized this guy photoshopped the title description model number etc ... over a cheaper flash drive from the competitor company 
 i tell a little white lie to the customer to see if he 'll <unk> : & gt **me : ** sir we actually are n't allowed to price match according to print outs 
 i 'd need to see the website in live view just to make sure the sale has n't run out 
 if you have your phone on you we could check it out on there 
 & gt & gt **customer : ** i do n't have my phone with me ... ca n't you just adjust it 
 it 's the exact same model number and everything 
 & gt & gt **me : ** i can not but i 'd be happy to look it up on my phone for you if you do n't have yours 
 he was visually getting nervous through out the conversation and as soon as i pulled my phone out he bolted 
 i continued to check after he left and of course i was right 
 and they say art degrees are useless.it was a typical shift 
 still handing out the coupons where you get $ 5 off if you spend $ 50 and get $ 15 off if you spend $ 100 
 it was the last day of the coupons so we were telling everyone and <unk> they grab a chocolate bar to take them over the line 
 all of them were extremely grateful and some we spotted a couple more times grabbing things for the freezer stocking up on <unk> food 
 i get to a lady gl and she has a gluten-free recipe book 
 i very vaguely <unk> through since a loved one has just been diagnosed with a gluten allergy and was struggling with adjusting 
 we talked about the book for a little bit as i scan the rest of her items and then we get to her total just shy of $ 100 
 so i tell her about the coupon deal and she goes to grab a couple more things to take her over 
 she brings the last of the gluten-free recipe books over gets $ 15 off pays for everything and then gives the second recipe book to me 
 gl : here cook some nice things for her for me 
 it 's pretty much free with this coupon so take it home for me 
 i 'm floored at this point 
 here i was thinking she 'd be giving it to a <unk> or something 
 i 've had nice customers i 've been <unk> before seeing a once-pregnant regular with a newborn or hearing about them falling on hard times but this time i <unk> cried 
 no customer had ever done that for me before 
 i never expected it 
 i thanked her profusely and kept making sure if it was alright which she said it was 
 my manager was watching and he pulled me aside explaining that i was n't meant to receive gifts from customers 
 i went to give the book to him but he told me he 'd turn a blind eye just this once 
 i put it in my locker and took it home after my shift 
 she did n't have to do that it was so nice of her 
 tl dr : happy tears customer gave me something out of the kindness of her heart 
 so i 'm back home on break from college and return to work at my grocery store in a few days just in time for the <unk> rush 
 yesterday i was doing some last minute christmas shopping at a large <unk> pushing a cart of items while wearing my winter coat and jeans 
 what i was wearing is important because a rather large woman on an electric scooter <unk> came up to me and demanded to know where the peanut butter and paper towels were 
 we were in the electronic section so she was impressively far off 
 i politely said that i do n't work here but they 're probably in the grocery department across the store 
 she ignored the first part of my statement and demanded i go get them for her because that 's too far 
 i repeated that i do n't work here and turned so she could see that i was wearing a jacket and jeans instead of a polo of a certain color that this store 's employees wear and <unk> 
 this is where it went from crazy to insane 
 she said that she knew i worked there and claimed i took my name tag off when i saw her coming 
 she called me lazy and stupid and said if i did n't want to work here then i should n't have dropped out of school 
 she then demanded again that i go get her peanut butter and paper towels 
 at this point i saw my opportunity to finally tell a customer off 
 it was as another customer but hey that 's still something 
 and as i do n't get to do this at work i went a bit <unk> ... i told her that she was an entitled <unk> who clearly did n't need any more food but if she really desired it then she should get up off her fat ass and walk across the damn store like everyone else 
 i also told her that i am in school and reiterated that i do n't work at this store 
 or for this chain 
 or in this town 
 i also pointed out the large signs hanging as you come in that point you to different sections of the store 
 electronics and grocery were in opposite directions so clearly she was the stupid one 
 i then continued on not worried about seeing her again as those scooters are really really slow when you put a huge person on them 
 it might be a bit petty and an <unk> but it was my big chance to snap back i used to work years ago in a retail store now <unk> i work in it and have limited customer interaction 
 the store i worked in was a hobby shop mostly cheap-ish stuff though we also sold some high-end soft guns some <unk> up to $ <unk> <unk> all of us in the store the store manager full time employees and part timers had a really great bond - only the higher up managers made the work kinda <unk> but that is another tale indeed and thankfully they did n't show themselves too often 
 any way 
 one day when i was working the register a father and his son entered the store and started looking at one of the more expensive soft guns 
 we usually had a lot of lookie <unk> so after checking if they needed assistance i went back to my business - i do n't mind kids wanting to look at the cool guns it 's actually nice hearing how excited they sometimes get 
 after a bit of looking the father f cleared his throat and pointed at the gun 
 f : we would like that one '' 
 me : sure thing 
 i 'll just get my coworker to get it out of stock - hey coworker cw would you mind going to the back to get this gun for the customer '' 
 me to the father and child again : it really is a nice soft gun you 've chosen '' 
 i then describe all the advantages of the gun to them 
 me : i 'll just ring you out while we wait for coworker to get back 
 it will be $ <unk> - please '' 
 f : oh we have an agreement with the manager that we could get this for half price '' me : i 'm sorry but i highly doubt that since that would make us loose money on the sale '' though this is a bit of an exaggeration it would be close enough that it just would n't be <unk> 
 f starting to get angry : now listen 
 i called and spoke with the manager who assured me that i could get this for half price '' 
 me : i 'm sorry but i would know if you had and i 'm not aware of such an agreement '' 
 at this time my coworker comes back with the gun and having overheard the last bit of conversation i see in his eyes he thinks he knows full well how this will end 
 f angry now : what 's your name 
 i 'll tell the manager about this - he and i are very good friends '' 
 me : my names mbrondum 
 coworker could you get the manager for us '' 
 i could see this surprised my coworker at bit but he quickly caught on and nooded 
 cw : sure thing ... '' he started walking to the back then turned around hey mbrondum 
 could you go to the register 
 a customers wants to speak with the manager ... '' me : of course '' 
 turning to the father again i 'm sorry i forgot to tell you : i 'm the manager of this store and i have in no way spoken with you about getting anything half off ... and i do not believe i know you so the 'good <unk> you mentioned is n't true either '' 
 never have i seen an angry man <unk> so fast being caught in a lie that red handed 
 they ended up not buying the soft gun but cw and i did get a good laugh out of it 
 edit : to <unk> soft guns is a local <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> happened to me when shopping around at the more low brow '' pawn shop in town 
 i was there on my lunch break and was wearing a polo shirt and dress pants shopping for <unk> and amps 
 angry lady at the pawn shop : hey you boy ... get over here and help me get this tv off the shelf i want to buy it 
 me : looks around not seeing anybody else in the area um are you talking to me 
 al : who the hell else would i be talking to do you see anybody else here 
 are you going to get this tv for me or not 
 me : haha nope 
 that 's not happening 
 al : i'mma gon na get you fired you ca n't talk to a customer like that 
 me : go right the fuck ahead 
 al : what is your name me : go fuck yourself al : what did you just say to me 
 me : here i 'll spell it out for you ... slowly g ... o ... f ... u ... c ... k ... y ... o ... u ... <unk> ... s ... e ... l ... f al yelling : did you just hear what he told me to do 
 manager 
 manager 
 i want this punk fired 
 me : um yeah ... i do n't work here 
 do you see a name tag or a uniform 
 al : you still need to be fired me : and you still need to go fuck yourself 
 she goes up to the front counter and starts screaming at the poor kid at the terminal saying how terrible i 'm treating her and how i have a terrible attitude 
 i just smile as i cheerily waved goodbye and left the store 
 this is why i need to stop going shopping when i am dressed for work <unk> ... although i do have to say it is nice to be able to be rude back to rude people after years of having to take it in retail 
 i usually chuckle and tell people that i do n't work there this happens to me on occasion and they usually apologize but this lady was so entitled and had such a demanding tone i could n't help but be cheerfully obscene with her.i work at an electronics retail store 
 we have a different section specifically for returning and refunding items 
 upon receiving the item we must always as for the reason of return and we must open the item *even if factory sealed 
 * i am v my manager is m and the customer is c. & gt v : hi & gt c : hi i 'd like to return this drone 
 our policy for drones is that they were non-refundable but this policy was changed as long as all products are in working condition it can be accepted for return 
 & gt v : okay just a second sir 
 i open the box 
 the manual the remote the batteries and the package <unk> is there 
 everything that is there is supposed to be there <unk> the drone itself is n't there 
 it 's basically the entire package without the drone 
 & gt v : what 's the reason for returning this item 
 & gt c : oh the drone flew away and it never came back 
 can i get a refund for this 
 manager walks over i 'm still new to doing returns 
 i recently got out of training as a cashier which means my manager is very <unk> whenever i am doing returns because he has to authorize it and make sure i 'm doing it right 
 & gt v : um ... & gt m : what 's wrong 
 & gt c : oh hi so my drone flew away and it never came back 
 can i get a refund 
 & gt m : fuck no what 's wrong with you 
 get out of my store 
 customer walks 
 i do n't think he 's even angry because there were no signs showing it 
 i died laughing because it was the first time i saw the manager swear to a customer 
 sometimes i love retail : i 'm the general manager at a sporting goods retailer 
 as all of you know employees make mistakes 
 the majority of us will admit to it and apologize and if a customer is nice about it we 'll work with them 
 if they 're rude <unk> so much 
 this is about a customer who was n't so nice 
 i 'm at my gun counter talking to one of our regulars about a new gun i had just put on the shelf when one of my sales associates comes up and gives me <unk> look* 
 managers know this look it tells us something is wrong 
 i ask my regular to sit tight and go over to my associate sa and ask her what 's wrong 
 sa explains that there 's a very grumpy customer in our shoe department who wants a $ 110 pair of shoes for $ 30 
 wat 
 these shoes go on sale for $ 70 the hell happened 
 sa explains that there was a generic sales tag on the box for $ 30 and it was her fault because she tagged them by mistake 
 ok it could be worse let 's go say hi to ms grumpy pants gp 
 me : hi ma'am 
 what ca- gp : these shoes are $ 30 right 
 me : actually no 
 they 're $ 70 bu- gp : the sale tag says $ 30 
 i want these shoes for $ 30 
 your sales associate gave me this box herself 
 this bitch 
 she could 've let me finish and been cool about the situation but she decides to cut me off and make rude demands 
 ok let 's give her one more chance 
 me : i understand ma'am but the- gp : i do n't care 
 the sales tag says $ 30 
 you have to sell it to me for that price because it 's the law 
 it 's her fault 
 *points at sa* strike 3 shit stain 
 time to drop the hammer 
 i put myself between sa and gp so she can focus her hate on me 
 me : no 
 gp : what do you mean no 
 this <unk> me : first of all there 's no law in our state or at the federal level that says i have to sell you a product just because a price tag shows a certain price 
 it 's an advertisement nothing more 
 gp : bu- me : second i do n't have to sell you anything if i do n't want to 
 i reserve the right to refuse service to anyone 
 you were rude to sa and to me and i 'm sick of your attitude 
 gp : this is outrageous 
 i demand to speak to your manager 
 oh 
 yes 
 here it comes 
 me : well guess what lady 
 i am the manager 
 she stares open mouthed while i show her my name badge 
 me : since you decided to be rude to me and sa instead of being nice and understanding not only will you not get these shoes for $ 30 you 're not getting them at all 
 now get out of my store 
 gp : i 'll complain to your corporate office about this 
 i 'm never shopping here again 
 me : you do that and do n't worry your money wo n't be missed 
 now get out 
 she <unk> out of the store and sa has been loving her job ever since that day 
 do n't fuck with my employees 
 edit : <unk> : ** i work as an assistant manager at a large chicken fast-food chain while putting my way through med school 
 i can only work part-time due to my studies but the company was great about letting me keep my job since i 've been with them since high school 
 **the story : ** all throughout college i was the manager in charge of hiring 
 all the managers interviewed but i made the decision on who got hired 
 and we got some real human beans that decided to apply 
 there was one kid who decided to come up to the interview wearing a t-shirt and <unk> pants 
 okay so what he 's sixteen 
 he seemed really nervous so i decided to put him at ease 
 all right buddy so your name is john smith '' 
 yup '' 
 and you live at <unk> <unk> drive '' 
 er ... i think so 
 my dad filled out the application so i 'm not too sure '' 
 he did n't get the job 
 another qualified candidate '' was recommended to me as a good dude '' by one of our <unk> 
 another sixteen year old kid 
 he had a decent interview but seemed rather <unk> awkward so i decided to mull it over a bit before hiring him 
 our candidate had other plans though 
 he called the store to follow up the very next day 
 i happened to be there so they put me on 
 i told him i liked the <unk> and that i would let him know on the decision in a few days 
 he did n't get that 
 at all 
 he called the store again 
 and again 
 it must have been four times a day for the next three days 
 he managed to get a few different managers we have five so it was finally on the seventeenth call when i was at work again 
 i answered the phone and he told me who he was and why he was calling ... and look whoever is in charge of hiring really needs to get their act together '' 
 i told him i 'm in charge of hiring '' 
 ... <unk> '' i do n't want you to call the store again 
 you wo n't get this job but wherever else you apply while it 's great to <unk> do n't call more than once a week okay '' 
 he did n't get the job 
 girl came in for an interview very pretty 
 probably <unk> 
 i immediately smelled the weed on her 
 her eyes were bloodshot too 
 i shook her hand introduced myself and sat down at the table with her outside thank you very much 
 i asked her if she was high 
 she giggled a bit and said no while <unk> at me 
 i asked two more questions and told her that 's all there was 
 she did n't get the job 
 finally a happy story 
 a big black dude came in and asked for an application 
 he said he wanted to meet the manager as he turned it in 
 he shook my hand and told me that he had disclosed a felony for drug <unk> on the application 
 he had been convicted a year ago and had spent some jail time and was now trying to find clean work 
 he 'd told me that he had a lot of trouble getting a job because of the felony but that he would be the best worker i ever hired if i just gave him a chance 
 i interviewed him and decided to hire him despite the record 
 best cook i ever had incredibly hard worker and the nicest guy ever 
 he ended up using the experience and our glowing <unk> to get a job as a <unk> cook at a family mexican restaurant with plans to work up to a <unk> chef 
 so glad i gave him a <unk> in my old video game job where we were crazy about games we used to have a policy that customers could try out any game in the store 
 it really helped cut down on returns 
 this meant however that we would get a few customers who would abuse this policy 
 enter draconian 
 i do n't know his real name i just know that every character he made on any game and the xbox <unk> he set up on our demo unit was named draconian 
 he was a late <unk> 20s man child 
 about 6'5 '' and overweight 
 he would come in almost daily and spend hours playing games rarely purchasing anything 
 when this happened the elder <unk> : oblivion had come out 
 draconian was coming in daily and spent literally hours standing in one spot and playing the game 
 i would inform him every half hour or so that he needed to take a break and could just play games all day 
 he would save walk away for a minute and jump right back to it when i started working on something else 
 after a few days of this i was tired of him 
 the next time he came in he played oblivion for a solid 5 hours 
 i did n't bother him once 
 when he finally took his leave of the game and i was sure he was gone i loaded up his game and dumped almost a week 's worth of progress in one part of the map 
 warped him across the map to the woods and left his character naked and alone 
 deleted every save file except this one and shut the game off 
 the next time draconian came in he asked to play oblivion 
 i gladly obliged put the game in and walked away 
 i can still remember him sputtering and frantically trying to search for a way to get his progress back 
 he was nearly in tears as he left minutes after 
 tl dr customer abuses store policy so i leave him naked in the <unk> summer when i was home from college i worked at a small pizza franchise location that sold whole pizzas or pizza by the slice 
 after we closed we had a policy where we would continue to sell pizza that was in the window while we cleaned we just would n't make any new pizza 
 normally this was fine mostly we would get people from the other businesses in the strip mall wanting a late night snack 
 anyways one night this lady and here two daughters come in like half an hour after we closed 
 i was already stacking chairs at this point which is one of the last things we do 
 i say hello as she walks in and say we are closed but would gladly sell her some of the slices we have left 
 she just ignored me 
 here is how the rest of our encounter went 
 -lady standing at the register : are you going to help me or not '' 
 -me : all we have left is pepperoni how many slices would you like '' -lady : slices 
 i do n't wa n't that 
 i want a some kind pizza and we are in a hurry so make it quick '' -me : sorry mam but we closed over 45 mins ago the <unk> are off 
 i would gladly sell you what we have left '' 
 -lady : what 
 your lights are still on which means you are n't closed you should still be making pizzas 
 whatever give me everything you have left 
 -me : box up pizza charge her for a whole pizza even though its a slice short 
 <unk> her money ok mam here is your pizza your total is $ x.xx 
 i charged you for a whole pizza to save you money '' -lady : what 
 that is n't a whole pizza you ca n't charge me for that 
 it 's missing a slice '' 
 one of her daughter 's explains how i am saving her money -me : again your total is $ x.xx '' 
 -lady : ok that 's fine 
 it 's half price right '' 
 -me : why is it half price '' 
 -lady : because you are closing '' we go back and fourth a for a bit she asks for the manager 
 i go get the owner who was cleaning in the back -lady : your employee was being very rude and was trying to charge me full price when it should be half '' <unk> : lady we are closed no half price pizza 
 <unk> no pizza at all '' grabs pizza box and throws it in the trash please leave '' 
 the lady stormed out with her daughters 
 ha epic that the owner had my back and told her to leave 
 so yesterday i was called to the managers office and told that i had a customer complaint that they needed to go over with me 
 needless to say i was with the manager for about an hour on this but i will not give you a play by play recap 
 i will just do a quick run through 
 the customer called and complained because of the fact that i rang her up too quickly 
 my department tends to be pretty busy customer wise and i have a lot of regulars too 
 well apparently it turns out that the complaint i got made the store manager dig into my records a bit 
 which when i was told this made me think i might of screwed something up big time 
 well after a little bit of talking about averages in our department he told me that a single cashier does not get the customer numbers i do and then he called in my supervisor 
 the supervisor then said your in for it now and gave a small laugh 
 the manager said he had gone through the transaction reports on my numbers and that roughly a quarter of total store sales went through my register this year alone and that he had called our district manager on the matter 
 the district manager has also looked over the information and approved a small bonus for you and starting next month you will become the store training supervisor 
 your going to be train our newer cashiers on the registers and they will be helping you in your department for training 
 you will have a little more of a work load but it is a higher pay grade for you and looks at my supervisor and said since that would be on <unk> with your pay level your going to be raised a level also 
 so the details of my new position is one week a month i will be training new cashiers up front and showing them the ropes 
 i will be involved in hiring of new cashiers also 
 i also now have to deal with schedules for the new cashiers for my week i get them and i have been given access to the system for this stuff which luckily my terminal in my department can do 
 so wish me luck everyone 
 <unk> 
 got paperwork done 
 my bonus will be on my next check 1,200 bucks 
 thanks everyone for the support 
 sorry i know my grammar is horrible but also usually only on here for 10 minutes if that on here 
 i start vacation tuesday my first day as trainer starts when i return 
 wish me luck 
 i run a small charity thrift store 
 really there are only two staff members myself the general retail manager for the organization and a part time clerk 
 we do n't offer a dealer price/curtosey like some store even though customers still try 
 now my name tag only has my name not my title as general manager 
 this is important to the story 
 lair dealer lady ldl : i 'm ready to checkout 
 thriftstorebettie : alright would you like a bag today 
 ldl : no that 's fine just so you know i have a deal with the manager to get the employee pricing on my purchases 
 thriftstorebettie : um.. really 
 i do n't have any notes about that can you tell me who you made the deal with part time clerk 
 charity worker 
 ldl : neither of them the manager 
 thriftstorebettie : i 'm sorry i just do n't know anything about that 
 ldl : do n't make me call her and tell her how terrible your treating me 
 thriftstorebettie : you know what i 'll give her a call and get this straitened out for you no problem note i 've already picked up the phone and started to dial my own cellphone number 
 ldl : wait 
 don ... thriftstorebettie : answering my cellphone this is thriftstorebettie with charity thrift store 
 thriftstorebettie : talking into the store phone hi 
 this is thriftstorebettie from the thrift store calling i have ldl hear and she says she has a deal worked out with you to get employee pricing 
 how do i process that 
 thriftstorebettie : talking into my cellphone what 
 no ... ldl : what 
 oh my god 
 turns bright red gets super huffy and storms out i start laughing my ass off 
 totally unprofessional but seriously do n't lie to clerks 
 you look like a major asshole 
 also ldl shops here off and on and always try to get a discount always 
 so this was some petty revenge bullshit but worth it.so here is the full story when you call my store i always attempt to answer my phone even if it is to tell you to hold because at least then you know someone will be with you 
 about two weeks ago i answered the phone and it was a gentleman asking about the cost of tires 
 well this is a standard thing i can do tire quotes easy and since i know the state tax tables and other costs of installation fees i can give you total including tax 
 which according to everyone i talk to on the phone no one else in town does this 
 so we make many sales just from being able to give a to the penny cost 
 jumping ahead to the next day the gentleman comes in and purchases 4 tires 
 nothing abnormal about this he came in around 8 am and that was that 
 about 6 pm i get a call from the gentleman 
 he was asking some information on the road hazard warrenty he purchased and some of the cashiers do not explain the coverage so i go over the warrenty information 
 coverage does not cover vandalism or <unk> or <unk> driving 
 so <unk> the tires is not covered 
 well he tells me that he was driving home from work when his brakes went out and he had to ditch the vehicle or end up in a possible t-bone because he was near a intersection with the major highway through town 
 i would have done the same 
 well i asked if everyone was ok. he said yes but two of his tires got badly damaged one was torn up out right and the other had a bad goose egg on the side 
 well i told him unfortunately this type of damage was not covered under the warrenty 
 he calmly replied i was afraid of that and he asks the costs of replacing just the two tires 
 he did not sound mad at me and he was pretty calm which we get calls like this from time to time but usually end in someone yelling at me over the phone 
 so i decided since he was being nice i would try to go above expectations 
 so i ask the gentleman to hold while i look up the tires and cost 
 he agrees and i put him on hold 
 so i call up the assistant manager and tell him what is going on the guy bought 4 tires that morning and how they were damaged 
 i tell him normally something like this is not covered but the man was on the phone and was not angry and was inquiring about cost to replace 
 if we can at least comp one of the tires 
 well the manager tells me to do it since i felt <unk> enough to even ask to do this and only one tire since the tires the man got were on the more pricey side 
 so i switch back over to the line with the gentleman 
 i told the gentleman i was able to get permission to comp one of the tires and gave him the price for the other 
 the man was very happy to hear this and i got his name and info so when he showed up with the tires to comp the one tire 
 which would take him a couple of days to come in because his car was in the shop having his breaks repaired 
 two days later the gentleman showed up and i rang up the order and he told me to thank the person on the phone 
 i told him that was me he talked to and he then said i want you to know you have a very kind gentle and sultry voice on the phone 
 well i did not know what sultry meant at the time and thought it was weird but said thanks and he left 
 i later googled sultry and now realize that was kind of creepy 
 well i was off work yesterday and the department manager called me which is unusual 
 he normally will just text me if he needs me to come in early or later than normal 
 so i answer my phone figuring somethings hit the fan and he needs help quick 
 no luck on that 
 apparently the guy called and asked if i was working yesterday and the manager told him i was off and the dude asked him if he could have my home number 
 the manager refused that 
 well he said around two hours later a delivery guy showed up with flowers <unk> to me and the card had a phone number that had the dudes cell phone 
 as a note i am male also and happily married 
 so my wife when i told her what happened she just laughed her butt off and jokingly told me to let me know when the wedding was going to be 
 so yup i officially have a creepy <unk> now 
 tl dr : was nice to a customer and now he is sending me flowers at work and asking people for my phone number 
 <unk> style 
 edit : ok so he showed up again yesterday and i told him i was not interested 
 oddly enough he took it well and apologized if he seemed a little too forward 
 he was apparently having a long streak of real bad luck 
 apparently he just recently moved into town and has not had much a good time in doing so as place he was living in recently had a pipe burst and did some major damage and he lost alot of his things from the flooding and the landlord had to get it fixxed but the damage was real bad so he is living in a hotel room for 3 weeks while the landlord has people doing the repairs and he had nails in his tires from somewhere and was why he originally bought tires that morning and then his breaks went out on the car 
 so admittedly he had some shitty luck and he thought it was getting worse when i told him on the phone warrenty did not cover <unk> damage but i was nice enough to comp and help him out 
 i told him i hope his luck gets better.hi everyone i work at a big box retail store that charges people a membership fee in order to shop at our store 
 due to this fee some customers act very entitled which is to be expected i guess 
 here is an interaction i had last week with an entitled <unk> aka eb 
 i get a call on the walkie saying that there is a problem in one of our healthy food isles 
 i quickly make my way there and hear eb yelling at a fellow employee who i will refer to as ryan 
 eb : what do you mean you dont have any more quinoa '' 
 ryan : sorry mam i 've checked the computer and its showing we do not have any more in stock '' 
 eb : you people are so useless 
 what 's the point of paying to shop here if you people are good for nothing '' 
 this is where i cut in 
 me : hi there 
 as ryan already told you there is no more quinoa is there anythjng else i can help you with '' 
 eb : yes get me some damn quinoa '' 
 me : sorry mam there isnt any in the isle and someone 's already checked to see if its in stock if you come back tomo ... '' eb : i own you 
 i demand that you bring me quinoa now 
 i do n't care if you need to go to another store to get it 
 i want my quinoa and i want it now 
 i pay the price you 're no more than my <unk> '' 
 the amount of anger going through me was incredible 
 i 've never dealt with someone this hostile and ridiculous in my life 
 i 'm usually a pretty calm person but after being <unk> like this something inside me snapped 
 me : just because you pay to shop here does not give you the right to act like a stuck up bitch '' 
 she was stunned 
 her jaw dropped and she turned completely white 
 this didnt last more than 5 seconds because she immediately started to turn bright red 
 eb : i 'm going to have you fired 
 i 'm going to fire you 
 you cant talk to me like that '' 
 i walked away and expected to be fired 
 but i did n't care i felt so relieved 
 about 15 minutes later i find out my manager had heard the whole thing <unk> her membership and banned her from the store 
 ah sweet justice 
 i work in a gift shop in australia and we also sell lotto tickets for the most part customers are polite and i do n't have to deal with rudeness very often 
 usually only 1 of us is there at any point in time unless it is christmas or a big lotto draw 
 so basically if i am there alone i 'm the boss 
 it 's a slow day so i 'm just standing behind the counter greeting people and letting them have a look around 
 there are 2 teenage girls i guess around 13 years old in the birthday cards having a giggle at them and a father and his young daughter i guess the daughter to be 3-4 years old and they are looking for a gift for mum 
 i ca n't see the girls in the cards properly since they are behind the shelves but i overhear the following 
 girl 1 : i guess he 's ok looking but steve was really nice to me so i gave him a blowjob 
 girl 2 : oh yeah steve is pretty nice 
 i consider going over there to tell them to shut up when i see the little girl look at her dad and ask what does blowjob mean daddy 
 i do n't think he had heard the other 2 girls and he looked shocked and muttered something about when you are older '' 
 the little girl was persistent and said what does it mean daddy '' 
 i went around to the 2 teens in the cards and could hear them dropping swear words while seemingly talking about some slut '' 
 i ask them politely to not swear in the store especially since there is a child present 
 they roll their eyes and go back to looking at the cards 
 this whole time the little girl has been trying to get out of her father what a blowjob is and looking baffled he says something along the lines of when a girl loves a boy it 's just something they do but not until you are older 
 now please stop asking and tell me what you think of this for mummy '' 
 at this stage i 'm back behind the counter and i serve someone getting lotto and i can again hear the 2 teens swearing and laughing 
 followed by a <unk> that bitch will come back '' 
 i finish with the customer and head back around there and now i 'm mad 
 me : i asked you to stop swearing please leave 
 girl 1 : <unk> no 
 you ca n't make us 
 me : yes i can please leave now 
 the little girl over there has started repeating your <unk> and other customers can hear your language 
 girl 1 : it 's a free country and i can say whatever i fucking want 
 girl 2 laughs and rolls her eyes me : i do n't have to serve you and have every right to kick you out of a space we pay for because as you said free country and all that 
 now get out before i call security to escort you out 
 this was a complete <unk> i 'm not even sure what security there is they walk out swearing their heads off and threats of my mother '' 
 the father and daughter come and pay for a nice picture frame to put a picture of themselves in for mum 
 i chat with them for a bit and on their way out i hear the little girl say 
 i love you daddy can i give you a blowjob '' 
 needless to say he rushed her out looking mortified 
 a few minutes later girl 1 comes in with her mother and i brace myself for whatever rant i 'm about to cop 
 mother : i asked girl 1 to buy a card and you kicked her out 
 why '' 
 slightly snarky kind of attitude me : they were swearing in the shop a young girl overheard the word blowjob '' and started putting her dad in an awkward situation when asking him to explain the word 
 i asked them to stop swearing and using that language 
 when they did n't i told them to leave 
 mother to girl 1 : you what 
 give me your phone now 
 girl 1 hands over phone with tears in her eyes how dare you 
 that poor girl 
 you are not to see girl 2 again 
 you are grounded 
 she turns back to me and speaks sweetly she told me you threw her out for opening the music cards i 'm really sorry for her behavior 
 me : no worries enjoy your day 
 the mother ranted loudly at her crying daughter on the way out and it was glorious 
 **tl : dr little girl asks dad if she can give him a blowjob i get to kick 2 bitches out of the shop girl gets grounded 
 ** edit : thanks for all the comments 
 i just got back from sleep and work 
 to address a couple of comments 
 i did n't rat her out to her mum about the context the word blowjob was used in because i figured it 's possible she was showing off to her friend or trying to sound cool 
 though honestly it would not surprise me if it were true 
 the father probably should have just said i do n't know '' but the look on his face ... he just panicked 
 i 'll be sure to post more stories at some point but this is easily one of the best ones this homeless man always comes to my cash so i can give him some bills for his change 
 he 's young in his twenties and instead of simply begging on the street with a cup he plays some good music with an old <unk> 
 i 'm the only person who will take the time to open my cash and sit there counting his change and give him bills so he 's really appreciative 
 he 's been a regular for a few months 
 today as a thank you for me changing his money he left me a nice tip only my second tip in a year of working as a <unk> and told me how much he appreciates my help 
 i tried to not accept it but he just smiled and left 
 that man was more generous than 99 % of the rich <unk> that i cater to 
 he made my day 
 edit : wow 
 first page on tfr 
 thank you 
 i wish all that karma goes straight from here to him 
 i 'm a mess this morning 
 last night as i was calling my cat <unk> in for dinner he was hit by a car 
 he was n't supposed to be outside 
 but he got out and as i was calling him a car went by 
 i heard the <unk> and my baby went flying right up to the house and collapsed 
 he died in my arms moments later 
 so 
 yeah 
 i had him for ten years 
 i grew up with him 
 he was my baby 
 i have never felt so hopeless and hurt as i did last night 
 i 'm still a huge mess 
 god 
 i ca n't believe he 's gone 
 onto the story or rant or whatever 
 i 'm much slower than usual this morning and i just feel weak 
 i was behind and did n't quite have donuts ready when my assistant manager asks me what 's wrong 
 i told her and just broke down and at the same time this rude bitch of a lady walks up to the counter and just about yells uhm 
 hello 
 where are the donuts '' 
 i asked am to help her and escaped to the back to contain myself 
 am was talking to the lady trying to help her 
 lady says what 's her problem 
 i need donuts '' 
 i did n't hear am 's response but the next thing the lady says is well it 's just a stupid animal 
 she should n't be so upset '' 
 then just starts demanding donuts again 
 god 
 just fuck off 
 i know some people do n't see their pets as family but a bit of empathy goes a long fucking way 
 i just lost a huge part of my life my *baby* 
 i 'm just so upset right now 
 edit : thank you all so much for your kind words and internet hugs 
 i 'm reading each and every comment.i work at a huge coffee giant known for a blended drink straight from hell and mediocre cup of joe 
 usually seeing a gaggle of teenagers wander into my work means three things : a drink i do n't like making/ how much does a water cost 
 can i sample something 
 / a mess i do n't want to clean up 
 there 's rarely a well <unk> <unk> so i usually expect the worse 
 well yesterday a boy about <unk> 
 wanders in and asked for a large water 
 that 's all he gets and goes out on our patio and proceeds to lay out all his books on the table in the shade and start his homework 
 time goes by and every time i look up he 's moved tables to stay in the shade 
 i do n't think much of it 
 it 's about 30 minutes before close and i go out to stack the patio and the kid 's still out there 
 i start to stack up the rest of the patio around him when he looks up at me and asks if we 're closed 
 i say no but in about 30 minutes we will be and he looks back down 
 i 'm use to customers pushing limits with our patio so i 'm continuing to stack chairs and figure i 'll just have to get his later 
 i turn around and he 's packing up his things 
 then he starts stacking his chair 
 i tell him he does n't have to but he says no it 's okay i want to 
 i thank him and my coworker calls me over the headset and asks for help 
 i thank him and run back inside 
 after a little rush which last maybe 10 minutes i look out at the patio 
 and this kid is still stacking the patio ... and he 's almost done 
 i go out and tell him he does n't have to and he 's keeps assuring me it 's no big deal 
 i put down the <unk> and he helps 
 i offer him a drink for all the help but he <unk> but asks if he can still use the bathroom 
 honestly just the whole thing blew me away 
 i 've been in retail for awhile and usually teenagers spell trouble 
 never have i meet a kid so polite 
 thank you to parents who still do it right 
 so i work at this <unk> shop i 'm doing my business helping customers before they go <unk> and buy nothing when this old lady walks up to me 
 i ask hey how are you doing '' she says well '' 
 i ask if i could help her find anything and she asks do you have anything that smells like patchouli '' 
 i show her the only fragrance that has it in it 
 she says oh that really wo n't do 
 what about something with musk '' 
 i showed her some and she was n't having that either 
 what 's your strongest smell '' she asked 
 i told her they 're all equally strong 
 she goes on to say well i went over to visit my daughter and grandchildren to spend the night for mother 's day but when i got there they were n't home 
 i walked into one of my <unk> room and found a huge bag of weed 
 i smoked the whole thing and forgot how much it smells '' 
 i told her she came to the right place 
 she says thank you so very much 
 i 'm high as hell right now '' 
 she went on to tell me about life dating black men in the 70 's how much <unk> she used to do and all her lesbian experiences 
 & gt tl dr : grandmother smoked her grandson 's stash came to my shop talked for an hour about being high for 15 years of her lifespotted this yesterday while i was out shopping 
 a group of <unk> all in school uniform were in a mini supermarket getting a few bits one of them gets pushed into a rack of bottles full of sauce <unk> and herbs near one of the tills 
 the rest of the group runs off out of the shop but the one who got pushed into the rack stays where he is 
 instead of getting angry or running off he goes to one of the staff and says the following : & gt alright man listen i 've made a bit of a mess just there on the <unk> rack do you lot have a sweeping brush and a scoop 
 i 'll clean it up for you 
 the staff were amazed by how to the point he was anyone else would have just left 
 i hung around to watch what happened for health and safety they couldnt let him sweep up the glass but he paid for most of the damage it was about 35 <unk> he paid 30. he walked off with a smile and an ice cream and the manager was wondering if they could hire him edit : i 'll be damned my first gold 
 thank you : i was with my manager doing cash pulls around 11pm on the first of our four front end customer service tills 
 this middle aged woman walks in asks if she can get a money order 
 manager says no but i ask her if i can take the nice lady on the last register as to not <unk> the pulls 
 she agrees and i begin 
 the customer never did get to get her name tells me that this money order is for rent and that she is grateful that i am able to take her 
 i tell her that customer service <unk> closed at 10pm but she had arrived just in time and found someone who is <unk> all over the front end 
 she tells me she 's grateful to have run in just in time for this and to have found someone willing to help 
 this was her last option for a store to get a money order for rent and that if it was n't deposited by business open for what is now today she 'd be charged an extra $ 100 as a late fee 
 i 'm glad to be of help and begin processing the order as she grabs her card to pay 
 all <unk> to be paid she swipes her card 
 met with an error for insufficient funds 
 she grabs her phone and opens her banks app and tells me that she 's 0.70 short and wo n't be able to pay rent after all 
 $ 100 for 0.70 short is unacceptable 
 i <unk> through my pockets and find <unk> coins that come out to <unk> toss it on her order and tell her to go ahead and swipe again 
 transaction goes through 
 lady is almost in tears 
 asks if there 's a manager around she can speak to about me 
 tell her that my immediate manager is standing behind me and just saw it happen 
 she wants more 
 informed her there 's a survey on the receipt and a customer comment box behind her she can put in her words on my service 
 she spends almost 20 minutes writing before dropping it in and thanks me again before heading out 
 i 'm just glad to be of good help to such a nice little lady 
 merry christmas and happy holidays all 
 remember the small things can have incredible <unk> 
 edit - i 'd like to take a moment and say thank you for the gold : please though use that three bucks to keep some change in your pocket if you 're a retail slave too and use it to help out the nice customers when they 're short a bit 
 i sell and install high end door hardware at a small family business 
 the hardware i sell starts at $ 100 per door and goes up to $ 1000 per door and being so we mostly work with high end <unk> 
 basically most customers are n't too price sensitive 
 we also tell them we ca n't compete with online prices *before we even start looking at hardware 
 * my job is to help the customer find hardware that matches their home and then do a walk-through of their home to get door handings thicknesses back sets and <unk> size 
 it 's actually really fun walking through expensive homes as they 're finishing being built 
 i had a husband and wife come in a few months ago and i took them through the showroom showing which options would go well with their new home 
 it took a little over an hour and we chose all the <unk> hardware but <unk> hardware for the master bedroom lower level and set them up with special plates for their exterior doors 
 i gave them a quote while they were there showing which <unk> get what hardware and they seemed happy with it 
 great 
 another happy customer 
 they have me email them a copy of the quote and they say they 'll be in touch for me to do the walk-through 
 a few days go by and i get an email from them saying they found everything *much* cheaper online with free shipping of course 
 and asking if i can price match 
 & gt **me : ** sorry as i said when we first started i ca n't price match as i have a large showroom and offer design and technical help 
 & gt **customer : ** i can get everything for almost $ 20 cheaper though per hardware set & gt **me : ** sorry but there 's not much i can do 
 i did help you choose your selections for over an hour though and with the hardware you picked out you 'll need to get all the specs right when ordering 
 & gt **customer : ** well everything is much cheaper online so that 's what i 'm going to have to go with 
 so a few weeks go by and i get a call from the customer 's builder 
 he 's complaining that most of the door hardware was delivered wrong and telling me someone needed to come to the job site and sort it out 
 i told the builder his customer did n't buy from me but had mentioned ordering online 
 the builder sighed said ok and hung up 
 today i heard the rest of the story 
 apparently the customer took my quote and ordered online directly off of that 
 my quote did n't have any technical specs for the hardware so they guessed their way through the whole thing 
 when the <unk> tried to install it nothing fit 
 the builder told the customer to send everything back and order from my company but the customer was too embarrassed so they ordered from a competitor much further away 
 i bet with the restock fee on their online order and the additional travel <unk> for the other hardware company the customer probably spent twice as much as would have if they just went with me.today i was shopping at a big box department store in a very affluent community 
 i got in the checkout line and noticed that the <unk> lady in front of me had a bunch of inexpensive toys 
 she said with a smile almost apologetically i 'm grabbing all of your dinosaurs today '' while gesturing toward her basket 
 there were little baggies of small plastic dinosaurs - she had purchased about 20 of them 
 the cashier giggled 
 haha oh no you ca n't do that '' 
 she joked some little kid is going to be so upset '' 
 i know right '' 
 they were kidding of course - i mean the chances that someone is going to show up wanting those dinosaurs today had to be pretty <unk> 
 what are you going to do with them '' 
 the cashier asked 
 oh well i keep my eye out for things like this on sale 
 and i save them 
 at the end of the year i put together gift sets for organization for needy children '' 
 whoa 
 i mean it 's march 
 this lady spends all year collecting small gifts for needy children 
 i 'm sure she ends up with some pretty awesome stuff in the mix too 
 mad props to the nice lady 
 she seriously made me think about what i could be doing to make a little bit of difference in the lives of others 
 <unk> i 'm on an express checkout a few years ago and this guy comes up with about 10 bunches of different flowers and a roll of wrapping paper 
 he tells me he forgot his <unk> and was buying all the flowers he could carry 
 i just laugh along because he was n't stressed about it and was laughing at how he forgot 
 he pays for the flowers and takes them all in his arms and leaves 
 in my store where the express checkout is you can see out the door so i could see everything he did next 
 he rolled out the wrapping paper and opened all the bunches of flowers and began arranging them 
 he spent the next 5-10 minutes arranging the flowers and when he was do n't he started rolling them up with the wrapping paper into what became the most amazing and biggest bouquet of flowers i 've ever seen 
 he just stood up and held the bouquet in his arms as he left like the <unk> bastard he was 
 a young woman probably 18 or so came into the bank with her mother 
 the young woman had down <unk> and her mother was showing her how to do some banking -- checking her balance paying bills and taking out some cash 
 the young woman was very polite and her mother was very specific explaining to the daughter how to be clear about what she wants 
 for example when the daughter asked for cash she said twenty sixty '' and then the mother specified that she should ask for the total amount she wanted first $ 60 and then what kind of bills she wanted three 20s 
 even though it was her first time at the bank i can tell you that this young woman was far more clear and specific about what she wanted than many older customers with more experience who expect me to read their mind 
 at the end of the transaction i went over her receipt with her and <unk> everything as i do with all customers and she seemed really grateful for the summary 
 as she was leaving i heard her say to the mother i did it '' 
 and the mum was really proud 
 there 's your daily dose of heartwarming from <unk> red tape factory actually there were a few others but this is my favourite 
 my last story seemed to do pretty well so i figured i 'd send in another 
 for the sake of redditors <unk> this one will lack any black <unk> incidents 
 as some background i 'm from a fairly small town that consists of the place i worked another chain restaurant i 'll call cookie bucket and a <unk> of fast food chains 
 i used to work third shift <unk> at a large <unk> chain restaurant that focused mostly on breakfast food 
 one morning i was finishing up my prep for the next shift filling sugar salt and paper napkin holders etc 
 about half an hour from the end of my shift when a very harassed looking man walks in and straight up to the counter 
 i ask if i can help him expecting a large coffee to go and he fixes me with this panicked look and asks if he could please have some blueberry pancakes 
 i feel my face kind of blank and i 'm sure i gave him a wtf look before stating that we do n't sell pancakes 
 we sell the other breakfast food that 's basically the same thing 
 would he like one of those 
 he shook his head looking increasingly distressed 
 customer : please 
 i will pay you whatever you need 
 i 'll pay you for however many <unk> it would cost 
 but i need blueberry pancakes 
 me : <unk> to look at our chef sir <unk> uhhh sir awesome 
 are we able to sell pancakes 
 at this point our manager is standing about 2 feet away waiting to switch out our register drawer for the morning shift 's drawer 
 sir awesome turns from the grill and is about to answer when the customer <unk> out please 
 my wife is pregnant 
 she hates cookie bucket and they ca n't be frozen 
 i do n't know why it has to be pancakes i just know it does 
 she loves our restaurant and i just do n't know what else to do '' 
 i swear he sounded near tears 
 the moment he said my wife is pregnant '' 
 <unk> just sort of stopped and even the surrounding customers all older <unk> had this deer-in-the-headlights look 
 after a few seconds our manager looks at the cook and says get this man some pancakes 
 just charge him for a waffle '' 
 i thought the guy would start crying 
 he started thanking us profusely as i wrote up his ticket 
 the cook ended up producing some really awesome looking blueberry pancakes from the grill and passed them along to the man with his best wishes 
 after leaving a really great tip about $ 10 
 <unk> 
 he all but danced out of the restaurant looking like we had just given him <unk> life 
 tl dr : we saved a man 's life once ... edit : oh my gods guys front page 
 you all are awesome 
 : i feel honored 
 hi tfr i 've got a cute kid story for you today 
 i 'm not a kid person in general but these two just about made my day yesterday 
 at the beginning of my shift two little boys came up to my register and asked where the pokemon books were 
 big bro : i already have a book with one hundred and thirty pokemon so now i need a book with one hundred and twenty more 
 lil bro : and i want a hundred and twenty more too 
 me : well good news our books definitely have that many 
 there are like 700+ pokemon these days it 's bananas 
 so i told them where the books were and suggest they go to customer services if they need help finding them because i was n't able to leave my register 
 some time later they came back with their parents to check out 
 they <unk> the whole time about how much they love pokemon which one was their favorite <unk> and it was just super cute but their mom was the icing on the cake : mom : <unk> right 
 me : oh no my boyfriend turns <unk> next month and he still talks about pokemon just like that 
 mom : ... oh my god.this story is my favourite one to tell new staff members about how the customer does n't always win 
 it 's a long read but very worth it 
 by the way this story takes place in australia 
 i worked at a bakery as a manager of sorts which involved a lot of <unk> about <unk> goods we made cakes entirely from scratch something that 's uncommon where i live on a friday afternoon a couple of old ladies in nice clothes come in and completely ignore the queue and anxiously shout that they need a cake for tomorrow a <unk> nightmare 
 i politely tell them that i 'll be with them as soon as i can as the shop was filled with regulars who were loyal to the shop and i did n't want to <unk> them 
 this concept seemed to be lost on these lovely ladies as they pushed their way to the coffee machine and told the barista a timid 16 year old girl that they <unk> needed to order a cake 
 she seemed a bit intimidated by them but stood her ground and informed them that she 's not in charge of that earning her a high five from me later 
 they literally huffed i could hear both their <unk> separately at the same time 
 i had taken a mental note of where they were in the line and gave one of the regulars a former employee an exasperated look and he winked and gestured for them to be served earning him a free coffee for the day 
 the following conversation is word for word 
 the ladies are known as arrogant <unk> 1 & amp 2 ab1 & amp ab2 me : hi there sorry about ... ab1 : finally '' 
 me : ... the wait it 's pretty frantic at the <unk> '' ab2 : i 'm having a party i need to order a cake for tomorrow '' 
 me : we usually require 48 hours notice on cake orders otherwise there is a $ 10 surcharge '' 
 this was optional on my end i was going to try to build some rapport 
 ab2 : <unk> we only found out about it this morning '' yeah ... a party you heard about this morning and need a custom cake for i looked over my shoulder and quietly told them that i understand and i hate that policy so i 'll waive the fee if we keep it between us 
 you would think they would be appreciative but no ... they smelled <unk> 
 i showed them our cakes and they decided on an 10 '' <unk> '' vanilla slice cake with blue icing on top with some edible flowers $ 65 i smelled <unk> <unk> and she had an <unk> bag 
 i could 've charged $ 95 and i took their $ 15 deposit 
 i had showed them our range of blue colours and they agreed on a specific shade of blue 
 i started at <unk> that saturday as i was learning how to cook as i was trained in coffee mainly 
 so it was me and the owner a total character 
 he was 110 % irish so naturally we had a few <unk> and he taught me and we joked around till opening time which was always a blast 
 i told him about ab1 & amp 2 and he rolled his eyes and called them <unk> <unk> and taught me how to hand craft chocolate flowers for their cake which was fucking awesome 
 by 2pm we were exhausted but had some fresh staff handling the customers 
 enter ab2 the <unk> one 
 i could hear her shouting into her phone from the back 
 i gave irish a look making him chuckle and throw air punches before heading out the front with her cake 
 me : hi there ab2 she saw me and gave a look of <unk> great start we just finished your cake 3-4 hours ago would you like to have a look '' 
 ab2 : of course 
 you think i 'll take it without seeing it '' 
 i chuckled and showed her the cake and she let out a disgusted groan 
 ab2 : this is n't what i ordered '' 
 me : oh i 'm sorry i was tired and gave her the benefit of the doubt what did you order '' 
 ab2 : its the wrong colour '' 
 me : oh i 'm sorry what was it meant to be '' 
 ab2 : its the wrong blue '' 
 she then proceeds to pull out a selection of blue swatches used for paint colours 
 ab2 : i wanted this one ... give me a discount '' 
 i 've had enough by now 
 me : the price is $ 65 and with your $ 15 deposit the remaining due is $ 50 '' 
 ab2 : this is completely unacceptable i.. <unk> to speak to your <unk> '' me : i am the manager '' 
 pretty much true at the time ab2 : well ... i want to speak to the owner '' 
 me : k '' i fetch irish who 's already in a shit mood as his wife 's coming in soon and he comes out the front 
 irish : <unk> whats thee <unk> '' 
 he knows everyone within a <unk> <unk> at all times so a barrage of greetings hit him and he says hello to 10 people is 10 seconds in 10 different ways a skill he had 
 ab2 : your- '' irish : do ya wan the <unk> <unk> or not '' 
 ab2 : i was <unk> discount- '' irish : thee price es <unk> he says <unk> '' 
 he then proceeds to hold he cake over the bin 
 irish : <unk> or noh '' 
 ab2 : i wan- '' <unk> 
 he throws the cake in the bin and the store <unk> in laughter 
 and i thrust her deposit into her hands 
 irish : <unk> '' 
 she did n't come <unk> time lurker first time poster there is no dana only zuul ... this is a story about sir 
 in college i worked in a large retail store part time during the year and full time during the summer 
 my second summer on the job i had been sort of promoted to second in charge within the <unk> department 
 all day every day i’d maintain the aisles and back room and stock shelves 
 one day i am refolding a wall of towels that i had watched get <unk> destroyed by a family <unk> their bathroom 
 i’m slightly grumps because we have all of the towels open and displayed in plain sight and customers often unknowingly damage the towels when they open them and then decide they do not want them anymore 
 every time they would replace them by <unk> the towel into a heap and stuffing it into the shelf often snagging the fabric we had horrible metal shelves that corporate refused to replace 
 i’m sorting through the crumpled towels attempting to carefully <unk> them from the <unk> of <unk> when a new employee approaches me 
 & gt ne : um sorry 
 could you help me please 
 & gt me : hey yeah 
 what’s up 
 & gt ne : well uh 
 there’s a guy who needs some help and i’m not sure how to help him 
 i think he’s chinese but i can’t understand what he wants 
 & gt me : ok sure 
 where is he 
 & gt *she points towards vacuums giggles uncomfortably and then walks away 
 * i’m a little confused that she just booked it but she’s new and doesn’t really understand how to hand off customers yet 
 i leave my department and see a little old asian guy wandering near the vacuum aisle 
 i casually walk on up to him 
 & gt me : <unk> can i help <unk> 
 oh <unk> i almost step back as sir starts waving his hands around like a lunatic 
 it was a little overwhelming 
 he’s spinning his arms around and reaching out towards me and <unk> his hands around in a lewd manner 
 he even mimicked spraying something on his face 
 i now understand why ne got intimidated 
 if his face hadn’t been so <unk> and humiliated i would’ve thought he was just being rude 
 he continued to make these motions while i looked at him attempting to understand what was going on 
 he pointed at his shopping cart towards the shelves and then started the motions again 
 that’s when it clicked : i was in a real life game of charades 
 once i figured this out i began to focus on what he was doing 
 i also looked at his cart saw a sun hat and <unk> and realized what it was 
 he wanted a personal fan that <unk> water on your face 
 i motioned for him to come with me and led him to the back of the store where an end cap had a display of plastic fan bottles 
 the look of happiness and relief on his face was like sunshine 
 his excitement was almost tangible as he picked out a couple and then began to mime out another item 
 i spent 15 more minutes helping him find the items he was unable to locate all through his <unk> and gestures i will never forget him describing hot sauce 
 i hadn’t had that much fun with a customer until that point or since 
 he was absolutely delightful 
 he eventually became a regular at the store 
 he began to call me jean '' meh it starts with an j so close enough 
 i also began to carry a pad of paper and a <unk> in order to help us out sometimes 
 a friend of mine taught me some basic formal chinese for when i was confused just simple stuff like “how many ” “i don’t understand ” <unk> draw it” 
 my last year working there sir brought in his son to the store and brought him to my department 
 <unk> son was just as cheery as his father 
 he thanked me for being such a help to his father and apologized for any time it took me away from my job 
 i was absolutely touched that he had mentioned me to his family 
 sir was well known and well liked in the store by the time i had left and i was certain that he’d have a charades partner for as long as he wanted 
 edit : wow guys 
 this <unk> of support and good vibes is one of the reasons this is my favorite sub 
 all of these stories you 've posted about your experiences are beautiful 
 i know i’m biased but i firmly believe working in retail improves your character 
 although retail is a tough line of work to be in it <unk> you and helps you discover that you have the ability to make a difference in <unk> lives no matter how small your action may seem at the time 
 it’s lovely that through all the issues and crap we have to deal with all i see on this sub is a group of amazing people who support and lift each other up 
 you guys blow me away 
 once upon a time i used to work in a small town <unk> pet store 
 the owner and her daughter are what we considered the <unk> and they would usually rotate days so that at least one of them was present in the store at all times on any given day 
 the mother t and the daughter h also just so happen to <unk> in different animal areas in the store 
 h oversees all of the fish herself especially the salt water tanks since they can be a little <unk> to maintain 
 it 's a slow day and in the later afternoon h and i are just starting the rounds of food and water before we close in a couple of hours when this older lady walks in 
 she starts telling us about her son who is actively in afghanistan somewhere but would be coming home for good soon 
 he loves salt water fish and when he went into the service several years prior he had to give up all of the fish and tanks since there would be no one to care for them properly while he was away 
 she tells us that she has cared for his empty house since he left and wants to get a full salt water tank set up in his living room to surprise him when he gets home 
 this of course hits all the <unk> buttons for us as this old lady is just trying to do something sweet for her military son 
 so we start gathering everything she needs such as the filter system <unk> fake plant life she insisted and fish food etc 
 once we 've walked her through picking out all of the hardware we start getting into her options of live fish to be ordered and picked up later and when it 's all said and done she 's <unk> up a receipt of over $ 1500 
 we 've spent over an hour with her at this point and have made sure to repeatedly tell her everything that she has to do to maintain the tank for the few days until the son gets home 
 we also recommend getting a book for fish tank <unk> that we offer by the register just in case she <unk> anything we tell her 
 as she pulls out a bank envelope to pay it 's only about twenty minutes until closing and therefore we 've been happily helping her for almost two hours 
 she 's just handed the money to h when she drops this <unk> 
 so when i get this stuff to his house i just throw some table salt into the water and the fish will be fine once they get in there '' 
 apparently our two hour conversation went completely in one ear and out the other and h just looks stunned for a moment as she 's unsure of what to say 
 we ended up making a list of every little thing she 'd purchased packed everything into the empty tank and set it in the back room to wait 
 we convinced her that he would be much more excited to set it up himself and after a little talking she took a shine to that idea 
 she paid for a store credit so that he could pick out the fish he wanted and h put her signature on the list and receipt to reassure her that we would n't forget everything was already paid for 
 he came in about a week later with the list and receipt 
 he was incredibly excited and thanked us profusely for not letting his mother take anything home herself as he revealed that she had no one to help her carry the heavy tank 
 he was very grateful for our help and patience and went home a happy guy 
 edit : <unk> is my first story here but i have more 
 this happened only 3 days ago 
 i work at a somewhat large gas station 
 despite its size we typically only have 1 person working at a time 
 we 're never very busy 
 anyway i 'm working the closing shift and the store as always is pretty dead after <unk> 
 a woman walks in she 's skinny tattooed and wearing lots of makeup 
 she wanders around for a long time without really looking for anything in particular 
 i 'm thinking whatever people show up high all the time '' 
 eventually she decides on some things and brings them to the counter 
 i do the standard anything else for <unk> total is '' thing and she starts making small talk 
 & gt '' man pay day sounds good about now '' 
 & gt '' yeah i get my paycheck tomorrow '' 
 & gt '' oh really 
 i get paid every day '' 
 then she leans in closer and looks me in the eyes 
 & gt '' got any big plans with that paycheck of yours '' 
 & gt '' um i 'm saving for school haha ... '' i think i need an adult 
 i 'd love to say that this was my idea but i was only a witness to this moment of genius 
 i was queuing in the ten items or less line in a well-known uk supermarket chain 
 just as the cashier was helping one elderly customer bag her items with the next guy about to unload his items onto the counter a short woman in a business suit pushed her way in between him and the cashier 
 i heard her mumble to him just grabbing lunch i 'm running late '' before <unk> her meal deal which consisted of a sandwich a bottle of juice and a packet of crisps onto the counter 
 i should clarify that i was about third out of six or seven people in this queue and there was only one ten items or less lane the store was busy and we were all trying to buy our lunches 
 as the cashier was helping the first lady with her bags and credit card the guy who was <unk> to be next in line - without saying a <unk> word* to the <unk> - picked her bottle of juice off the counter knelt down and rolled it along the ground towards the back of the queue 
 she turned to him as he picked up her packet of crisps and chucked them to the back of the queue too 
 her expression will be burned into my memory for eternity 
 she could n't legitimately complain because she along with everyone around her was perfectly aware of what she had tried to do 
 plus there was a whole queue of hungry british people <unk> her now 
 she stared daggers at the guy she tried to skip picked up her sandwich then storming off a whole five metres to pick the rest of her lunch off the floor then disappeared back into the aisles in a fit of embarrassed rage 
 the tension <unk> in those few moments made me feel proud to be british 
 i still do n't know if she managed to buy her lunch that <unk> my time in the retail industry i was hired for night shift but training took place in the morning shift 
 this story took place during my training 
 they have a training system that goes like this : 1 day <unk> <unk> days book training 1 day computer training 1 day on the day shift floor to wait for authentication of online testing 
 now they are slow with their <unk> of testing because as it were there was a delay between the modules being ready for the individual employees and the book training to be complete 
 so training took 6 days 
 well on my last day of training i came into the training center and the coordinator for training and employees was dealing with this guy that had a thick <unk> accent 
 he could n't read or write in english she asked me to help him with filing out his job application on the job center machine 
 i happily obliged and took him to one and began testing 
 i put in his name for him i read him the questions i chose the corresponding answer for him and this took about 2 hours because of a mixture of him not understanding the questions and taking a while to answer them 
 but he also kept saying he was a good worker and that he likes working because it keeps him busy 
 i liked him he always smiled and was very friendly 
 after his application was complete i said goodbye to him and wished him good luck 
 well fast forward 2 months later i was walking back to the break room and i saw a man folding clothes in the clothing section that looked like the man i had helped apply for a job just months prior 
 he looked up and saw me with a smile already on his face and he got really happy ran up to me and hugged me 
 he thanked me over and over again and told me he loved working there and that he was so grateful 
 i was really happy for him seeing him make part-time made it even <unk> there is an event at 3 a hockey game 
 usually a pretty big mix of people 
 i just had the weirdest customer ever pull in 
 dude pulls up : roboto : how 
 much 
 is 
 parking 
 me : <unk> ten dollars sir 
 he then proceeds to do slow motion robot <unk> to pull out his wallet 
 noises and all 
 roboto : <unk> 
 cchhh 
 vvvv 
 cha 
 here 
 you 
 go 
 <unk> 
 me : tha ... thank you 
 as he 's pulling away i see a young boy in the back seat with a physical disability smiling his ass off <unk> a toy robot 
 <unk> this guy gets it 
 as for backstory i told you all about some money i found christmas eve and today i had this woman come through with a little girl who was 7 years old 
 the little girl was brought in by her mom so she could spend her christmas money she got from her family which was on a few gift cards 
 she had 35 dollars in total on them all together 
 the little girl tells me all about her bike she found that she loves 
 it had a basket handle bar <unk> and has my little <unk> her favorite cartoon 
 i scan the bike and it rings up to <unk> dollars and change 
 the girl hands me the cards and i run them and give them the remaining total 
 the mom looks at me and said i only have 10 dollars 
 she turns to the little girl and tells her she can not afford the bike 
 the look on her face was heart breaking 
 now on christmas eve i came into 250 dollars in a pass it forward surprise 
 i looked at the mom and told her according to state law the girl was required to have a helmet to ride a bike 
 the mom frowns more and i tell my supervisor to cover the counter for a minute and tell her to follow me 
 i take her over to the helmet section and i see a my little <unk> helmet in the girls size and she tries it on 
 the mom then said i can not afford it 
 i told her not to worry about it 
 we get her some elbow and knee <unk> too 
 i then take them back to the register and have my supervisor to rering the bike and other stuff 
 he then looks at me and realized what was going on and tags my discount onto it 
 i give him the girls gift cards he runs them and i finish paying for the rest and hand the receipt to the mom and told them merry christmas 
 the girl was so excited to get the bike and the mom <unk> trying to thank me 
 i told her i had a kindness given to me and when she could just pay it forward 
 the little girl was so excited as she left and as she was leaving <unk> thank you 
 she then looked at her mom and said i got a new bike 
 after a very <unk> week in which i missed work because i was extremely ill i finally returned to my <unk> spot behind the register 
 since the winter is mighty slow for us i guess one of my bosses got <unk> and decided to tweak our pos settings so new and fun things printed out on our receipt 
 in hindsight it really was my fault for leaving her unattended with the register for a week 
 one of these new and fun things happened to include the receipt now printing the first and last name of the cashier who rang them up 
 i 'm not a crazy privacy <unk> but this this freaked me out and pissed me off 
 the receipt already prints out our employee code when we ring the sale 
 i called my boss and asked her what pos option she had <unk> it so i could <unk> it back to off 
 imagine my shock at her shock on why i would want to do this 
 what is so bad about the receipt printing the first and last name of the cashier 
 oh i do n't know 
 irate customers having personal information crazy customers having personal information any customer having personal information 
 the list goes on 
 my first and last name are one google search away from my address my facebook my embarrassing <unk> teenage blogs that i keep meaning to delete 
 my boss told me to leave the option turned on 
 so i created a fake facebook account using a male name and sent her a private message detailing how i thought she was so pretty and how i was too shy to say that when she rang me up but i got her name off the receipt and just had to contact her 
 two hours after i sent the message she called me and told me to turn the option off 
 i recently discovered this sub and i am hooked 
 i love all the good and even bad stories because i just laugh at how crazy people are 
 here 's one of my own 
 i worked as a cashier at a grocery store and for the most part enjoyed it 
 people made small talk and were typically polite 
 i knew most of the regulars by name 
 there was one asian lady who came in quite frequently with her husband who was in a wheelchair 
 he seemed like a <unk> and she was a bit eccentric - probably 40 's pink hair hello kitty stuff they were an interesting couple but always seemed to get along 
 i mentioned she was asian because sometimes he would have to <unk> what she was saying or correct her english a bit 
 well one day she comes in and buys a ton of the <unk> on sale 
 i asked her what it was all for and really only understood <unk> but she was excitedly saying something else 
 i could n't quite catch it smiled and nodded and sent her on her way 
 a few hours later she returns with her husband and a large to go box <unk> me out and really excitedly hands me the box 
 i was pretty confused and her husband explained that she really wanted me to try her amazing dumplings because i was so nice to her all the time 
 well they were amazing and pretty much every time i saw her after that she had a small container of dumplings just for me 
 she always managed to catch me before a break or lunch which was awesome 
 she was really sad when i told her i was moving on to a new job after about a year and she made sure to bring me some extra dumplings the last time she saw me 
 edit : i 'm glad you all seem to really enjoy this story : i 'll have a few more to come but they 'll be the crazy type 
 i am a customer service manager at a small <unk> owned grocery store and i was on phone duty which involves <unk> calls to other departments and taking orders for cafe and catering 
 a woman called and said she needed to make a change to one of her orders 
 me : ** '' yes ma'am that would be no problem 
 may i have the name on the order and the date for which it was placed '' ** her : * '' my name is suzy q. but his name is <unk> 
 he <unk> in the bahamas 
 they just found his body so it will take a week 
 they said they might have to freeze it to make it last that long can ya 'll do that 
 * me : ** '' ma'am we do n't do that here '' ** her : * '' but i called yesterday and they said they could freeze it for transportation 
 how is it going to last a week until the funeral if it 's not frozen 
 it will start to stink and his mother will be upset 
 * me : ** '' ma'am this is a grocery store you realize that right 
 we do n't transport bodies 
 ** her : * '' i was talking about the lasagna and you are being very rude and insensitive 
 do they teach you all customer service 
 can you pack it to freeze or not 
 * me : ** '' yes ma'am that wo n't be a problem 
 ** she then hung up the phone promptly 
 my superior was standing there listening to the whole conversation and when i explained the whole thing to him he laughed 
 lesson to be learned : specify what you are talking about 
 lasagna or bodies 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven 
 i 've posted a few other stories here if you 're interested 
 **story : ** a guy came in to pick up some fireworks 
 he was having a party and wanted to put on an impressive show for his friends 
 i spent about 20 minutes walking him through the store explaining the different items to him and showing him videos of the stuff to help him pick out exactly what he wanted 
 he mentioned a couple of times how he usually goes to & lt other store & gt and how their prices were cheaper 
 each time i’d apologized but i let him know that our prices were usually less than <unk> and that i thought that we had beat them on each of the items in question 
 the third time it happened i walked to our counter and grabbed the new catalog from & lt other store & gt 
 i found the stuff he had mentioned and showed him how we were in fact cheaper on every item that he had selected and that’s why i keep <unk> from my competitors on the counter 
 in fact on a couple of items we were about half of & lt other store & gt price 
 amazingly he didn’t seem happy about it but he kept shopping 
 by the time he was ready to check out he had a rolling flat cart full of stuff 
 it was mostly large <unk> packages finale cakes and big mortar kits with a few smaller items here and there 
 to speed things up and prevent us from having to unload all the big kits onto the counter i started calling out the prices for the bigger items to the cashier my dad 
 about halfway through i got to one of the largest items a massive mortar kit and called out the price of $ 199.95 
 when my dad was ringing it in the register display looked like it had screwed up so i stopped him and went to check it out 
 sure enough the item had rung in at $ 19.95 
 while i’m talking to my dad about it the customer walks over and demands to see the mistake 
 i show him that the last entry was for $ 19.95 instead of $ 199.95 
 he immediately tells me that i have to sell the item to him at the price that rang up 
 i showed him that the item itself had the correct price tag on it and that the cashier had just <unk> it when he had rung it in 
 the guy gets agitated and repeatedly starts telling me that i have to legally sell the thing to him at that price since the cashier had rung it in like that 
 i calmly explained that if the item had been priced wrong i would sell it to him at the incorrect price but since it was just a <unk> we would just void the last item rung in and do it again 
 now <unk> lawyer guy alg starts yelling that he knows his rights and that i’m breaking the law if i have the cashier change the price and i don’t sell it to him at the wrong price 
 now i’ve had the staff screw up before when doing pricing and if we put the wrong lower price tag on something that’s what i’m going to sell it to you for 
 i also know that unless it’s an <unk> price i don’t <unk> have to do it but if i screwed up i’m going to eat that mistake and <unk> the item after we’re done 
 side note to josh c. - happy birthday today 
 and next time pay attention to the damn price list when you’re using the price gun because i know most of these <unk> have your name on them 
 also go back to school and don’t do drugs 
 me : are you telling me that legally even if we screwed up i can’t have the cashier fix a mistake and that i have to sell you the item at whatever price was keyed into the register 
 alg : yes 
 me : looking at my dad i guess we’re going to have to charge him whatever you keyed in 
 i calmly walked back around the counter and picked up another item from his cart a small fountain with a price tag of $ <unk> and continued calling out the prices 
 when we were all done my dad gave him the total 
 alg : that can’t be right 
 that’s way too much 
 there’s no way i got that much stuff 
 dad : oops 
 looks like the fountain rang in for $ <unk> 
 did you want to pay that in cash or with a credit card 
 alg just glared at my dad for a few seconds then quietly asked if we could fix it 
 we happily fixed both mistakes <unk> up his items and sent him on his way with a smile 
 hey tfr people 
 so for background i work at a kiosk in a mall where i repair cracked phones and do other mind <unk> work that i can now probably do in my sleep 
 i 've been doing this job for a little over two years and can fix an iphone for example in about 15 minutes 
 i apologize for the wall of text 
 anyway this story happened last night 
 so a family of three walk up mother father and daughter but only the father spoke to me and this is where conversation starts 
 note : when i was handed this girls phone she had a case with this image on it and was already about to laugh 
 customer will be <unk> and i of course will be **me** 
 **c : ** how much does it cost to fix my daughters phone and can it be fixed 
 **me : ** oh it 's very <unk> after tax and labor it comes to $ xxx.xx 
 **c : ** do it *fuck he 's one of these guys ... * **me : ** alright then i just need a name and signature on this <unk> we have 
 at this point i 've taken their phone and am prepping to work on it 
 **c : ** do i have to use my real name 
 <unk> now over the <unk> years i 've worked here i have never heard this question 
 so i was kind of taken by surprise by it 
 for a minute i thought he was one of those paranoid people 
 *play* **me : ** um.. well i guess you do n't have to 
 it 's preferred since we can look you up in our system faster later 
 **c : ** oh ok. i turn back around and start to use my tools on the phone when customer guy throws me another <unk> ball question 
 **c : ** can my daughter play the <unk> when this is done 
 i manage to turn and see him smirking a little and go back to his serious poker face so i pick up that he 's joking 
 **me : ** well i would hope so 
 *slight laughter* **c : ** oh ok great 
 she 's never even touched one before so it 's good to hear her skill wo n't change in the slightest 
 i 'm on the verge of outright laughing at this point 
 i manage to hold it back and finish my repair 
 i snap her grumpy cat case back on hand her phone back but then she mentions the home button is n't working 
 *oh that 's an easy <unk> **me : ** ah do n't worry 
 give me one second and i 'll have that fixed 
 **c : ** one 
 try it now insert girls name '' **me : ** haha well i have n't done what i need to yet 
 i pull out a giant clear bag half full of spare parts 
 **c : ** holy shit man 
 i burst out laughing at this point 
 i take what i need and fix her home button 
 afterwards i just ask for a signature to confirm they are satisfied with the repair and that they picked up their phone 
 while he does this it 's taking an oddly long time to just sign his name i tell him how much it 'll be again take the paperwork from him so i can do the usual have a good night mr. so and so '' 
 i briefly glance at the document so i can catch his last name 
 he 's already handing me the cash by now and this is where i lost it 
 **me : ** alright that 'll be $ xxx.xx 
 thank you and you have a good night mr. duck 
 i 'm looking at this man dead in the eyes at this moment when my voice <unk> off as i finished my sentence 
 i look back at the paper to make sure i read it right 
 lo and behold there it was.. donald duck '' 
 he had tried to sign as donald duck before messed up scribbled it out and wrote thank you '' 
 instead 
 i 'm so close to laughing 
 i can feel it building up but i have to play on this 
 **me : ** sir i 'm going to have to hold you here while i call mall security 
 <unk> taken aback by <unk> **c : ** what 
 why 
 **me : ** sir i 've met donald duck 
 he 's a giant duck in a sailor type <unk> with no pants 
 he works and lives in florida 
 you are no donald duck 
 i have reason to believe you have stolen his identity 
 *i 'm holding back so much right now because i want to make it seem serious 
 * **c : ** fuck 
 he 's onto us 
 i fucking lost it when he said that 
 the daughter is facepalming the mother is just standing there with a what the fuck '' 
 look on her face as the father <unk> ass out of there and rounds the nearest corner 
 i 'm nearly on the floor laughing by now 
 i still have n't rung them up at this point and when i calm down i look at the wife 
 **me : ** i 've never laughed so hard in the entire time i 've worked here 
 i 'm discounting this sale by $ 35 this is the most i can take off 
 some of it being the labor fee that gives me commission 
 y'all are the best customers i 've ever had 
 she thanks me starts laughing and takes her still facepalming daughter with her 
 **tl dr** had a customer who stole donald <unk> identity 
 edit : alright alright 
 i 'll <unk> this to <unk> edit 2 : words 
 edit 3 : holy shit quote of the day 
 thanks for reading everyone a couple years ago when the ps4 and xbox one came out i was working in the electronics department of a big box store 
 naturally it being early december and the consoles being brand new we were sold out and orders to get more in were backed up due to high demand 
 so i come into work for 7am an hour before the doors open and there is a lady waiting in her <unk> stay warm before the store to open no big deal happens a lot this time of year 
 at 8 we open the doors and she <unk> for my department 
 before i can even say hi she demands the ps4 we have in stock 
 now i had just checked inventory as part of my routine and knew we did n't receive any so we were still out of stock with an undefined '' under estimated delivery meaning our <unk> did n't know when nor have any either 
 i apologize to her and inform her of the situation but she is having none of it 
 she tells me she phoned last night and was told we were going to be getting one first thing in the morning 
 which is strange because i was the only one who was in the previous night when she said she called 
 realizing that she was going to start to cause trouble i suggested she try other stores in the area as they might have some in stock 
 then she blows up at me insulting me and demanding to speak with my manager 
 unfortunately for her i was the manager for my department and upon being informed of this she did n't know what to say for a minute 
 after a few seconds of silence she started the customer is always right speech and demanded that i sell her our display ps4 for a 75 % discount because of the inconvenience i caused her and the use it had already received 
 but i could n't sell the display and when i told her that she started calling me a liar saying i was planning on buying it myself no thanks i like pc 
 at that point i asked her if there was anything else she was looking for that i could help her with 
 she then decided to channel her inner kid and just repeatedly say ps4 over and over 
 i laughed in her face at how immature she was being and said well if you 're trying to do a better <unk> of a four year old we have some huggies just a few aisles down over there '' 
 i then went to the back room warehouse to continue my duties and when i came back 5 minutes later she was gone and i never saw her again 
 back in october <unk> nickelback was burning up the <unk> with their angsty canadian rock and their latest cd was the top seller at our music store for months 
 one morning 20 minutes before opening the store i noticed a woman <unk> outside the door with that nickelback cd and a receipt in hand 
 once 10am rolled around i unlocked and opened the door for her and before i could say anything ... her : one of your employees sold me a bad cd last night 
 it does n't play at all 
 not in my car not in my computer not in my cd player 
 it just says error 
 give me another one '' 
 because she had her receipt from the night before i had no problem <unk> her faulty cd for another copy 
 we had tons in stock so i grabbed a new one for her and threw the bad one into our <unk> '' box 
 before she left i opened the cellophane for her and checked that the disk was in good shape and she ran out to her car 
 not 30 seconds later she comes back into the store on the verge of tears 
 her : this cd does n't work either 
 same thing : error 
 what kind of mean joke are you trying to pull 
 are you making fun of me for liking nickelback '' 
 me : no ma'am ... uh ... nickelback is awesome 
 maybe it was a defective batch of cds from the distributor 
 let me try it in our store player to see if i get the same error '' 
 i checked the cd ... it did not have any <unk> or fingerprints so i popped it into our player 
 a few seconds later the generic rock sounds of nickelback played throughout the store 
 the woman was shocked 
 her : i ca n't believe it 
 how did you get it to work 
 i tried everything 
 i even followed the instructions on the cover and put it into the player silver side up edit : thanks for the gold 
 and yeah i know this sounds like an <unk> dad joke but it really happened 
 if you worked in this store back in the early <unk> you 'd <unk> i had discovered that some enterprising person had replicated staff check seals little stickers put on staff purchases by a manager type as proof of purchase and was selling them online 
 part of me loved the enterprising nature of whoever this was selling stickers <unk> novelty use only 
 i thought id do the right thing and i emailed the link to the auction to the store manager 
 got a reply thanking me and it would be sent of yada yada ... each time i was on the online auction site say weekly id check and they continued to be sold 
 one day i was in the staff room eating lunch the loss prevention manager for the chain came and sat opposite we 'd run into each other before so we were chatting a little bit 
 anyway having a chat and he asks me 'what would you do to help with loss prevention 
 so i told them about the <unk> 
 to say he lost it is an understatement 
 he released me from store duties we went into the office and had a <unk> with all sorts of people about it 
 we then went to the police station filed a police report and did as much research on the seller buyers who bought the stuff etc back before the online auction locked everything down all of which took the whole day 
 i was told not to say anything to anyone 
 to be honest i largely forgot about it 
 a month or so later i was <unk> to head office interstate 
 it turns out that the seller was an asm from a store interstate and every buyer the police tracked was an employee 
 the asm sold at least 500 <unk> of 1000 stickers 
 i was given a <unk> for a day type of few days a cash bonus 5 star hotel promise of a reference in the future etc 
 i obviously knew why but they kept <unk> about the details 
 only at the end of the few days i was told that the catch was likely to save the company in excess of $ <unk> 
 this was when i was still reasonably new to the workforce i felt like a million bucks 
 at a time when i was n't sure what to do with my life i was on the <unk> of some serious <unk> 
 i went back into my store and you know what 
 nothing 
 <unk> knew a thing 
 i could not <unk> it at all everyone was under the impression i was on leave 
 a couple of weeks later the sm asked while i was filling drinks 'oh i never followed your email up are they still selling 
 talk about coming back down to earth : <unk> found out that you do n't even need to be working retail to get the brunt of some rude customers 
 i went to a school whose name is similar to a large craft store chain 
 we 'll just say the store started with a.c. something and my school 's name started with <unk> 
 i was home from break and working at a local <unk> store 
 after work one day i decided i needed some brushes and a.c. something was on the way 
 so i 'm wearing my work uniform from my sandwich store its just a polo shirt 
 i 'm also wearing a lanyard that is plastered with my school 's name and attached are my keys and my student id which is also plastered with my school 's name 
 i 'm in the <unk> section which is next to the fake flowers when an elderly lady does n't just tap but grabs my arm 
 lady : you are there any more tulips 
 me : uh i 'm sorry 
 lady : where are the rest of the tulips 
 me : sorry i do n't know 
 i do n't work here 
 lady 
 do n't lie to me it says you do right here 
 the woman points to my lanyard and school id 
 me : oh no 
 that 's where i go to school 
 laughing lady : do n't laugh at me goddamn lazy employees 
 i 'm going to go get your manager and you 'll see who is laughing now 
 she walks away and i go back to looking at paint 
 about three minutes later i hear the shrill voice of the old lady again 
 lady : there she is 
 that 's the girl 
 what i assume to be the asst 
 manager looks pissed 
 asst manager : i 'm writing you up and you are going to help this woman 
 me : i 'm sorry 
 asst manager : if you do n't help this woman i 'm writing you up twice 
 me : i do n't work here 
 asst : okay if that 's what you want consider yourself fired 
 the old lady has a smug look on her face 
 right then though what i assume to be the manager appears and asks the asst manager what happened 
 asst : she refuses to help this woman 
 the manager looks pissed as well but when he walks up to me his face drops and he looks amused 
 manager : you do n't work here 
 me : nope 
 lady : she 's a bad employee 
 manager : she is not an employee m'am she does n't work here 
 lady : because you fired her 
 manager : no because she never worked here 
 the manager then tells the old woman that he can not have customers harassing other customers and he tells her to leave 
 he profusely apologizes to me the woman turns bright purple and slinks away 
 i get a 10 % off coupon and the manager tells the asst 
 manager to meet him in the back office 
 i still have no idea how the asst 
 thought i worked there 
 i 'm guessing he just had no clue who was working there 
 obviously now i always remember not to wear that lanyard and to stuff it in my bag before shopping there 
 i work in a catalogue store in the uk in which part of our job involves bringing items out from the stockroom to a collection desk where customers then pick them up 
 as part of our customer service with anything remotely <unk> the colleague handing over the item will ask the customer if they would like a hand carrying it out to their car 
 necessary context for this story : i 'm female 22 about 5 '' 1 and incredibly skinny 
 so i 'm working in the stockroom and bring out a box of <unk> furniture <unk> <unk> if i remember correctly boxes are labelled with weight 
 <unk> to me but i can lift more 
 i dump it down on the desk while my colleague marks off the customers receipt and gives the standard do you need any help carrying that '' query 
 the customer labelled pc for <unk> customer laughs and responds with this right in from of me : & gt pc : oh if that little girl can carry it i 'm sure it 's not too heavy 
 she could n't lift it.so yesterday was the first real summer day in my part of the world 
 it 's boiling hot glorious sunshine all we 're selling is <unk> and burgers 
 we all know those days where all you hear is oh it 's lovely out sucks to be you '' 
 yeah do n't i bloody know it 
 enter charming black man <unk> for the pc among you note : i 'm a <unk> white girl hey girl are you having a good day '' 
 not with that weather out there sir '' 
 <unk> <unk> damn right you should be out in that sun <unk> <unk> i was the same colour as you this morning '' 
 ladies and gentlemen *that* is how you make someone 's <unk> tfr 
 this tale happened yesterday at my job in a uk technology shop 
 i was covering my co-worker as greeter a man comes into the shop and made a beeline for me 
 i greet him and prepare myself for any problems he may have 
 him : what are these 
 i find myself holding a small sandwich bag the insides stained black with printer ink 
 in the bowels of the bag are two cartridges 
 i examine them trying to see if i can find a product code or identifying mark 
 all it has is a list of <unk> printers it 's <unk> with 
 i think these are a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> '' well then go fetch them 
 good girl '' 
 i freeze for a second as he 's expecting me to run across half of our quite large store to fetch these for him as he 's too entitled to do it himself 
 all i can manage is a sorry i 'm staying here '' 
 and point him in the direction of our printing section 
 stop trying to make <unk> happen it 's not going to happen 
 yesterday was a really cold day 
 temps dropped below freezing after a very <unk> and warm couple of weeks 
 this usually means we have to deal with tons of battery purchases and installations 
 we were not disappointed 
 usually people want cheap batteries except some people want batteries that are not made for there car 
 we carry a low power battery it might have the power to make a geo metro turn over but thats about it 
 this guy comes in and sees the cheap battery and he wants the battery 
 i ask him year make model of vehicle 
 he tells me it is a <unk> model <unk> pickup 
 i tell him the battery does not have the power to turn over the truck and this is usually where the problems <unk> 
 people do not like being told there vehicle takes a bigger more expensive battery we carry 3 tiers of batteries in most sizes 
 a <unk> which you use to sell the car a mid grade which has a little power but a good cold snap will kill them and the expensive one which has more than enough power to <unk> a herd of <unk> 
 prices vary <unk> on the size and power 
 the man asks how do you know it wo n't work 
 i told him the minimum cold crank amps for his truck and pointed out the cheap battery was a good 400 amps lower than that 
 he nods and goes alright 
 he goes off and grabs the one we recommend 
 my co-worker looks at me and goes what the <unk> just happened 
 were so used to people arguing with us it threw us off 
 so i 've been at my store for about 3 hours and just finished my 3 training classes android 101 <unk> <unk> 
 not that stressful but definitely <unk> 85 % of my daily <unk> of patience there was supposed to just be one class at 1pm ... long story 
 anyway a man approaches me with his wife and a young child 
 hands me a dinosaur and says his cell phone carrier told him i could save his phone 
 he had it in his pocket when it rained 
 it was stuck on a certain screen and they hoped i could reinstall android 
 i may have been able to but his phone was way too old and the official software was n't available 
 he then asked if i could transfer things around and move him into an existing phone his daughter 's iphone 
 i said yes 
 he then asked if he would lose anything on the phone 
 she had just passed away 8 months to the day 
 i could see the pain behind his eyes and his wife 's eyes were even more telling 
 i told him we would take care of it 
 at that moment i 'd do anything we had to <unk> past the lock screen with <unk> force by way of playing 20 questions 
 finally we got in 
 now the apple id password 
 rinse repeat 20 questions and we eventually got it the mother had a very close relationship with her daughter 
 then we went to download google drive to host the files ... phone required to update to new version 
 hell no 
 so we tried to use a back up from itunes and special software to transfer the data 
 no dice 
 we then tried to use a special machine to transfer the data to my phone 
 no dice both of these things are not supposed to fail 
 finally we realized that my <unk> phone was the cause 
 so i pulled a demo phone from my table and used it 
 once we had that we the employees of the store purchased a special usb that had <unk> and full size usb on it 
 we transferred the data there and created a cloud based account to host the files 
 we handed him the usb and moved the phone numbers to the working devices 
 i lost a few <unk> to sell my products that day four hours about 
 but i won a customer for life yesterday and anyone he tells the story to will probably feel the same way 
 after spending hours with him and learning about how his wife <unk> his daughter for two years until her death fuck cancer 
 their daughter suffering while pregnant when they discovered it 
 the poor child granddaughter playing with my kids tablet and the deep set pain in her eyes 
 she got a balloon and two gummy bears the size of your fist from my bribery stash 
 it made me feel emotions that you try to avoid ... but right now ... i have an enormous sense of <unk> 
 tl dr - we did a good thing reddit 
 try and find an opportunity for yourselves 
 the interactions are n't all bad 
 edit : i 'm absolutely flattered right now 
 but i 'm also exhausted 
 they were back today 
 the little girl pointed at a picture of a sunset and said to me that is where mommy is ... in heaven 
 there is more but i need time to process this 
 soon as i get today <unk> from my eyeballs i 'll add to the story 
 also thank you so very much for the gold 
 just give me a bit to <unk> 
 see you all very soon you <unk> people 
 edit : so they came back to see if we could <unk> his the grandfather 's original phone to save his contacts 
 i didnt think we could without fixing the <unk> 
 so we tried to find a the stock version of android that goes with his phone 
 could n't find anything but custom software that other people had made 
 problem was it would wipe the phone if we installed it 
 not helping 
 but it got me thinking 
 why do n't we just do that 
 then <unk> the device and use something to recover the files 
 even though they would have been <unk> 
 too <unk> 
 so instead we basically gave the phone cpr 
 we kept forcing a <unk> until ... magically we saw a <unk> screen 
 i wish i could have released balloons from the ceiling 
 during the process i got to share this post with the family 
 the mother began to cry a little 
 the granddaughter actually was doing her best to cheer me up 
 she was earily okay with mom being healed now '' 
 i was in awe of her 
 the whole ordeal i will remember for a good long while 
 i want to mention that without the help and support of the other staff 
 i doubt this would have turned out the way it did 
 thanks guys 
 you bet your sweet buns i told them reddit 
 like a lot 
 a couple of years ago i worked at an office supplies store as a cashier 
 i was doing this to earn a little income while working on my bachelor 's degree and plus i liked the job and the people i worked with 
 the worst time for our store was during back - to - school '' a time when everyone one came in during the tax free weekend to buy school supplies for their special snowflakes 
 it was crazy busy so we had everyone working that day and manning the registers including my managers 
 this one <unk> woman with <unk> blonde hair carrying a designer purse came up to the register and threw her stuff down on the counter 
 she then proceeded to toss her coupons at me and told me to run 'em '' 
 i smiled through gritted teeth and asked if she found everything okay 
 she proceeded to completely ignore me and text on her phone while her <unk> year old daughter stood quietly next to her 
 i scanned the items and then scanned the coupons 
 my computer informed me that one of the coupons was expired so i took a look at it and saw that it had expired a year ago 
 there 's no way i 'd be able to override that 
 i politely informed her that i would be unable to apply that particular coupon to her purchase as it was expired 
 she huffed 
 but why 
 it 's a coupon and you guys should take any coupons that the customer gives you '' 
 i repeated myself and told her that the items on the coupon did n't even match the items in her purchase and she was visibly agitated at this point 
 let me speak to your manager i do n't have time for this crap '' 
 ooookay 
 i motioned for my manager to come to my register from where he was standing close by and while he was on his way the lady leaned down to her daughter and said in a sickeningly sweet voice : see honey 
 this is why you go to college and get an education so you do n't have to end up like her working as a cashier '' 
 holy 
 fuck 
 what did she just say 
 my face turned bright red and the tears starting forming in my eyes as i muttered to her that i was in fact going to college and that this was a part time job 
 at that moment my manager showed up behind me and asked the lady to repeat herself which she stupidly did 
 she had a smug look on her face as she explained that she was the customer and the customer is always right and that she just needed this coupon to be applied 
 i wanted to punch her in the face 
 my manager stood there and looked at her for a few seconds and then began taking all of her already bagged items out of their bags 
 what the hell are you doing '' 
 the witch screeched 
 slowly and calmly my manager said : ma'am i will not let you stand here and <unk> and abuse my employees 
 i am going to have to ask you to leave 
 we no longer wish to do business with you '' 
 she stared at us wide-eyed and red in the face and then looked behind her to see a long line of customers all looking back at her 
 she sputtered 
 she cried 
 she threw a tantrum 
 her young daughter behaved better than this <unk> woman 
 it was insane 
 she took her purse and her cards grabbed her daughters hand and stormed out while screaming i am never coming back here again 
 i am going to call your boss and have you all fired 
 do you know who i am '' 
 my manager chuckled and then told me that i could go take a breather in the back because at that point i probably looked like i had seen a ghost 
 and that 's how i learned to stop caring about what customers thought of me or what rude things they said to me <unk> why do you hate me so 
 : so after several months of <unk> training i 've finally been given a position as duty manager in my restaurant 
 so far it 's nothing too special but it has its perks 
 from day one i promised myself i was n't going to act like the rest of the managers in the store oh my staff did n't lick your boots for you 
 i 'm so sorry i 'll put them on disciplinary right away and here 's a free meal 
 sure that 's the easy way to do things but my duty is to support my team and if they 're happy then so am i. i know the pain and having worked under that sort of nonsense for a year and a half i decided that enough was enough 
 cue a delightful middle-aged gentleman about halfway through a busy shift that also happened to be my first shift run as a supervisor 
 i noticed one of the front counter staff trying desperately to explain something to a customer but to no avail 
 i could tell immediately he had no point to make whatsoever and just wanted to cause trouble for whatever reason 
 at that point i decided to step in 
 & gt me : sorry is everything okay with your food 
 & gt customer : no it 's not 
 i ordered chicken and i got a leg 
 & gt me : so you did n't want the leg piece 
 & gt customer : no i wanted a breast piece 
 why did n't i get that 
 & gt me : sorry about that did you let the cashier know that you had a preference 
 & gt customer : no 
 why should i 
 happy place 
 happy place 
 happy place 
 & gt me : sorry sir i 'm happy to change it for you this time but in the future if you just let the cashier know you have a preference then we 'll do our best to accommodate that for you 
 bearing in mind he 'd already picked up the piece of chicken and waved it in our faces meaning that i 'd have to throw it away and get chewed out by the general manager for wasting product i wrongly assumed i was being reasonably helpful 
 & gt customer : are you able to read 
 oh dear 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry 
 & gt customer : are any of you able to read 
 what does the menu say 
 i decided to ignore the fact that the item he had ordered was n't actually specifically listed on the menu boards the item he had ordered has 4 different variations and they were all listed under one name 
 & gt me : with this you get a piece of chicken and fries 
 & gt customer : so why did i get a leg instead 
 i politely explained to the customer that the chicken is selected more or less at random but that if you have a preference then we 're more than happy to try and accommodate it 
 that 's what was coming out of my mouth but in my mind all i could think was a chicken leg *is* a <unk> piece of chicken 
 & gt customer : your staff should have asked me what i want 
 there is more than one type of snack box right 
 & gt me : yes there is it comes with either a piece of chicken a <unk> piece hot wings or popcorn chicken 
 the cashier would have asked you which one you wanted and you ordered the one piece snack box 
 is that right 
 & gt customer : yes but she did n't ask me if i wanted it to be a breast 
 it 's not my fault if your staff ca n't even do such a simple job properly 
 no 
 no you do not accuse my staff of being unable to do their jobs simply because you are a self important idiot who ca n't even order fast food properly 
 i know my staff well and i know that every single one of them is excellent at their job 
 if you want a custom item you do n't expect the cashier to already know about it 
 you would n't go to order a burger and expect to be immediately asked if you wanted to take out the mayonnaise 
 but he was n't finished 
 & gt customer : you need to make your staff ask people what they want and you need to change the menu boards so people actually know what they are ordering 
 this is ridiculous this is just to make sure that first time buyers waste their money 
 your staff obviously do n't know how to treat people they should n't even be working here i am disgusted and i 'm going to write complaints about every one of them which i expect you to deal with *appropriately* 
 **no <unk> 
 this man was about to receive over a year 's worth of <unk> up customer service rage and i almost felt sorry for him 
 & gt me : sir my team are doing their jobs perfectly and i have complete faith that they will continue to do so 
 you wanted a <unk> item but did n't specifically ask for it 
 you are now being <unk> rude to the staff and trying to make them feel uncomfortable to cover up your own error and i will not put up with it 
 you asked for a piece of chicken and you received a piece of chicken 
 as far as i am concerned you are just trying to cause trouble and so i would like to ask you to take your food that i have already changed for you and leave the counter immediately 
 i am done speaking with you and so are my team 
 he stood there dumbfounded for a few seconds realised it was hopeless and promptly stormed off 
 even more shocked were the front counter staff who based on previous experience with managers taking idiotic customer complaints had almost certainly been expecting to be yelled at for this 
 i think i earned their respect that day and i think they finally realised that someone with a manager badge is on their side 
 the rest of the day was great and the team all seemed to work twice as hard as usual 
 this is still all very new for me and i have a lot of <unk> as to whether i will be a good manager or not but the one thing i do n't doubt in the slightest is that i will stand up for my team every time 
 my <unk> may have changed but i am not going to stop fighting the good fight 
 edit : wow 
 my first gold 
 thank you so much 
 : <unk> : wow 
 <unk> 
 this really blew up on reddit 
 thanks all 
 *i 've re-written the story a bit to clarify some misconceptions 
 this story is told from the perspective of a <unk> inexperienced spineless angry kid who was having a bad day 11 years ago 
 there are a lot of events that took place that could have been avoided but then this story would n't have happened or happened very differently 
 hindsight is 20/20 and i 'm no longer the angry person i described above 
 just relax and cringe along with the rest of the world as you read this 
 * = **this is an extremely long/involved story if you skim or skip sections you 'll miss out on details or colorful descriptions 
 ** **all of it is 100 % true and happened 11 years ago 
 ** its <unk> april 26th <unk> i was a part time limo driver working mostly on weekends to pay off my student <unk> 
 this particular saturday morning i slept through my alarm and completely missed my airport drop off for a <unk> corporate client 
 my day was starting off really bad but little did i know it would turn out to be one of the worst days of my life 
 in fact i’ve yet to have one that even comes close to topping it 
 i’m going to tell it in as humorous way possible because if you can’t laugh at your own misfortune who can you laugh at 
 <unk> the <unk> <unk> - i really messed up by sleeping through my alarm so i arrived hours late to work hoping for the boss to give me another run 
 i am without a shower and soon discovered my top button of my new dress shirt came off 
 add more <unk> to an already sour mood 
 **8 out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale <unk> - boss proceeds to yell and scream at me for 20 minutes on how this was one of his best corporate accounts we might lose it yadda yadda 
 he is normally reasonable but he was having an equally bad day and blaming me for stuff i had n't even done or was close to being part of 
 since he 's so pissed i just let him vent because i deserved it 
 slide back to a **6 out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale but 10 out of 10 on the guilty and charged '' scale <unk> – the boss makes me clean out several limos for no pay we get paid driving limos cleaning is not driving so no pay and only <unk> at giving me another run possibly a wedding 
 i know the only wedding left for the day is a <unk> pickup in the middle of downtown la 1 hour and 10 minute drive due to traffic 
 no way would he give that to me with less than an hour and 20 minutes 
 sure enough the boss still royally pissed at me gives me the worst driver opinion limo on the lot as punishment and i still have to clean up and get it ready to take customers 
 he tells me *you better not be fucking late for this ... * '' and sends me on my way at <unk> 
 i do n't even get a chance to look at the details 
 i think *i 'll do so when i get <unk> 
 <unk> - i arrive at downtown la hotel to pick up groom and groomsmen and take to ucla campus church 
 note : i 'm 5 minutes late cause of traffic 
 i 'm <unk> but attempt to make the best of the situation <unk> out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale from here there is traffic the entire way to the church near the ucla campus across town because it’s # @ % $ 
 <unk> and the surface streets are packed because of some event 
 i pull up at <unk> for a 1:30pm wedding 
 <unk> 
 made it with time to <unk> 
 for those not near la this trip should have taken <unk> *edit : closer to 30 didthemath* minutes 
 when i pull up to the church i get greeted by an irate wedding coordinator aka sneakywc and father of the bride fotb because i 'm late 
 what the hell 
 i’m trying to explain how “*traffic*” works but she is hearing none of it and the father is screaming at me 
 while we are talking i have the fotb sign the contract and credit card receipt and i 'm wondering why she is so hell bent on me being late when i’ve got <unk> to spare 
 i 've barely had a chance to check the runsheet other than names and <unk> but upon a quick <unk> my scribbled mess of a runsheet says i’m to <unk> at the church for the wedding to end then to take them to the restaurant for dinner* 
 then the wedding coordinator finally drops the bomb on me 
 * <unk> have to go pick up the bride and <unk> as well 
 the ceremony starts at 1:30pm 
 <unk> * what 
 hold on a minute no i 'm not 
 it’s not on the <unk> 
 i 'm pretty sure i 'm not supposed to pick them up 
 * *yes you are 
 hurry because they are in <unk> '' that’s back in downtown la now i know that i ca n't leave to do anything unless it 's on the runsheet 
 hiring a limo means everything is planned out ahead of time 
 a surprise pickup and drop-off point especially for a wedding is practically unheard of and i have never heard of this happening 
 in essence what the fotb and the wedding coordinator are asking me is to add an additional stop on the run 
 this will make everyone and everything late 
 if i was supposed to pick up the bride all along why was n't this mentioned ahead of time and jotted down on the runsheet 
 the boss would have allotted more time for this 
 did the client mess up 
 did the boss 
 what the heck 
 * <unk> we need to hurry 
 help me attach this traditional chinese bow to the front of the limo 
 * '' time out hold the phone ... we have two red flags and now a red bow here 
 first we have two unscheduled pickup and drop off points and second nobody ever messes with the bosses limos ever 
 that 's practically rule # 1 
 i glance over the chicken scratch of a scribbled mess that is my bosses <unk> and i notice two words half way crossed out ~~chinese bow~~ '' edit : i 'm thinking maybe the boss changed his mind maybe he forgot to tell me about this bow due to his fit of rage earlier 
 my <unk> said i should have called my boss 
 but ... as he was already ticked off and i 'm <unk> late* to pick up the bride from an unscheduled pickup best if i left him alone 
 he 's just going to say *well its a wedding after all 
 go pick them up * '' 
 * look my boss does n't like anyone <unk> anything to the limo 
 * *i 've already talked with him about this 
 we do n't have time 
 here pop the hood 
 * '' well i guess that 's true the bow was mentioned in the runsheet 
 i do n't want to give my boss any more reason to <unk> me for pissing off a client so she herself pops the hood of my limo 
 she then proceeds to tie down this bow as i 'm distracted by an irate fotb who freaking out wondering why it took 50 minutes to get from downtown la to ucla 
 quick answer ... limousine 's take longer 
 after sneakywc is finished it looks a little something like this only the ribbons are attached under the hood not through the doors like in the photo 
 she 's obviously done this before so i leave her to do all the work 
 within a few minutes everything is done and the red bow is tied down firmly to the front of the hood 
 on the trip back to downtown la i noticed the bow is very loose but due to time <unk> i do n't have time to fix it 
 <unk> - no traffic on the way back thank god 
 and i arrive at the unscheduled stop to pick up the brides party with the mom and grandmother 
 all who are chinese and hardly speak a lick of english 
 obviously we are going to be late but i 'm doing my best to speed things up given the circumstances 
 i know from previous experience that the 10 freeway is <unk> packed near the <unk> so i exit to surface streets at la <unk> then jump to <unk> and then to sunset blvd it 's a driver thing 
 pick <unk> with less stop signs and traffic lights 
 <unk> - we are on sunset blvd heading west at this point making good time but the arms of this bow are flapping like a <unk> waving <unk> tubeman ... in a hurricane 
 three things happen all at the same time 
 the traditional chinese bow breaks loose from the front of the car and whips <unk> the windshield but still attached at the arms near the <unk> 
 the two 'arm ribbons are hanging on for dear life in the wind and semi blocking my view through the glass 
 within seconds the two ribbons rip from under the hood and <unk> all power goes out** in the back of the limo 
 it 's a complete <unk> 
 the chinese bow goes sailing into the air and over the vehicle to land in a crumpled heap 
 i 'm left stunned saying to myself * ... <unk> the <unk> ... 
 * '' the old <unk> in the back scream bloody murder in chinese 
 i instantly start to <unk> <unk> '' 
 right along with them 
 *hey 
 they surprised me ok 
 * through the chaotic <unk> that is 6 chinese gals screaming i quickly gather that the bow is some sort of family heirloom and must be <unk> 
 they demand that i get the bow 
 i 'm to do it not them ... in the middle of traffic 
 remember the limo is stopped on the side of the street on <unk> where there is no shoulder to pull over 
 my limo is literally in the middle of the right lane of moving cars 
 i react by putting my hazards on and carefully open my door to cars <unk> by and <unk> blaring 
 i spot the ~~ % $ # @ & amp ~~ i mean *lovely wedding <unk> and witness it getting run over by a speeding <unk> the irony of the red target and the <unk> bull was a lost to me at the time 
 i hold out my hands out in the <unk> known language of *hey i 'm a crazy nutter* and proceed to <unk> <unk> traffic 
 i 'm playing a living version of <unk> through oncoming cars and finally get to this <unk> bow 
 i grab the damned thing and notice it has tire marks on the ribbons and parts of it have been shredded from passing cars 
 i angrily toss the thing in the front seat and proceed to get some major squawking from the back 
 now what 
 **9½ out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale * *no 
 you have to put the bow back on the car 
 chinese tradition 
 ca n't move without bow being on car 
 * '' well <unk> 
 so i pop the hood and head back out into traffic ... curse-ed bow in hand 
 cars are still honking as they pass and i ignore them 
 i get the front of the bow <unk> to the grill 
 as i lift the hood fully i notice a large severed cable near the windshield 
 sneakywc had attached the arms of the ribbons to a thick electrical wire instead of to the frame of the vehicle 
 the wires she used to had literally acted like a <unk> and sliced it clean through 
 this electrical wire was the power to the back of the limo 
 all lights stereo features and ... get this.. ac unit 
 they had no power at all and i had no way of fixing it right now 
 i finish tying off the bow to the frame hop back in drenched in sweat and start the car and wave politely to the passing cop 
 oh sure now you show up 
 thanks for nothing <unk> - arrive at the church 45mins late to the wedding from an unscheduled pick up that was <unk> up on me **10 out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale i 'm greeted by both the father of the bride and sneakywc 
 i have a few choice words for the wedding coordinator and the brides chinese father who ca n't believe how slow i 'm driving and wondering why i did n't speed to get there 
 they blamed me for everything that happened yes some of it was my fault some not 
 chewed me out about the neglected pickup the thing with the bow and the fact i arrived extremely late 
 2:30pm - the wedding starts <unk> delayed and i break out the box of limo tools and proceed to make some <unk> repairs the best i can 
 little did i know that this was only the start of bad things to come 
 **end of part 1** ** the chinese wedding { epic worst day } part 2 ** the chinese wedding { epic worst day } part 3 *edited the links from the short version to the full for android app <unk> so i was a 21 yr old shift manager at a pizza place and was upset that the only way to make more money was to become an assistant manager and be put on salary and work 50+ hours a week 
 one day my boss asked if i would interview a 16 year old girl for a position we had 
 she said she would hire her if i think they would do well 
 i sit down to interview the goth 
 imagine the girl with a dragon tattoo about <unk> <unk> and more face rings 
 she was wearing a uniform for the fast-food joint down the road 
 the conversation goes something like this 
 so i see your wearing a uniform 
 are you still working for them '' 
 no i just walked out because they were being dumb '' being dumb 
 what do you mean by that '' 
 they were being dumb because they were asking too many questions '' awkward pause ... well this is an interview and the purpose is to ask questions 
 so what makes you think you would be a good fit here at pizza place '' 
 well i like pizza '' after the interview i decided to hire this girl because she was entertaining and would be a good laugh when my boss had to work with her every day 
 my boss puts in the paper work and hires her without ever seeing her 
 the next day i come into work and my boss is fuming mad 
 the goth showed up with purple hair and more rings in her face 
 my boss told me to deal with it 
 so i go out and tell the goth she has to change 
 when asked why i tell her because she is scaring the customers away 
 the goth busted out laughing 
 she actually went home and changed 
 we put her on prep work in the back to keep her away from people because we quickly found out there was no filter from her brain to her mouth 
 a month goes by and i notice cuts on her arm she always wore long sleeve shirts 
 i asked her about it and she acted like it was no big deal 
 come to find out she was having the typical no one understands me and my parents just don’t understand '' issues most kids have she was just taking it to an extreme 
 i told her what she was doing was wrong and she should talk to someone even if it is a school counselor 
 she actually did it 
 in a sense i became a life coach to this girl for about 6 months 
 she became an invaluable member of the team i helped her filter what she said and to consider others and life was grand 
 about 6 months later i finish up at a <unk> college and am moving away to go to big people college and it’s my last day at pizza place 
 the girl pulls me into the back and just begins to <unk> 
 she says thank you mr. <unk> for giving me a chance when no one else would 
 you saw past the thing i was and saw the woman i could be 
 if it was n't for you i would not have a job i would not have moved out of my <unk> house and i’d probably be dead by now 
 i just wanted to say thank you for hiring me here and for being my friend '' 
 my heart about <unk> on itself 
 i felt so guilty 
 here is this girl pouring her heart out singing my praise because i wanted to troll my boss 
 i hired her as a joke 
 i decided not to tell her 
 i figured i could live with the guilt because not knowing means she feels there is someone in her life that cares 
 fast forward a few years later and i’m in my <unk> going out to lunch and i hear mr webusmaster mr webusmaster '' 
 it was her again 
 her hair was blond apparently she had been dying it black 
 she is the manager of a sandwich shop in the mall going to night classes at college to be a social worker 
 she said she wanted to help others who were in her situation 
 i almost cried 
 felt i would share this with you reddit 
 if the end <unk> the means then why do i feel so guilty 
 tl dr hired a maniacal goth as a joke and accidentally changed her life today at my local retail <unk> i was put on registers to assist the cashiers 
 also my price checking duties were done and i had nothing to do so why not 
 anyway i 'm taking customers and going along my merry way when i was requested by bag lady to put all of her items in one big bag we have 2 types : really small or really big 
 i get requested this now and then and it 's no problem 
 after finishing up i give her her receipt and expect this to be the end of it 
 but not quite : & gt bag lady : hey & gt me : yes 
 & gt bl : why is my bag so heavy 
 of all the things to ask 
 & gt well you requested all the items in one bag 
 & gt bl : yeah but i did n't want the bag to be this heavy 
 i do n't feel like giving a <unk> lesson because i have others waiting & gt bl : the store down the street can put the same amount in their big bags and they 're much lighter 
 your store needs to catch up 
 and she leaves in a huff 
 guess it 's time to go and tell my boss we need anti-gravity bags like the other store.you an overworked and underpaid retail worker 
 me just another customer scrambling to purchase christmas gifts with the tip money i had earned 
 the line was long you were tired 
 customer after customer either not <unk> your presence or berating you for things you can not control 
 i have been there 
 you see you and i are not that different 
 a waitress and a retail worker are one in the same 
 i got to your register and said hello 
 you asked how i was and i actually responded 
 and we had a light conversation about the holiday rush and how i hoped you would make it through 
 you chuckled and said you sure hope so too 
 i could see a little relief in your eyes - a customer remembering that you are human 
 and then i saw what you did 
 you slipped up a paper from beside your register and you scanned it 
 and my <unk> decreased 
 not just a little either 
 a little over $ 20 
 you did n't say a word nor did i but we both smiled 
 thank you 
 come to my world and have a beer or two and dessert on me 
 edit : wow i was not expecting this kind of response 
 thanks y'all 
 and i think i 'll go back after the holidays to give him a gift card for my restaurant : so for some background i worked at one of the fastest growing retail stores in the nation 
 i quit started working in a deli ... quit and then went back to this retail store 
 alright so last weekend i was working in the misses department 
 it was a pretty boring evening and i just wanted the night to be over so i could go home 
 as i 'm doing returns i see a father and his daughter walking by and looking at the clothes 
 the little girl looks about 5 years old 
 she says something to her dad saying mommy would like this one '' 
 i was thinking oh that 's sweet 
 they 're shopping together to get her something '' 
 then i continued on putting clothes away 
 as i was walking back i notice the dad standing there staring at this mannequin 
 i hear her whispering to him and he whispers <unk> 
 somebody 's coming 
 sit still '' little girl : okay '' 
 i walk by and the little girl is standing next to the mannequin 
 straight face 
 holding the mannequins hand 
 <unk> 
 everything 
 i walked by covering my mouth because i tried so hard not to laugh 
 i was smiling so big 
 i can hear them talking still because i 'm like 10 feet away grabbing more clothes to put away 
 little girl : did she see me 
 did she know i was here '' 
 dad : no 
 she thought you were a mannequin 
 sit still 
 she 's coming back '' 
 same 
 exact 
 pose 
 this kid has <unk> 
 she made me smile so big and laugh so hard 
 little girl : did she see me '' 
 dad : nope '' 
 my night was made by a 5 year old 
 i work at a gasoline station full time and of course we always get weird people rolling through buying their cigarettes beer and cheap hot dogs 
 my job is either to ring them out make food or do tasks around the store 
 i often come to work straight from classes at university so i always change my clothes in the bathroom 
 sometimes to save time i just pull on my work shirt over whatever i 'm currently wearing if it 's easier to just use my normal clothes as an <unk> 
 this particular day i had come back after a particularly hot day and was wearing some jeans and a tank top 
 i admit my tank top was a bit low cut but i was n't inappropriate 
 i had walked past the counter on my way to the back when a woman starts grumbling to her boyfriend in line about my shirt 
 just normal stuff like why does she feel the need to dress like that '' 
 and who is she trying to impress '' 
 i ignore her and pull on my t-shirt <unk> my tank top and <unk> my name badge tie up my hair and walk out to the front after clocking in the help the customers 
 and the lady goes ballistic on me 
 i do n't know what got under her skin but she completely <unk> the queue to walk up to my register and starts shrieking at me 
 & gt customer : i ca n't believe they hired you 
 you just walk in with your tits hanging out 
 and then you expect me to treat you like everyone else 
 now i 'm kind of shocked because woah she got angry after i put on more clothes 
 i stare at her in shock and try to collect myself 
 & gt me : well i interviewed well 
 how can i help you today 
 & gt customer : you can take your tits and go home 
 i thought this place was more classy than this 
 and without any other words she dropped all her items on my counter and walked out 
 and stood next to the door shouting at other people about the <unk> behind the counter '' 
 i just do n't understand 
 <unk> in tl dr : ** lady got offended by my excessive amount of clothing 
 says i can take my tits and go <unk> knows a grinch 
 a scrooge 
 a c. <unk> burns 
 somebody who for whatever reason makes it their mission to ruin the happiness of others 
 in normal everyday life we can ignore the scrooges or if they 're particularly horrible just punch them in the face and be done with it 
 but when you have a scrooge for a customer you can unfortunately neither punch nor ignore him 
 such is the case with my store 's mr. green name edited to protect the <unk> <unk> 
 mr. green is on the <unk> down side of a mid-life <unk> his <unk> has <unk> itself and is slowly but <unk> pushing the <unk> out of his head 
 he seems to have developed a tolerance for diet <unk> because his spare tire has returned with a vengeance 
 the credit cards he was issued to finance his new childhood are coming up declined more and more and his <unk> mustang convertible has ancient <unk> <unk> on the leather from the numerous times he 's parked it without putting the top back on 
 were it not for his <unk> mr. green would be a <unk> fellow 
 mr. green comes to our clothing shop at least three times a week always following the same routine 
 on monday he will come in and purchase a lot of clothing 
 on tuesday we 'll get a call from mr. green informing us that he 's dissatisfied with the clothing 
 on wednesday he 'll come back to the store to return the items he 's dissatisfied with 
 on thursday we 'll get another call in which he insists that one of his many <unk> credit cards was not <unk> back the proper amount 
 he gives us a day off on friday though we do n't know why 
 on saturday he 'll come back in to argue and haggle with our manager to try to get more money than he is owed 
 week in week out this is how it goes with mr. green 
 <unk> itself this would not be reason enough to hate the man 
 a customer may be very difficult even demanding but that alone does n't make him an asshole 
 <unk> an asshole* about it is what makes him an asshole 
 he has on numerous occasions insulted our staff even using the n-word on one of our cashiers when the total of his purchase exceeded his original <unk> 
 he parks in handicapped spaces 
 <unk> <unk> he will drive his gross mustang in facing the store <unk> 
 whenever he 's confronted about it he shrugs saying the sooner i 'm done here the sooner the spaces will be free again 
 chop chop '' 
 he 's been asked to leave several times after sexually harassing female and usually <unk> 
 * customers each time vowing to sue if he was <unk> 
 and he would always get away with *all of it * because the owner was his best high school buddy 
 that is until recently 
 last week our owner sold out his franchise to the corporate company from which he had purchased the license 
 we the employees had feared this meant that the store would simply close and we 'd be out of jobs 
 but mercifully teenage hipster clothing store <unk> decided to keep our location open 
 they promoted one of our floor managers tony who had been called the n-word by mr. green to the position of general manager 
 *and* our hourly wage was raised by <unk> cents 
 suffice to say we 're all ready to give a salute to our <unk> corporate overlords but the best was yet to come 
 the night before his first shift as general manager a friday and obviously after his promotion had been announced to the rest of us employees one of the guys asked tony what he planned to do about mr. green 
 tony already the model of a corporate-type said only just do your jobs like you already do and do n't worry about it '' 
 the next day saturday mr. green showed up just like always to try to eke more money than he was owed out of us 
 he parked across the two closest handicap spaces just like always 
 he marched into the store and asked to be shown to the <unk> section even though he knew where it was by heart 
 but before anyone could even approach tony was already there 
 tony had <unk> himself between mr. green and the rest of the store proper on the tile <unk> directly in front of the automatic sliding doors 
 tony had an object in his hand which i did n't immediately recognize 
 i feared momentarily that it might have been a weapon 
 i could n't hear what tony said to mr. green but the voice with which he said it was low and menacing 
 my <unk> grew 
 *is tony about to shoot mr 
 green 
 * mr. green 's eyes grew wide as tony spoke 
 at first i <unk> this to being threatened with bodily harm but i watched the expression grow from one of surprise to indignation 
 what the fuck are you talking about '' 
 mr. green screeched 
 i want to see former owner 's name 
 right now '' 
 more <unk> conversation from tony who had begun to draw himself up to his full height of 6'3 '' 
 i was now certain that tony was about to murder mr. green right there on the tile floor 
 fuck you '' 
 mr. green roared 
 i 've been coming here for years 
 you ca n't just throw me out 
 i have n't even done anything '' 
 at which point tony produced the item 
 he held it in front of his own face and i finally recognized a polaroid camera 
 it flashed as tony held it steady momentarily confusing mr. green who then launched into a full-on <unk> 
 tony walked away from mr. green 
 as he passed by me toward the offices in the back of the store he <unk> do n't let him have shit 
 and make sure he does n't steal anything '' 
 not far behind him <unk> and <unk> cursing a blue streak was mr. green demanding that picture tony had taken was his property that he had no right etc. etc 
 when he got to me i politely <unk> myself between him and the entrance to the office explaining i 'm sorry mr. green 
 employees only '' 
 bullshit '' 
 he declared trying to walk around me 
 i quickly backed up putting myself direclty in front of the doorway to the offices 
 i 'm really sorry mr. green but you ca n't go back there '' 
 he looked about ready to body check me at this point so i shrugged and moved out of the way 
 mr. green gave me a filthy look as he moved and tried to open the door which was locked 
 mr. green began to pound on the door making threats legal bodily and <unk> 
 he went on like this for about a solid minute before tony opened the door and stepped out 
 mr. green <unk> himself as tony returned ready for a fight 
 but tony <unk> him and walked straight to me 
 he handed me a stack of papers each was a <unk> which <unk> the words persona non <unk> '' above a photograph of mr. green in <unk> 
 put these on all of the entrances and behind every cashier 's station '' tony said speaking slowly his voice an <unk> bass of angry <unk> 
 mr. green had leaned over to see what it was that tony had handed me and started <unk> his protestations 
 tony paid him no mind and brushed past him back into the office 
 mr. green continued his <unk> and pounding on the door looking like the big bad wolf if the big bad wolf had let himself go and tried to cover it up with hipster clothing 
 he <unk> me turning to walk to the entrance and came towards me saying if you put those up i will sue you for <unk> of character and discrimination '' 
 i was unsure of what to do because i do n't want to get sued even if it 's pretty unlikely but <unk> the idea of humiliating mr. green 
 i was saved from hesitation by an announcement over the store 's <unk> it was tony 's voice calmly announcing to the driver of the yellow mustang convertible your car is being towed '' 
 there was a moment of silence as both mr. green and i came to understand what that meant 
 and quicker than i 've ever seen him move mr. green <unk> down the aisle towards the entrance 
 i followed and looked out the large glass doors at the entrance to our store to see mr. green <unk> and <unk> at the tow-truck <unk> who had already begun to load his car into the bed of the truck 
 when i turned around there was tony with a grin a mile wide on his face the same grin which <unk> on my own face 
 we have n't seen mr. green at all this week and i 'm starting to think that we never will again 
 2014 might be a very good year indeed 
 tl dr jerk customer does n't get what he wants for christmas 
 tow-truck driver <unk> the grinch.it was a typical christmas eve in a liquor store 
 lines all the way to the back and rude people left and right 
 after being yelled at over the phone for not carrying <unk> yams really 
 its a freaking liquor store 
 and being yelled at in person because we ran out of <unk> alcoholic eggnog i had a man walk up and ask me if i could make change for a $ 100 bill 
 when i handed him the bills he handed me $ 50 said merry christmas you 're almost done '' 
 and walked out 
 just the shock of someone giving such a large amount of money while being surrounded by the rudest people ive ever seen completely overwhelmed me 
 that stranger made my holiday 
 i can now afford to pick up something for myself so that i can enjoy my christmas alone instead of <unk> around 
 so whoever and wherever you are stranger thank you 
 edit : thank you all so much 
 waking up to all of these comments was wonderful 
 merry christmas to you all 
 i hope every one of you have a great holiday 
 hello everyone 
 here is the story of how i will most likely lose my job 
 <unk> 
 background : i work as amongst other things as an art gallery assistant 
 we hang shows and sell artwork it is similar to retail in many ways 
 lots of work long hours and people that make you question humanity and its knowledge 
 this weekend i had the job of taking down an art show 
 my boss is gone for the next few weeks so i 've been in charge 
 stressful does n't being to cover it 
 i rent the company van and pick up our interns who are college students looking to gain <unk> 
 in the field 
 one is trained and the new one let 's call him bob is not 
 bob is not there 
 on the way to work he sends a text saying his family is in town and he is not coming in 
 i 'm not happy 
 my boss is expecting me to have all this work done and i need bob because he is the only muscle we have 
 i tell him to come by after he is done eating with his parents if he can 
 bob says okay 
 fast forward to being at work 
 the other intern and i are beginning our shift seeing what pieces did n't sell and those that did 
 bob sends another message saying that he is outside 
 bob then comes in with his girlfriend and entire family 
 his mother then begins to yell at me 
 mom : how dare you make my son come into work today when we are in town 
 this is the only day we can see him and you are ruining our <unk> '' 
 me : <unk> well ... ma'am ... your son has known that he has had to work today for two weeks 
 i saw him two days ago and confirmed that he would be here 
 if you want you guys can go out to eat and drop him off here later 
 i can take him back to his <unk> '' 
 mom : no 
 no 
 forget it 
 we are already here 
 we 're gon na help him so he can leave early '' 
 me : umm ... your son is already late for his shift but i can have him out of here by <unk> unfortunately i can not use your help 
 you are welcome to look around or go explore downtown until it gets closer to 2:00 '' 
 mom : fine '' 
 i then went back to getting bob started 
 the father stops me to ask an absurd question which i answer in my best retail voice when i hear bob calling for me 
 he is confused on how to get a screw out of the wall ... with a hammer 
 bless his heart 
 i take bob to our <unk> where we have ... .wait for it ... <unk> drill 
 i am explaining how to drill works when i hear a loud crash 
 i run out to find bob 's irate mother standing there with a broken sculpture all over the floor 
 i now know what fear and angry feels like when combined in a perfect storm 
 me : *shaking in rage while giving a <unk> streep performance of retail <unk> what are you doing with the art '' 
 mom : * can not even see death in front of her* i 'm helping my son so he can leave early '' 
 me : you are not allowed to handle the art 
 i can handle it because that 's my job and i have been trained 
 intern has been trained 
 today i was going to train your son 
 not you 
 not your husband or daughter or bob 's girlfriend but bob 
 you have no right to be handling a piece '' 
 the guard is located and a report is filed out 
 the parents keep getting in my face and asking me questions until i have to leave and call my boss to report what has happened 
 boss is not happy and as shocked as me 
 tells me to send bob and company away 
 i return to bob and his <unk> and tell them to please leave 
 the father spends 20 minutes arguing with me 
 dad : what makes you qualified 
 you 're just a kid 
 will my son get in trouble 
 will we have to pay for it 
 it said nfs so it 's like free right 
 how much does it cost 
 20 bucks 
 100 '' 
 me : i have held this job for over two years and i have never damaged a piece or had one of the interns damage one 
 i do n't know what will happen regarding your son 's position or payment for the broken art 
 nfs means not for sale 
 that piece is easily worth $ <unk> 
 it is generally understood that interns do n't bring their parents to work nor do <unk> touch artwork '' 
 dad : oh well haha 
 accidents happen '' 
 me : not on my watch they do n't 
 i do n't break art and my interns do n't break art 
 your wife did however because she had no business touching the work 
 i have spoken with my supervisor and she has said that you all and bob should leave '' 
 the family then left the mother hiding behind a <unk> and glaring at me the entire time 
 the rest of the day was full of panic and tears on my behalf 
 i will most likely loose my job 
 sorry for the long post and thanks for reading the <unk> of the gallery assistant 
 edit : i was not the one who let bob and co in but the security guard who was at the door playing on his phone 
 edit 2 : tl dr boss left me in charge of training new employee 
 employee brought entire family to his work 
 idiot mother broke an expensive sculpture 
 awaiting my fate ... update : hey everyone 
 it seems my update reply has been lost in the comments 
 a few <unk> have requested an update so here i am 
 first thanks for all your comments both positive and negative 
 reading them has really helped 
 during a staff meeting a few days ago when boss returned boss spoke with me and bob 
 bob was told he had a strike against him for being late to his shift and was dismissed 
 afterwards boss spent roughly twenty minutes lecturing me how parents should always trump work and how it is not bob 's fault but mine since this is his first job and not mine 
 i made it very clear that i had given bob and his parents the option to go bob 's mom acted on her own and looking back there was little i could do to stop it 
 nowhere have i ever been allowed to miss a shift for wanting to hang out with my <unk> last minute 
 i politely said this and that how in many other jobs this type of <unk> and behavior would result in termination 
 boss said its better to agree than disagree 
 my job is still <unk> i have been at my assistant position longer than any of my bosses so i am an asset 
 the artist will get <unk> by the gallery insurance 
 this story reminded me of my time in the copy shop many moons ago at the copy shop we got our first large format color printer 
 it printed 3 feet wide by about a hundred feet if you wanted to 
 <unk> at the time wanted it front and center so customers could ooh and ahh over this new machine and hopefully want something printed 
 this chinese couple came in and asked if we could print a life sized poster of them 
 they had a really nice photo of themselves in front of an old church 
 i did the math and it was about a 3 x 7 print they needed because they wanted to doors to show 
 they also wanted it on glossy paper 
 now here 's the problem this first <unk> printer could print on glossy paper it just took 10-15 minutes to dry 
 this meant you let the print hang for a bit after it finished so it would n't <unk> 
 so i 'm printing out the picture happy because this thing is going to cost about $ 350 
 it 's about halfway done and i 'm handling several other things when i look over and this little kid walks up to the printer and rubs his hands all over the print as it 's coming out 
 little finger prints and a couple of <unk> right in the middle of the print 
 i <unk> the kid away and restart the print 
 he of course comes back and is approaching the printer 
 this time i shout at him to back off 
 his parent who is several feet away and not paying attention comes over and demands why i 'm shouting at her kid 
 i show her the ruined print on the counter next to me 
 i tell her that her spawn did that and he was about to do it again 
 she tried to blow it off as no big deal until i told her that if her child ruined the second print i was charging her for both at full price $ 700+ 
 at that point she grabbed her kid by the wrist and basically lifted him off the floor and several yards away from the <unk> it 's a late night in the store i work at as the department supervisor in the shoe department and a woman and her daughter come up to the girls <unk> 
 they 're going through different styles and she 's trying them on when the little girl comes up with a pair and asks if we have them in a size two 
 after retrieving the shoes from the stockroom the girl thanks me with a smile and decides to take them 
 when the little girl was done she started putting the shoes back in the box and back on the shelves the mom grabbed her little daughter by the wrist and says oh no it 's okay sweetie the man will do that '' points to me and drags her away 
 it was n't that much to clean up but that 's an awful thing to teach a young <unk> do car sales and i had a customer place an order for his dream vehicle he was active duty his wife was next to him and it was a special order from the factory 
 all said and done and we are waiting for the car to arrive when one day he comes in all sad eyed and things like that and i 'm like dude whats up '' he goes the wife says i ca n't get the car cause she wants a bmw '' and i said but i thought you had just bought your wife a lexus 2 yrs ago and now was your turn '' 
 he goes yea ... but she fell in love with a bmw '' and i go well do you like it '' 
 he goes nah i want my challenger '' i said i understand ... i mean why do n't you just tell her its your turn and you want your dream car she already got hers ... she can wait for the bmw '' 
 he responded she told me to cancel '' i fired back is she your boss '' 
 this is a summary of the conversation he agreed he should stick with his dream car he has the money great credit and its a gift they agreed upon 
 he was going home and going tell his wife what was up 
 he came back the next day with his wife in tow 
 they came in sat down and said she said we are going cancel this order right now '' we went back and forth reminding them they are n't going get their deposit back etc all because she wants a bmw 
 she finally says look i deserve the bmw i work hard and i deserve the best of the best '' keep in mind the bmw was clearly out of this mans price range costing near $ <unk> so to which i said o what do you do '' 
 she goes i give him the best <unk> on this earth '' and i respond so what your saying is your extremely pricey whore '' 
 she said excuse me '' 
 my customer is sitting as far back in his seat ... <unk> enough with a smile on his face 
 she asks me to say it again ... so i do 
 she says i have no right to say that 
 i <unk> my statement most likely should n't of done that i was having a bad day she of course complained to my management who scolded me i shrugged it off ... fuck her she 's a bitch 
 deal was canceled customer did n't get his money back although he was told if he did decide to come back we 'd let him use his deposit in addition to another deposit on any vehicle 
 3 weeks later he came in said after i bought up the whore '' idea it set something off in his mind and he did some digging ... apparently she really was a whore and had 2 affairs ongoing ... he was getting a divorce so he reordered his challenger 
 <unk> <unk> btw she was incredibly bitchy 
 bit more backstory i 'm actually still in contact with this guy as i am most of my customers 
 he got successfully divorced because of the evidence he had on her she basically got nothing in the divorce 
 she ended up marrying one of the guys she was having an <unk> on 
 my customer took her lexus and traded it in when the challenger came in car was in his name the challenger was <unk> in <unk> orange with the t grip shifter <unk> navigation <unk> sound system 
 he since put on some very <unk> <unk> and done a bit of exterior <unk> 
 car looks pretty sweet 
 my customer is doing well and very happy with current situation 
 as per my comments to his wife ... management did n't shrug it off '' i did get in quite abit of trouble and was very nearly suspended which is something we never really do also exceptions to our rules where put on <unk> 
 aka all my deals had to be perfectly clean for the next month which is incredibly difficult to accomplish 
 i 've also been <unk> not to make a habit of calling my women <unk> ... its bad for business 
 if your curious why i did n't get fired ... well i 'm a really good sales person with really good results and a great customer service record ... this was one serious <unk> in my reputation 
 started a new job at a convenience store & amp gas station a few weeks ago it has n't been so bad aside from every other person i ask id for getting upset 
 i 'm pretty sure the law <unk> from place to place but here you are allowed to pump gas then come inside to pay 
 also we got rid of our penny like three years ago 
 anyway this morning i was dealing with the rush of people we get and this one guy comes up slams $ 15 on my counter says it 's for pump 4 and turns to leave 
 thankfully i was n't busy that very second and was able to see that no pump 4 came up to $ <unk> 
 i yell hey you need five more cents for pump 4 '' and this guy 's face instantly turns to a scowl 
 & gt him : what do you mean 5 more cents 
 & gt me : you pumped fifteen dollars and 4 cents in gas 
 you got a <unk> or something on you 
 & gt him : it gets rounded down you idiot 
 i live in a pretty small town most of the people here are rather polite so this caught me off guard 
 also i totally had some change sitting right there on the till for this exact reason but he lost that <unk> as soon as he called me an idiot 
 & gt me : no actually the 4 cents gets rounded up to 5 cents 
 that means you owe 15 dollars and five cents 
 you must have some change somewhere 
 & gt him : no 
 it 's fifteen dollars even you idiot 
 at this point i grab the $ 15 punch it into my pos and big surprise - it 's asking for 5 more cents 
 & gt me : see it still needs 5 more cents 
 surely you must have it in your car or something 
 he storms off muttering something under his breath i put 5 cents in the till so i can help the next people in line get a few what 's that guy 's problem '' from the people behind him then he storms back in 
 & gt him : i do n't have your damn change 
 & gt me : well sorry i actually do n't know what to do in this situation 
 i 'm new at the job but my till needs to be even 
 you could ask somebody else for <unk> & gt him : no 
 you know damn well it gets rounded down 
 either you 're an idiot or this place is ripping me off 
 & gt me : four cents has rounded up to five cents for the last three years 
 i do n't know why you think it gets rounded <unk> & gt him : you 're a <unk> idiot 
 he then actually leaves the store and drives off 
 when my manager showed up this morning i made sure to tell him about the guy and he 's asking he actually drove off without paying the full amount 
 i tell him yes he says that 's theft and he 'll be looking at the security footage 
 hopefully this idiot gets charged or banned over 5 <unk> everyone 
 long time lurker and first time poster 
 so a little background : i work at a <unk> kind of thing with a small grocery section a back register to order food and a front register to ring out 
 most of our revenue comes from catering and special orders but we also have a lot of people eat in 
 so we keep <unk> at the register and we sell the <unk> ones for half off 
 if they aren’t sold by the end of the night we either toss them or give them to the line cook 
 it’s five minutes to close and some customers walk in : a police officer we’ll call her po a mom and her 6-7 year old daughter let’s call her qt- because she sure is one 
 after everyone orders i’m ringing them all out and the following happens : & gt qt : mommy look at that muffin 
 & gt mom : not today sweetie 
 i don’t have enough money 
 so after paying they sit down and wait for their order to come up 
 qt is looking kind of sad 
 when it’s ready and all bagged up i add in the muffin for free 
 & gt me : here you go miss 
 i added that muffin in there for you for free because we’re almost closed anyway 
 & gt mom : thank you so much 
 qt what do you say to the nice lady 
 & gt qt : no mommy 
 put that back youre stealing 
 & gt mom : no sweetie the nice lady gave it to us… & gt qt : no mommy you’re stealing and the police lady is gon na come and arrest us 
 put the muffin back or i’m telling on you 
 i try to explain to her that it’s a present so she isn’t stealing and that po won’t come arrest her for accepting a present 
 it seems like she’s having a hard time understanding but i think she finally gets it 
 & gt qt : looks up at po can i have the muffin please 
 & gt po : i’ll let it go this one time 
 winks at me 
 & gt qt : looking at me now thank you so much 
 are the doors going to go <unk> when i leave 
 & gt me : no don’t <unk> it’s your muffin so you get to take it home 
 her and her mom left after this with both the mom and po laughing pretty hard 
 i can hear qt screaming <unk> in the parking lot until their car leaves 
 why can’t every customer be this adorable 
 **the finale of an extremely long/involved story 
 all of it is 100 % true of my worst 
 day 
 ever 
 ** if you missed the first two parts here are the links 
 ** the chinese wedding { epic worst day } part 1 ** the chinese wedding { epic worst day } part 2 6:15 - i pull up to the restaurant to my final drop off an hour and 15 minutes over 
 **9½ out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale 
 possibly foaming at the mouth not sure i had been going over the details of the day in my head during the long traffic ridden drive over 
 pretty sure father of the bride fotb was n't going to pay for the extra hour plus and this added to my wrath 
 i mean i was tricked into putting on a bow that both sneakywc and fotb knew they could n't put on 
 i was almost run over in the middle of sunset blvd 
 forced to do car repairs on the asphalt in my only good suit 
 made to do an unscheduled <unk> knowing full well they should have paid for it 
 i 'd been yelled at insulted my top button on my shirt was broken definitely had to take my suit to get dry cleaned ... not a happy camper at this moment 
 <unk> the limo to the side of the curb we are cheerfully greeted by 30 wedding guests all outside waiting to catch the first <unk> of the newlyweds 
 i had been so focused on my <unk> confrontation with fotb that i had neglected to fully grasp just how the groom and bride were doing 
 i had n't checked on them in a while 
 they had been in the back of a sweltering hot limo with no power for close to 45 minutes 
 with no means to roll the windows down you can imagine what that would do to makeup and hair 
 i open the door to a crowd of cheers only to be followed by ** <unk> 
 uhhh and then followed by awkward silence 
 the door in front of me is blocking my view but the bride finally steps out 
 i my face <unk> 's as the bride <unk> from the limo 
 her makeup was smeared <unk> dripping down part of her base makeup was stained on her <unk> ... the crowd and i were speechless 
 not only had she been crying but her new husband was worse for wear as he emerged looking like he ran a marathon himself 
 uhh crap 
 what the hell 
 the back of the limo had power why did n't they turn the <unk> on 
 then it dawned on me 
 when the cable was severed it tripped the circuit <unk> to the back <unk> so apparently they had no ac 
 just hot air blowing during the trip back and they never told me as had rolled the partition up 
 uhhh ... holy crap ... was not expecting this 
 the fotb has daggers in his eyes and a face vaguely <unk> of that dude from big trouble in little china he starts to lose it and all his <unk> is directed at me 
 * * ... what the hell is this 
 you dare treat my daughter this way 
 * **i demand a full <unk> '' i 've already experienced the wrath of this man twice today and now i was about to get it again 
 * *i 'm going to sue you 
 * '' snap 
 i lost it ... mountain <unk> <unk> is about to blow 
 if you 've ever heard that expression that someone can get so mad that they see red well i can personal <unk> that i saw red 
 i 'm so livid i 'm **hearing what the smell of red tastes like** on the pissed off '' scale 
 i 'll leave out the <unk> i said during this epic rant because i am pretty sure i was legally insane at this point 
 i <unk> off every swear word i could think of ... then made a dozen more up just for flavor 
 i was so pissed that i was ready to fight all 30 of them and lose in a glorious defeat and i would n't have cared 
 fotb balled up his <unk> and was ready to strike 
 to his credit he did n't and i still have no idea why besides my foaming at the mouth rant and wild arm flailing motions 
 the crowd was stunned into silence the bride was weeping in her <unk> arms people from across the streets were stopping to watch 
 pretty sure an open jawed mouthed mother covered her child 's ears in horror 
 the fotb stands his ground and with controlled fury and tells me that he will not pay 
 according to him i owe him the cost of the epic screw ups that occurred and <unk> of the bow 
 uhh what 
 he is going to charge me for ruining the bow after all that just happened 
 he was the one that insisted it be placed on the limo when he was told no in the first place 
 this <unk> me back into reality 
 my top had blown my fury <unk> and now i was able to think straight 
 he wants to sue me 
 ohh <unk> no 
 ** * wait wait wait ... you 're going to sue me 
 i 'm going to sue you 
 i do n't give him any opportunity to respond **fact 1** you knew you were n't allow to put that @ # $ % bow on my limo but you did anyways 
 the boss told you over the phone absolutely no bow but you <unk> with the wedding coordinator and blindsided me to put it on 
 you lied 
 period 
 **fact 2** your wife and daughter bride made me go out in traffic <unk> my life to go get a bow ... a @ % # $ ing bow 
 the contract states that putting the driver in any danger including life <unk> situation is grounds of termination of the run i show him the line in the contract he signed 
 **fact 3** that bow that you and sneakywc had me put on caused physical damage to this limousine 
 damage that you are responsible for 
 it severed a power line and possibly caused permanent engine damage '' 
 this speech which i had <unk> in my head on the way over had me running through lines after lines <unk> 
 my throat was sore my voice was shot and my blood pressure was probably off the <unk> but i was able to get all my points out 
 pretty sure one of the guests <unk> <unk> 
 is his face is purple .. * '' 
 it probably was 
 the bluster from fotb was definitely gone at this point 
 his body had relaxed shoulders less tense as he realized he was up a crap creek and i was the only one giving out paddles 
 with his daughter still sobbing and my own bluster was fading the scene became much more calm and controlled 
 i was still very pissed but fotb was n't finished with me yet 
 just the shouting match had ended 
 * lets talk about this '' his eyes were no longer looking at me 
 a sign that he knows what i said was true 
 lets negotiate an arrangement in price '' 
 the dude was <unk> with me ... in front of 30 guests his weeping bride of a daughter and a stunned crowd still gathering 
 no attempt to take me aside or speak <unk> 
 i was floored ... honest to god stunned at his gall 
 * ... <unk> 
 what 's to negotiate 
 it was your *negotiating* that <unk> this whole thing 
 you did n't want to pay my company the $ 80 bucks for the extra pick up which caused the wedding to start late in the first place ... then you did n't want to hear no for an answer with the @ # $ @ ing bow being put on the car '' 
 i let my words hang there for a bit and then said the thing i regretted 
 to this day i wish i could have taken them back 
 true or not right or wrong there are just some things you should n't say 
 i have no excuse for my words and the events of this day are certainly not ones i 'll use 
 * it was your <unk> who caused all of this to happen 
 you did n't want to pay extra or hire another limo company that would allow a bow to be placed on the front ... probably because you were too cheap ... so all this happened 
 **you f & amp # $ ing ruining your daughters wedding 
 ** do you know that '' 
 the shock of what i said caused the crowd to <unk> their eyes and move away 
 this was a low blow 
 i should have just taken his attitude like a man should have let the boss handle all of this should have done a lot of things but i let my anger control me 
 most of the guests went inside and others kept their distance and the <unk> vanished to <unk> in reception pity 
 fotb had tears <unk> up in his eyes and his body was <unk> from the pain of it 
 my heart <unk> 
 i just officially ruined his daughters wedding and insulted a proud man in front of his family and relatives 
 all of my anger was gone ... vanished with the sight of this broken man who realized he royally screwed up 
 i <unk> through a weak apology but it was too little too late 
 the damage was done 
 we calmly discussed some business things and he agreed not to press any of the issues with the limo 
 nobody was suing nobody 
 i told him i would do my best in controlling my boss but if there was permanent damage there was nothing i could do about it 
 as we parted ways he actually shook my hand 
 uhh ... what 
 he shook my hand after that epic meltdown 
 are you crapping me 
 wait ... $ 20 bucks in my hand 
 he tipped me 
 holy crap the guy actually tipped me after all this ... my mind was swimming in what the hell just happened '' thoughts and i hazily make my way to the car 
 i dial up my limo buddy and proceed to explain everything in as much detail as possible 
 i 'm still on the phone as i pull into the nearest gas station to clock out 
 i put the nozzle in start to fill the tank and continue talking in <unk> detail 
 i 'm wandering around as i talk being pumped full of <unk> and all when i notice something 
 i **burst out <unk> and my poor friend is wondering wtf is going on 
 i ca n't breath i 'm laughing so hard 
 tears are actually welling up in my face and i 'm coughing to get air in my lungs 
 * *through bursts of laughter* ... **the bow ... its still on the front of the car 
 ** '' *edit : just the cut up ribbons were in the back the <unk> had never been removed from earlier 
 * **epilogue** the boss was told this story in full gory detail a few days later after he calmed down 
 i gave him the bow for him to deal with if the client was to press any issues 
 we never heard from the fotb the bride or groom again and they never called to claim the remains of their heirloom 
 the bow however became something of a legend at my old work as the story got passed from driver to driver 
 i ended up keeping the remains of the bow after enough time had passed in lost and found 
 i ended up losing it in a move a while back and now i 'm attempting to find an old photo i took of it 
 no luck so far as i might have left it in the same box as the bow 
 in the end the boss was still pissed at me for about a month but as there was no permanent damage other than the severed cable he eventually let it go 
 i 've told this story hundreds of times to friends and family and it gets <unk> just about every christmas to anyone who brings someone new 
 it brought a lot of anger and pain to me for a while but i matured and grew a <unk> 
 i can now laugh at my misfortune because i ca n't change the past 
 only learn from it 
 special note : if you are or somehow know the chinese couple who this story is about please tell them this 
 <unk> accept my <unk> apologies for all that happened this day 
 now you know my side of the story and i hope to hear from you again over a beer if you are ok with it 
 i am truly sorry for all that happened that day 
 i wish you two the best of luck wherever you are and my deepest sympathy goes out on your behalf 
 * '' thanks for taking a journey with me on the worst day i 've ever had 
 *thank you for the gold whoever you <unk> just walked in and said your curb just ripped the bumper off my car '' 
 i think i giggled a little 
 i was so taken aback 
 i finally said i 'm sorry my curb did n't do anything it just sat there '' 
 he did n't say anything just looked at me for a minute 
 finally i said you 'll have to talk to your insurance about that '' 
 he angrily huffed out of here and banged on the elevator a bit when he left 
 but it 's not my curb that <unk> toy store 3 days before christmas 
 entire aisles are barren 
 naturally we completely <unk> the back stock rooms days ago to <unk> compensate for not having any merchandise on the shelves but i am still asked dozens of times every day if there are any more of some arbitrary product in the back 
 most people accept that we do n't have any more until our next truck comes in but this guy g was particularly amusing 
 as i 'm cleaning up in the evening : & gt g : hey do you have any more of this in the back 
 this box is <unk> up 
 & gt me : afraid not we do n't have any merchandise in the back at all right now 
 & gt g : yeah sure 
 you 're just trying to get back to work correct 
 by blowing me off 
 now stop being lazy and check 
 incidentally this conversation was taking place very close to our back stock room 
 so ... & gt me : okay ... would you like to come with me just to make sure 
 i do n't mind 
 *me and g enter the back room he takes one step inside and sees <unk> no product on a solid 50 yards of empty shelves 
 * & gt g : you 're a real smartass 
 & gt me : okay 
 i probably am a smartass for doing that but damn if it was n't <unk> 
 edit : thanks for the gold you made the christmas eve morning i actually managed to get off even better i was put on cashier duty a few days back and of all the people i got that day this one mother stood out to me the most 
 as i was scanning her items she took small gum pack off one of my displays 
 she showed it to her kids and asked if they wanted any 
 & gt child : can we get some 
 & gt mom : remember we do n't chew gum in this family she then turned the packet around and started reading the ingredients 
 and she pronounced them all correctly meaning she has memorized them and <unk> incredibly long ingredients 
 & gt mom : look at all these chemicals 
 pure poison 
 just then this woman just behind them decided to add her <unk> & gt other woman : you know that some ingredient listed kills dogs in a large amount 
 imagine what that does to kids 
 i finished ringing up this mothers final products : <unk> <unk> <unk> crunch and a <unk> of <unk> this week i had a customer ask if we were hiring 
 i shrugged my shoulders and let her know that she is always welcome to drop off a resume 
 oops mistake # 1 
 <unk> hours later crazy lady cl calls 
 & gt cl : oh good it 's you 
 so i am trying to write my resume but i am not sure what i should put for skills 
 what skills do you think i need to do your job 
 & gt me : you can probably check out the company 's website and find relevant information there 
 sorry but i ca n't help you beyond that 
 & gt cl : no i am confused 
 walk me through this 
 it 's your job you work in customer service so serve the customer 
 & gt me : sorry ma'am but i ca n't write your resume for you 
 have a great day 
 i hang up on her and convey this info to my boss 
 my boss laughs and we both <unk> that this lady is an idiot 
 about 20 minutes later the phone rings 
 i pick it up and it 's the same lady 
 & gt cl : hello 
 so i started writing some skills but i do n't know if it 's any good 
 can i read them to you 
 *at this point i am very annoyed and have lost my patience 
 * & gt me : well i honestly would not bother 
 my manager would never hire anyone as incompetent as you are 
 *click* she ended up calling again and my boss let her have it 
 crazzzzzy lady 
 o.oyesterday i was working at my store 's customer help desk 
 this is different from customer service they mainly process returns and resolve complaints while i help customers find products set up deliveries and call other locations to confirm their stock for customers 
 this desk also sells nonstandard batteries regular ones like aa <unk> etc have their own shelf elsewhere 
 around noon a customer c walks up to the desk to ask me m a question 
 m : how may i help you today 
 c : hi can you tell me where i can get batteries 
 m : yes the regular ones are in aisle <unk> but if you want something like these you can only get them at this desk 
 i open the drawer and pull out a <unk> of cr2032 batteries 
 we sell several kinds of special batteries but cr2032 is by far the most commonly requested one and i guess not many customers know this 
 c : oh my god how did you do that 
 that 's the one i need 
 and i needed two of them 
 i try to explain that most people ask for that size but he continues to be bewildered 
 c : it 's like you read my mind or something 
 he pays for the batteries and leaves with the biggest smile on his face 
 **edit** forgot a <unk> only had the pleasure of <unk> this conversation part way through because i noticed a loud voice and rude tone all of a sudden 
 but basically the other day a guy came into our store questioning why he was n't phoned back for an interview when he applied over a week ago and our job posting is still online 
 my supervisor tells him that we get a high volume of applications and if my store manager who is in charge of hiring decides to hold an interview he will call to schedule a time 
 & gt applicant : i need a job 
 i 'm here right now telling you i 'm ready willing and able to work and you 're just throwing me out the door 
 & gt supervisor : they need to look over your application and they 'll let you know sir 
 & gt applicant : how will they know who i am 
 & gt supervisor : did you include your name and number on your application 
 & gt applicant : yes 
 but i want it to be known that i 'm here now ready and able to work 
 & gt supervisor : i can get you the store manager if you like since he oversees the hiring 
 & gt applicant : no 
 his voice gets <unk> but he starts pointing and doing weird hand gestures at my supervisor she concludes saying she will take a physical copy of his resume since he has it with him and forward it along to my store manager he was n't happy with this gives her a few more comments <unk> his anger and walks out of the store 
 he walks right by me to the door and says & gt <unk> : what a jerk 
 i ca n't believe this fucking stupid place 
 and he 's confused why he does n't have a job 
 you do n't harass employees into giving you a job sir 
 upfront apologies for any grammar or spelling mistakes 
 i work in a large thrift store about 40 miles outside of <unk> al 
 it 's a christian run organization that has several <unk> that it gives to and the one we give to helps <unk> women and children 
 each location has it 's own that it gives to 
 i think last year is was somewhere around 51 % of our <unk> profit that we gave them 
 several million dollars easily 
 and while i am not christian i love what the store does and the people who work there are awesome 
 now on to the real meat of the story 
 our basic operations is run through donations 
 people can come to the store and drop off their junk where it 's taken to the back weighed counted processed <unk> labeled and then finally put onto the sales floor 
 one piece of clothing will pass between four to five people before reaching the customer 
 and we also do what we call <unk> which is when we send our trucks to your house to pick stuff up 
 mostly furniture 
 now when all is said and done we have invested labor space time and fuel into getting these items to sell at our store 
 but this is semi rural alabama 
 to say people are cheap would be charitable and there is always someone who wants to haggle and barter 
 we do n't do either 
 and they will throw out a line like but you got it for free '' 
 no ... no we did n't 
 but out of all of those times i have been told this one in particular sticks out and still makes me rage a little 
 i was helping out the front end while the main lady was taking her break 
 no big deal 
 it 's not busy we have all our cashiers in and there has n't been many calls for specials 
 overall a pleasant morning 
 that is until miss alabama walks up to the counter <unk> out in <unk> and red carrying a very nice handbag with a such a sour expression on her baboon ass lips that you might begin to wonder if baboon ass was n't what she was tasting 
 in her hand she is holding a small statue that i had helped my assistant manager research online just that morning 
 it was a smallish sculpture by some famous artist that was worth a good $ 200 
 it <unk> a man being held up by angel jesus set on a wooden base 
 <unk> and old but we are firmly planted in the buckle of the bible belt 
 jesus sells here 
 we had a sticker on it for $ 24.99 
 i smile and ask her if there was anything i could do for her and she immediately snaps a quick yes there is 
 tell me how can you charge so much for something that y'all got for free '' 
 it took me a moment to <unk> an answer 
 we price our items based on their value '' 
 well it 's missing a finger '' 
 yes jesus did not have a right index finger anymore 
 that 's why it 's only $ 25 '' 
 that 's outrageous 
 and look at it 
 it 's dirty '' 
 oh the dirt is free '' 
 it was a bad attempt at making her smile or at least bring the <unk> in a bit but no dice 
 if anything it just pissed her off more 
 this is a thrift store 
 not an antique shop 
 you ca n't sell other people 's junk and charge this much '' 
 we do give half of what we make to charity 's name 
 and they have to pay us somehow '' 
 i 'm not paying thirty dollars for a broken knick knack '' 
 that 's actually insert name of piece by artist 's name 
 one just like it sold on ebay for $ 200 last week '' 
 i 've long since forgotten both pieces of information 
 baboon lips <unk> and her eyes narrowed 
 now i know her scheme 
 we have plenty of people who come to buy stuff and resell it on ebay 
 it 's not new we do n't discourage it and in fact most of them are valued customers 
 one guy i 'll call joe comes in and buys up to $ 400 worth of shoes at a time to repair and resell 
 he 's awesome 
 this lady 
 i do n't like her 
 i 'll give you $ 4 '' 
 sorry our prices are firm 
 $ 24.99 '' 
 well then i do n't want it '' 
 she plants the statue down on the service desk and stands there expectantly 
 alright '' i said and put it in the 'go back box 
 her face <unk> through several varieties of indignant rage before she marched off 
 the regular service lady returns from lunch and i am free 
 a few minutes later i see miss alabama walking around with the statue again and she approaches the floor supervisor 
 the floor supervisor is a sweet older lady who is <unk> christian but with just enough sass to make her one of my favorite coworkers 
 this did n't have a price on it '' she says sweetly 
 how much would you say this is 
 i found it over near the knick <unk> '' 
 so much lies 
 but i 've been in retail long enough to know going up there to <unk> her a liar is all forms of nope 
 so i just sit and listen 
 oh yes i remember this piece 
 such beautiful work 
 you know i love me some jesus '' 
 she says this all the time but it 's still funny when she says it to customers 
 too bad it 's busted and so dirty 
 so i 'll say ... '' she hummed and thought about it for a few seconds before turning back to the lady and saying $ 34.99 '' 
 the face of miss alabama baboon lips was so delicious 
 she looked like she wanted to start in on the floor supervisor the way she did me but bit back her <unk> and simply said oh ... well thank you '' 
 she marched up to the register and by the time she got up to check out the original $ 24.99 '' sticker had miraculously returned 
 i waited till she had left before going up to my supervisor and telling her about what had transpired between miss alabama baboon lips and myself 
 oh i know 
 best way to get people trying to scam you out of paying the sticker price is to quote them a higher one when the sticker goes <unk> 
 if there 's one thing i wo n't tolerate it 's stealing from those trying to do god 's work '' 
 tldr : have you found jesus 
 yes he 's down at the thrift store for $ 25 
 so i work at an internet cafe 
 basically its an internet gambling place 
 you sign up give me money and it goes onto your account which turns into points you can play these slot machine like games on a computer as well as search the internet but no one does that when you win points from these games you can come up to me and redeem the points for cash or use the winnings to continue to play the games 
 first off let me say we *do not* have a tip jar 
 no one is ever expected to tip us nor do i expect anyone to us no matter how big they win 
 there is *nothing* asking for tips or any sort of extra money for us as were already getting paid 
 we are allowed to accept tips if the customer gives us one which for me is awesome 
 there are very few tippers that come through my store but when they win big they tip typically $ <unk> $ 40 depending 
 so diner lady comes through my store every day 
 shes not a bad customer but i know her because she works at my favorite diner and typically leave her a good about half my bill tip since the diner is incredibly cheap so a huge meal for 2 is only $ 20 a good tip on that would only be $ 3 15 % i can only imagine how hard it is living off $ 3 tips when you have <unk> 
 this is assuming they get tips since ive noticed most people dont tip in my area 
 i mean i know all those tips probably end up in my hands anyway so i dont know i still like to tip 
 two days before this story takes place i had given her a $ 12 tip on a $ 20 a 60 % tip anyway today dl comes in puts on her normal $ 20 and plays 
 she <unk> really big and comes out with $ 400 
 wow great for her 
 she hands me a $ 20 and says thats for you '' i am always grateful for tips wow 
 really 
 you know you dont have to thank you so much 
 i really do appreciate it '' i always try to make sure they know how much i do appreciate being tipped since i dont really do anything that warrants a tip 
 she puts another $ 40 on her account and keeps playing 
 she <unk> that and puts more on 
 and more on and more on so on and so forth till i have her entire $ 400 back but she continues to play easily another $ 180 after that 
 thats when she comes up to me looking nervous ... dl so <unk> do you think you can put $ 20 on '' 
 me sure '' 
 and i wait and i wait and shes just looking at me 
 me im am going to need that $ 20 before i put it on your account '' dl oh well i was hoping you could put that $ 20 i gave to you on '' me what '' 
 dl i mean i just want my money back is that okay '' 
 i have quite a bit of freedom at my job especially to turn away customers when theyre being rude or if we think their bad for business so i can really say whatever i want with in reason 
 me you know you didnt have to tip me that was up to you '' 
 dl listen i just want my money back theres no reason to guilt trip me 
 all i did was change my mind 
 i dont want to sound like a <unk> but thats my fucking money and i want it '' she always whispers bitch 
 this isnt the first time shes said i dont want to be a bitch ... me okay okay ive got it right here its no problem i understand '' now i was pissed 
 i give her great tips all the time at least once a week <unk> to much more than this $ 20 and this was the first time she had tipped me even though shes won much more before 
 i never expected her to tip me i genuinely like giving good tips since i know it can make a servers day much better when <unk> been getting crappy tips all day 
 but as i said tips are up to them and not expected at all and if she wants it back then she can have it back 
 i reached into my wallet and pulled out $ 8 me here you go '' dl i gave you $ 20 this is only $ 8 wheres the rest of it '' 
 me i took my tip back 
 the one i gave you sunday 
 all i did was change my mind right '' she looked at me gaping and then left 
 <unk> this morning i got up early get some breakfast at the diner since my so was leaving for a week and we wanted to grab some food before his flight 
 i asked for another waitress today i know most of them by name now 
 dl saw the big tip i left for her coworker $ 15 i think the best part of this whole story is that she still came in and played today shes here right now except now she <unk> looks at me.this lady comes to my window - at the financial <unk> where i work - motions to an old <unk> flip phone hooked to her coat and tells me she 's a police officer 
 very quickly she says she needs information on checks and grocery stores because she 's working <unk> 
 she wants to know how checks work because apparently people have been going to one of them using checks to pay and then the cashier is asking for them to swipe their debit card and enter their pin 
 now there 's no reason for this so i 'm not sure what information she wants from me 
 i fetch my asst manager for her she flashes her cell phone announces her officer status and adds that she 's working with their customer service 
 when she explains her deal again and is asked what she would like us to do she says she needs a list of all the grocery stores in the area 
 well that 's not really our job to keep track of such things so we ca n't help her 
 she takes a few steps back says she 'll inform her chief and that my asst manager can expect to be arrested soon 
 suffice to say we 've never heard from her of her chief '' .i work for an international shipping store that can ship using the local postal services along with our usual shipping services 
 often people will pick the local postal services option because it is typically cheaper and get angry when they ca n't track their package on our website 
 this interaction happened yesterday between me m and angry lady al 
 & gt me m : hello 
 how can i -- & gt al : wheres my package 
 & lt spittle <unk> out of her mouth at the speed of sound & gt & gt m : i 'm sorry 
 & lt wipes spittle off face & gt do you have a <unk> here or did you ship -- & gt al : look 
 & lt throws shipping receipt on to counter & gt & gt m : ma'am we will try our best to help you but yelling will not help me understand your problem any better 
 & lt as i remove even more <unk> that has come from the fire <unk> this woman speaks through & gt & gt al : & lt picks up receipt and waves it in my face & gt i ca n't track my package and you said it would get there on 2 days prior 
 & lt she is waving her hands as if she is <unk> the ignorant walnut band & gt & gt m : alright 
 your receipt says you sent it local postal service express 
 & lt points to line on receipt that says local postal service express & gt & gt al : you expect me to read the receipt 
 & lt waves her hands for the ignorant walnut 's second set & gt & gt m : <unk> yes ma'am 
 reading is a good skill to <unk> & lt i give a sensible chuckle & gt & lt other people in line chuckle as well & gt & gt al : are you laughing at me 
 & lt looks <unk> at us <unk> & gt & gt m : no mam 
 however i just tracked your package and it was marked delivered 2 days prior 
 & gt al : it is not there though 
 & lt <unk> used water gun & gt & lt employee is unfazed & gt & gt m : unfortunately because you did not use one of our services you will have to contact local postal center 
 give them this number 
 & lt <unk> tracking number & gt & gt al : this is <unk> 
 i ai n't doing that 
 <unk> & gt m : if you ever would like to find your package you will have to contact them 
 & lt smiles to prevent my rage from spewing back into her face & gt & gt al : fine 
 but i 'm never coming back here 
 & lt storms off with her face <unk> like a busted pipe & gt & gt m : no problem 
 have a nice day 
 & lt <unk> off to post story online for internet points & gt edit : internet points and reddit gold 
 maybe she was n't so bad 
 edit2 : til how to spell ma'am 
 thanks <unk> and <unk> 's a tl : dr at the bottom 
 i do n't put them on top because it feels like spoilers 
 this is a story from many years ago 
 i have since quit this job and gotten a bit <unk> 
 in hindsight what i did could have cost me the job but it was worth the satisfaction 
 at the store i worked there was a policy that the person who is the lead cashier for the night is also responsible for restocking the candy 
 we would get <unk> and lows in the customers wanting to check out 
 if there were no customers around we were expected to do the restocking 
 at this point in the night there was a small <unk> of customers 
 myself and my coworker are ringing them out and i have a box of candy sitting near my register because i was the lead cashier that night 
 a small family approaches me 
 mother grandmother and two young children big sister 12 and little sister 9 
 while mother is unloading her basket of items grandmother goes to sit on a bench near the store exit 
 little sister and big sister chill out near their mother for a bit 
 while hanging out big sister grabs a piece of candy from the box i had open and pockets it into her jeans 
 no one besides me sees her do this 
 big sister and little sister go to sit on the bench with grandma 
 at this point i 'm conflicted 
 the child is old enough to know what she did and young enough to be whipped into shape by being caught 
 plus i like my job and she just stole from my store right in front of me 
 i decide to take action 
 as i am checking out her items i casually ask the mother is that your child with the brown hair sitting on the bench '' 
 when the mom replies yes i dropped my bomb 
 can you please have her pay for the candy she just took '' 
 my coworker told me later that it went silent after i said that 
 mother wants to assume the best so she calls over big sister and says this lady said you just took a piece of candy without paying for it '' 
 big sister - no i did n't '' me - it 's in the front right pocket of her jeans '' 
 grandmother reaches into the pocket and pulls out not only the piece of candy but about 5 other small items from around the store that big sister had picked up while wandering around 
 mother went livid 
 she told the child that they were returning all the things she had bought for her that day and that she would be in trouble when they got home 
 as big sister cried i handed the mother her receipt 
 it was satisfying to see the kid so upset over getting caught since i cared more about scaring the kid straight then i did about a $ <unk> piece of candy 
 tl : dr called a kid out for shoplifting 
 her mother decides to punish the child instead of talking to my supervisor about my behavior 
 so three days ago i had a young woman come through my line trying to buy some items with a check 
 it was not hers and declined it 
 she asked me why and i explained it to her 
 she apologized and was very understanding as the reason why 
 she said she needed the stuff so she was going to call her dad who was who the check belonged too 
 well about 20 minutes passed and her dad showed up 
 he was not as understanding 
 he starts off with trying to say he has done this before 
 i told him i was following procedure and was not allowed to accept a check from someone who 's name was not on the check 
 i begin to rescan all the items while the man made snide comments about me not accepting the check 
 such as there last names are the same and there addresses are the same and i just replied that last names does not mean direct family and the person had a common last name 
 also i never got as far as checking her id since the check had his name on it 
 it was that simple 
 as i finished scanning he handed me the check i denied and i asked for his id 
 he then decided to blow up and make a scene 
 he started screaming at me and calling me several names 
 i looked at him and just told him he needed to calm down 
 well as usual that just makes them even madder 
 he continues on and my supervisor takes notice 
 he comes over and i did not have to tell him what was happening as the guy was screaming about what i did asking for his id 
 the supervisor takes over and the man gives my supervisor the id 
 he runs the rest through and the man storms out screaming he was going to talk to my manager 
 the next day i get into work and my manager calls me to his office 
 the man was true to his word except he went a step beyond 
 he called our corporate office 
 the manager asked me about what happened and i told him what happened i did not accept the check from the woman and asked for his id 
 the man was causing a scene the supervisor took over and he said he was going to tell you about me 
 well corporate sent down to my manager that proper procedure was followed and requested investigation to see if i had done anything wrong 
 the supervisor was asked about the situation and i was in the clear 
 about half way into my shift the man walked into the door and sees me at the counter 
 he an agitated grunt and storms by 
 minutes later i hear him hollering 
 unfortunately i could not understand what he was hollering but then a few minutes later the manager showed up and told me the guy was mad because i was not fired 
 we began chatting and he stopped suddenly as he had a call on his earpiece 
 he left in a hurry 
 a few minutes later he came through with security and they were walking him out of the store 
 my manager stopped by on his way back through and told me he was screaming at some customer and one of our ladies in deli because the woman was waiting on an order and the man did not want to wait 
 the manager asked me if i would write out what happened with me for some paper work and he got the customers information 
 he was going to have the man served a no trespass order 
 i wonder how that is going to work out for the person who serves him 
 long time lurker of this subreddit first post etc 
 i actually have a pretty decent story to share 
 so some background : i work in a electronics retail <unk> 
 we offer <unk> damage coverage plans on almost everything including <unk> 
 this tale actually begins about half an hour before my shift 
 i arrived to work early in my normal <unk> clothing and am eating my lunch in the break room 
 a coworker who specializes in watching cameras to ensure people are n't stealing comes in the break room laughing 
 & gt <unk> you 'll never believe what just happened 
 i was watching the cameras focusing on this one girl who i thought was trying to steal an expensive phone case but she did something so much better '' 
 my coworker goes on to tell me that this girl was looking at those fancy phone cases that are supposed to protect your phone if it drops or gets <unk> in water and all that stuff she already had one on her phone but i guess she wanted to see the other ones we had 
 a guy came over and started talking to her and she begins to demonstrate the case functions using her phone as an example 
 she then lifts the phone above her head and smashes it into the ground 
 when she picks it up she realizes that her phone screen is shattered and it is not turning on so she begins to cry 
 so she gets in line to be helped with her phone 
 so coworker is telling me this and because i 'm still in normal clothes i decided i 'm going to carefully look at some things around the line she 's waiting in 
 when i walk near her she is sobbing <unk> 
 eventually one of my coworkers is available to help her and i could only get bits and pieces of the conversation but it started off with her saying she dropped her phone coworker knew of the situation beforehand 
 he then asked her if she had any sort of protection plan on it 
 she answers no but that she just bought it a couple of months ago and paid $ 600 for the total cost of the phone 
 coworker says that unfortunately there is nothing we can do 
 phones we are not allowed to exchange outside of the first 14 days so if it were a defect you would have to go through the manufacturer but because it is a cracked screen they will not cover it 
 the lady does not like that 
 she looks at my coworker and goes & gt '' i 'm going to sue you and this entire store for this '' 
 coworker just replies & gt alright but we do have a video of you smashing the phone into the ground '' 
 she looked he had slapped her but immediately turned and walked towards the manager 
 manager says & gt '' do n't bother i heard and saw the entire thing '' 
 lady just walks out 
 end edit : this is my most popular post ever 
 thank you guys 
 your stories are making my lunch break even better 
 its summer again time to come home and resume my shitty grocery store cashier job 
 backstory : i went to orlando with my mom last week 
 on the trip i first dropped my ipad on my foot and broke 3 of the bones on the top of my foot apparently you really can do that if you drop it just right 
 then two days later while i was getting off of the <unk> bus i completely wiped out and tore a ligament in my ankle 
 the same foot as the break 
 my <unk> is a thing of beauty 
 long story short i have a boot ankle brace and have to stay off my foot for awhile 
 my managers were super understanding they told me i could stay home if i wanted but as long as i can sit i do n't see why i ca n't sit at work 
 if i must remain seated regardless might as well get paid for it 
 so they got me a stool to sit on as i ring groceries 
 i 'm having trouble adjusting to scanning and bagging while seated so i am a bit slower than usual 
 but i am all smiles and trying my best goddamn it 
 - enter : grumpy rude asshat gra - & gt me : hello 
 did you find everything alright 
 & gt gra : you can stand to ring my groceries 
 & gt me : well i would love to but unfortunately i have broken my foot and have to stay off it 
 & gt gra : i think you 're just lazy & gt me : um no its really broken 
 i have a boot and everything 
 gra then proceeds to walk all the way around my register to look at my foot 
 which is indeed in a boot 
 & gt gra : well you can buy those at the store 
 you 're still just lazy 
 & gt me : alright well short of pulling up my x-rays i do not know what you would like me to tell you 
 i am not suppose to stand on my foot but would be pleased to ring you up while seated 
 & gt gra : i 'll go somewhere else he then <unk> his cart and walks out 
 what a grand start to my return to retail hell 
 i no longer work in retail but whenever we get closer to the holidays i always think of this experience 
 i used to work a a big box electronics store and every year like clockwork someone comes in a hour before the store closes on christmas eve asking for a new ds or ps4 or whatever 
 clearly the store is picked dry and i get to help this <unk> waiting until the last moment 
 when i tell them we are sold out the next words out of their mouth always astound me ... you just ruined my kids christmas '' 
 now by this time i am tired of christmas and all the people that really do not make it the most wonderful time of the year 
 thankfully our managers turned the other way in these scenarios and allow us to respond 
 excuse me 
 i did n't ruin anything 
 you did by waiting until the last moment 
 now is there anything else i can get you today '' 
 by that time they ask for a manager and they ask the same question and annoyed and upset that we ca n't make one appear out of thin air they storm out to try and <unk> another innocent worker 
 edit : my highest rated post on reddit ever and i have a <unk> error in the title : p. & gt & gt i used to work in a local store that was kinda like a big box store only smaller 
 last week the owners decided to do a 10 % off everything in the store promotion 
 but they did n't go about it the best way 
 first they did n't tell the employees about it until it was happening and customers were yelling at us about not getting their 10 % off 
 also they did n't put any extra people on staff because they did n't realize how crazy the store would get 
 usually on a 4 hour shift i might get 10 people total at my register 
 last week i was on register for 4 straight hours with people coming through no break and no slowing down of customers 
 so of course things were crazy all over the store stuff was a mess so the owners were asking everyone to work ot 
 some people were able to work lots of ot and wanted the money but i could only work a little ot because i 'm a single mom 
 my shifts were all <unk> around my kids school days and activities 
 on halloween night one of the owners asks if i can work ot that night and i said no because i was going to take my kids <unk> 
 she begged me but i said i 'm sorry it 's their favorite holiday and i 'm not going to make them miss it 
 also many of my young single coworkers who were with me told the owner they could stay till closing so they had lots of extra hands on deck 
 yesterday i walked in to start my shift and the owner told me to come to her office then fired me officially 
 she said they need someone more dedicated to the store and ca n't have me putting other things before my work 
 i 'm pissed off because money is going to be really tight for awhile but no store is more important than my kids 
 update : wow did n't expect so many responses 
 i applied for <unk> this morning and i 'm pretty sure i 'll get it 
 i did some online research and in my state they can fire you without warning for any reason 
 i do n't think i can sue because it 's not illegal 
 i will call the labor board to double check 
 good news is that the daycare center i used to work it has an opening 
 my old boss is still there and she said she 'd be happy to take me back 
 i have to do a formal application and everything but i 'm pretty much a <unk> 
 plus free daycare for my kids i 've been working at a grocery store as a cashier since march and was recently promoted to customer service manger with the new year 
 being both male and still in high school does n't fit the <unk> <unk> that had been placed at our store for <unk> but many of the customer are already used to it due to the fact that most of them are regulars 
 but there was one customer just call him joe who had a hard time accepting it 
 i get a phone call for the bakery and since our bakery was closed i told joe that i would take the order for him 
 it was a king cake and we ship them across country for those who ca n't enjoy them in their own states 
 **joe** oh 
 the bakery is n't open '' 
 **me** no sir 
 but i am more than capable of taking your order '' <unk> ** can you get a manager to do it 
 i know i have to pay over the phone and it has to be shipped so i just want it to go right '' **me** i am the current manager on duty '' **joe** no you are n't '' and then he hung up 
 about thirty minutes later i am helping out a new cashier at one of the registers when i heard someone ask for the customer service manager and heard them directed towards me 
 i left the register and greeted the man and recognized his voice 
 **joe** hi i was on the phone earlier and i wanted to make a king cake order but i wanted a manager and they would n't get one '' **me** that was me 
 i am the front end manager '' **joe** no you are n't 
 where is your supervisor '' 
 i called my supervisor and the guy asks to make a king cake order 
 my supervisor responds by pointing to me and saying that 's his job 
 he is the front end manger '' 
 after my supervisor leaves the guy looks at me 
 **joe** i 'll do the order tomorrow after work '' 
 little does he know that i 'm the manager on duty for the next 4 days 
 guess he 's not getting a king cake ordered 
 edit : mistype so this story takes place when i worked in the garden center of a large grocery store 
 we were able to process all transactions through our register so many people would come to check out here as the line tended to be shorter 
 this was all fine and well except for one thing when people brought items with electronic security tags we were unable to <unk> them as our portable scanner had been left in the rain and ruined 
 this meant that any time an item with one such tag was purchased the security gate would go off and we would simply wave the person through as we had just checked them out 
 on a day in which the alarm had gone off several times i decided to discuss it with my manager 
 & gt me : so is there any way we can get a new security tag scanner 
 i 'm tired of hearing the alarm all day 
 & gt manager : we 've decided it is n't cost effective to replace it since you people keep leaving it in the rain 
 you deserve to have to listen to this all day and when we finally get a new one maybe you wo n't take it for granted 
 this set me off a bit as i had not even been employed when the the original scanner was damaged 
 i went to a party with my friends that night and began to vent about how dumb my boss was 
 i told everyone how we were going to end up losing more money from theft because it was so easy to steal from us 
 all someone would have to do is actually purchase one item with a security tag and stuff their <unk> with other items 
 when the alarm went off the cashier would assume it was due to the purchased item and wave them through 
 after two days off i walk back into work and see we have a brand new security tag scanner sitting on the counter 
 & gt me : so you decided to get us a new scanner after all 
 & gt manager : yeah we had hundred of dollars worth of stuff stolen this weekend from electronics 
 lp thinks they were simply buying an item or two through here and stuffing their bags since we have been waving people through the alarms 
 & gt me : oh ... you do n't say ... oops 
 customer was <unk> and we were getting ready to close 
 we ca n't say anything to them until a decent amount of time after we 've actually closed 
 it 's 15 minutes past closing time they 're still shopping 
 manager approaches customer 
 & gt customer : i know you 're closed but i 'm almost done picking out my tupperware 
 & gt manager : we 're closing the registers so if you 're going to purchase please do so in the next 5 minutes 
 our employees need to go home to their families 
 & gt customer : you work retail you chose this job you gave up the rights to have a family or spend time with them 
 if you want family time get a real job 
 what 
 just what 
 also she had spent quite literally over 2 hours looking at tupperware 
 we have 2 shelves of it 
 i do n't even know anymore 
 i 've been out of the retail game for a while but reading shoplifter stories reminded me of a very satisfying encounter that happened just before i left for my next job 
 our store had very little theft our inventory always came in within $ 40 of what was expected making us the best in company <unk> stores 
 best store got <unk> product so we took the theft that did occur very seriously 
 fortunately we only had one thief 
 she 's about 19 and apparently has a passion for socks and <unk> 
 we 've never caught her fully red-handed but we 've come very close so since we could n't ban her we would just follow her around and watch her closely until she left 
 occasionally she would bring a friend to try to distract us in which case two employees would team up 
 a week before i started my non-retail job i saw her for the last time 
 while i followed and watched her she turned sharply and asked why are you always right behind me 
 nobody else gets treated like this '' 
 i replied stone-faced nobody else is dumb enough to steal socks '' 
 she turned white and immediately bolted 
 according to my old coworkers they have n't seen her since 
 this remains one of my most satisfying moments in retail 
 update : one of my old coworkers is on reddit and saw this 
 apparently she was arrested from shoplifting for a nearby store about four months ago : i work at a <unk> center and we check in about 1500 people a day 
 people walk by the front desk and swipe a little key card to check in but if you happen to forget it at home we can look you up 
 one day a young man who 's name begins with dc so we 'll call him that comes up to the front desk 
 he was about 14 years old 
 **dc** hey i forgot my tag could you check me in 
 **me** yeah man sure 
 first and last name 
 *i checked the kid in and he went on his merry way 
 twenty minutes later a tall muscular guy walks up 
 tm * **tm** hey i dont have my card 
 can you check me in man 
 **me** no problem first and last name 
 **tm** *name of the kid who just checked in* *now we 're a really laid back center 
 if you dont have a pass and you just want to come in for that day 99 % of the time we 'll just let you in but we have a 0 tolerance policy on account sharing because of liability reasons 
 * **me** sorry looks like someone else is already inside under that name we can let two people im under the same name 
 nothing in the computer stops us or even alerts us 
 i just recognized the name because the other kid is a regular **tm** excuse me 
 i just got back in town nobody has my card 
 **me** they didnt check in with a card 
 it was by name 
 **tm** what did the kid look like 
 **me** im afraid i 'm not at <unk> to say 
 **tm** short black kid real tall hair 
 wears bright pink shoes 
 **me** im afraid i cant <unk> **tm** oh i understand but your face said everything i wanted to know 
 *he proceeds to yell down the hall toward the basketball <unk> **tm** <unk> a name that isnt dc 
 <unk> comes sprinting around the corner full speed almost knocking into an old man 
 tm drops his bag which i now realize is army issue 
 * **dc** youre home 
 they had a heartwarming reunion 
 there at the front desk 
 i went ahead and let them both go in and i set tm up with a new free membership and switched his current one down for dc to use 
 edit thanks for the gold edit i got 99 comments and i almost posted this as a comment ruining this joke.hello everyone first time poster long time yada yada 
 on to the story 
 during my junior and senior years of highschool i worked at a fast food place in my home town 
 working there for two years i have a lot of stories but today i 'll tell you about the guy who almost got beat up over a milkshake 
 on this particular night i was working on the front counter which included making all the <unk> items taking orders cleaning the lobby carrying out food etc 
 it 's a pretty slow night maybe three tables occupied one of which is occupied by my parents 
 they liked to come in and eat with me at work once a week or so they 're awesome 
 so i 'm behind the counter stocking and cleaning up when a man and woman come in probably late 40 's early 50 's 
 i do n't see any alarm <unk> on them besides the woman 's resting bitch face but plenty of cheery folks have that 
 anyway they order and the woman wants to substitute a shake in place of her drink 
 this is fine except that she only wants the medium size shake while her meal comes with a large 
 seeing as the meal comes with a large shake i can give her a medium but ca n't refund her the price difference 
 this is roughly how that goes 
 me : me dl : dumb lady dh : dumb husband 
 & gt dl : i 'll take a # 1 but i wa n't a chocolate shake instead of the drink 
 but instead of the regular size it comes with can i get one size smaller instead 
 & gt me : certainly but you should know that even if i give you a medium size shake i ca n't refund you the price difference so you would still be paying for the large shake 
 & gt dl : really 
 that 's pretty stupid 
 why do i have to pay for the large shake if i 'm only getting the medium one 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry ma'am that 's just the way the company does it 
 & gt dh : that 's stupid 
 we 're not gon na pay for a larger shake and only get a smaller one 
 & gt me : okay so you just want to stick with the regular large shake then 
 & gt dh : no she wants the medium size 
 just give it to her and give us the fucking difference 
 now remember how i said my parents were there 
 well my dad who is a rather large and intimidating looking man decides he 's had enough of some jackass yelling at his son 
 d will be my dad & gt d stands up with his <unk> death glare : look you son of a bitch that 's my son and if you raise your voice at him again i 'm gon na kick your ass 
 at this point the man woman myself and the other guests in the lobby are all in complete silence with my dad staring at this man 
 after about 8 seconds of this the woman quietly says she 'll take the regular sized shake they hand me the money and immediately leave after getting their food without a word 
 i never saw them again in my 2 years there.is long ... sorry i work for a prepaid cell phone company in a <unk> retirement town 
 i have a lot of regulars who come in to have us fix small problems with their phones how do i do this or this wo n't work ... or sometimes just to chat 
 they bring me small things occasionally like hair clips a book they wrote a giant pen for my kid 
 small <unk> as thanks for sitting down and explaining things 
 it feels good to be thanked and remembered 
 today takes the cake though 
 i had a customer come in friday to pay their bill and commented that their <unk> had bought them a <unk> fire and they had no idea how to use it 
 i told them i 'm an amazon <unk> and i have a couple of kindles 
 season ended so we are dead on sundays 
 come in i 'll set it up and walk you through using it '' 
 they tell me great see you then 
 they come in today and i go through everything 
 we get to chatting and they stay about 3 hours 
 at the end of my shift i 'm starting to wrap up and close down in 1/2 an hour when they ask if i ever take vacation as i 'm always there 
 i replied yeah when i get a chance '' 
 they say great we have <unk> 
 i 'm going to book a vacation for you 
 <unk> '' 
 they proceed to call <unk> resorts and ask what <unk> i would like so i said aug is my kid 's birthday 
 they paid for a 3 night stay for my son and me to celebrate his birthday 
 i am so amazed that someone would do that for anyone much less me 
 tl dr customer bought me a vacation.this will be a quick one but since this happened at the start of the weekend i 'm sure the stupid will keep rolling in 
 so i work in the electronics department of a big box toy store and i 've been in video <unk> electronic retail for about 5 years now 
 aka : i know my stuff this older woman comes over and has a handwritten christmas list and she 's looking for the latest football game on the <unk> 
 i inform her that the latest football game did not come out on that platform but she drops this 
 well my grandson knows this stuff inside and out so if he put it on this list it must be there 
 can you check the back '' 
 good lord a double <unk> 
 i let her know that i do n't have product in my back room and that i know for sure that the game did n't come out on the console 
 we go back and fourth like this for a few minutes to the point to where i 'm getting pretty snappy 
 i get very blunt this time of year happy retail smile turns into resting retail face 
 finally she says that her grandson is 9 and she 's for sure that he must be right 
 i finally just give up and tell her to try the big box electronic store and that they could probably help her 
 sorry fellow retail slave that she ends up with ... i 'll buy you a coffee <unk> just started this job it 's at a <unk> store 
 when we are in training we wear buttons that say <unk> so i see this younger guy give another guy money and points to tobacco then follows him to the register 
 the buyer <unk> for me and this happens & gt buyer : camel turkish royals please 
 & gt me : i need to see both of your ids please 
 & gt buyer : what why 
 & gt me : i saw you taking money from him and now you want cigarettes so please ids 
 & gt buyer : he 's 6'5 '' are you fucking kidding me how can he be a minor 
 & gt me : my best friend was 6'3 '' in ninth grade ids please 
 & gt buyer : give me my cigarettes 
 i proceed to ignore him and get the folks behind him 
 he leaves then comes back 20 minutes later in sunglasses and a <unk> 
 by this time the employees had been warned of him 
 & gt buyer : camel turkish royals & gt cw : hey <unk> you mind taking over my register locked because i need a break he proceeded to smirk because that 's not how it works 
 so i go over there and i stand there and act oblivious 
 & gt me : hello sir thank you for choosing generic gas station how may i assist you 
 & gt buyer with rage through <unk> teeth : camel turkish royals ... & gt me : certainly did you bring the other guys id this time 
 then he snapped & gt buyer with <unk> : stop playing me for a fool give me my cigarettes you damn idiot at this point my manager comes up scans candy cigarettes and puts them in a bag and gives them to him then points him towards the door 
 i think i 'll like it here.a really short one today 
 i had a customer come in and place an online order for a product we did n't have in-store 
 i was collecting her information when i asked her for her name 
 katelyn '' she told me 
 and can you spell that for me '' 
 i asked 
 she looked at me with an expression of pure disgust then asked you literally do n't know how to spell katelyn '' 
 pretty proud of myself for not missing a beat as i replied on the contrary i can think of about ten ways to spell the name <unk> right now 
 how do you spell it 
 first post 
 mobile 
 24 hour petrol station 
 late at night 
 it 's been a busy warm spring night and i 've been at the same night shift job for a year so my <unk> was empty 
 a customer walked in <unk> lined to the <unk> water boxes and proceeded to violently grab the top one causing the stack to fall over 
 he comes up to the register and throws the water on the glass 
 him : i 'll take this '' 
 me : are you going to pick up the other water '' 
 h : i did n't f***ing touch it you just f***ing stacked it wrong '' 
 now i 've had my soul destroyed by retail so i have no <unk> talking back anymore 
 i work by myself all night the managers love that i actually get work done i 've been held up i stopped caring a long time ago 
 m : well unless you pick them up i 'm not going to sell you <unk> 
 h : i know the ceo 
 i 'll get you fired unless you sell me this 
 m : do you know his number 
 h : yes 
 m : then here 's the phone use it to ring him 
 h : i 'll do it 
 m : go ahead the phone is right there 
 h : ... just sell me this f***ing water 
 m : no 
 he then <unk> out of the store leaving the water on the register and all over the aisle which i then went and cleaned up took all of 10 seconds 
 but i guess people who know the ceo do n't need to treat people like people 
 but they do n't get their water when they <unk> worked for a pizza place that ran these amazing coupons to try and get people in the door like 50 % off a large pizza or buy 1 get 1 free subs 
 of course one coupon per order '' was printed on the front 
 people would give us so much shit about that 1 coupon thing threaten not to pay for the food we had already made or get sneaky and just have everyone order separately so we just gave up and started letting people use all the coupons 
 well there was one family of bottomfeeders that would abuse the hell out of these coupons 
 they 'd bring in thier family of 8 with a handful of coupons and end up getting $ 80 of food for $ 40 and ask us for <unk> cause they were spending so much money '' 
 they pushed all the tables together in the dining room together make a huge mess never tip and never paid full price for a single thing 
 one day they arrived and started pushing the tables together everyone in the kitchen <unk> 
 but the owner was in this day so we had to try to <unk> the 1 coupon rule 
 they whined and bitched so the owner decided to handle it himself 
 he went out and made some friendly small talk and told the bottomfeeders he would let them use 2 of the coupons but if he let them use all 6 that he would n't make any money 
 i heard him explaining that he too had a family to feed and that he had the right to refuse coupons or service if he needed to 
 these monsters were hearing none of it 
 they all got up screaming that we were ripping them off they 're never coming back oh <unk> and they were going to flame us all over the internet 
 the father started talking lawsuit which we all had a good laugh about 
 he was pointing his finger at us on his way out the door as we were cheering he 's <unk> about his <unk> the district attorney and he said you ca n't afford to mess with me '' 
 i shouted after him '' well you ca n't afford a large pizza 
 i work at a gas station chain so as you can imagine i get my fair share of crazy <unk> 
 this happened about a month or so ago surprisingly not during this insane powerball rush 
 *it 's 5 o'clock rush hour people are <unk> into the store one by one 
 crowds are accumulating searching for shitty gas station pizza a man comes in with $ 200 worth of powerball ... uh <unk> & gt **me** : hello sir how are you doing today 
 & gt **crazy lottery man** : <unk> check these for me & gt **me** : oh we have a self checker so you can just hand me the ones you know are winners : he glares at me like i 'm scum 
 i can already tell this is n't going to be a good experience 
 & gt **crazy lottery man** : well do n't you get paid 
 & gt **me** : ummmm yes sir & gt **crazy lottery man** well then you can check them huh 
 & gt **me** i suppose ... i am accumulating a crazy line and the other clerk is no where to be seen 
 i really do not have time to check all these lottery tickets but i must comply 
 i go over to the machine scanning each ticket trying to organize and save the winners for my books 
 crazy lottery man looks irritated that it 's taking so long but he does n't look as irritated as all the customers behind him 
 i finally finish and gather the winning tickets 
 & gt **me** alight sir you have *starts counting out tickets* & gt **crazy lottery man** nope <unk> deeply* you missed some of my winnings start over at this point i 'm getting nervous with all the irritated customers waiting not so patiently and i 'm starting to feel a little bit of pressure 
 & gt **me** : <unk> ok *counts again until i come up with $ 36* & gt **crazy lottery man** there is no way that is right <unk> 'm tired of you people trying to short me for your own personal gain 
 you can count those again 
 i wanted to say look dude my paycheck will be the same no matter how much you win 
 i do n't give two flying fucks about your lottery winnings and i have no reason to short you 
 & gt **me** : *sighs* ok counts again and get $ 36 once again 
 crazy lottery man is turning red in the face he looks like he 's ready to <unk> me 
 & gt **crazy lottery man** : nope there 's no way that 's it 
 are you really that stupid 
 count again 
 i 'm irritated at this point and feel humiliated 
 luckily the other clerk has made themselves present and is attending to the other customers 
 & gt **me** : *counts again* $ 36 crazy lottery man is tomato red and fuming 
 & gt **crazy lottery man** : this is ridiculous 
 wow did you even graduate high school 
 you cant even count 
 did they just hire you to stand here in look pretty cause it seems like you ca n't do anything else 
 at this point i feel shamed and humiliated other customers are watching 
 i wanted to say yea fuck face i graduated high school a semester early with a <unk> and throw his lottery tickets on the floor 
 & gt **me** : would you like to count them sir 
 & gt **crazy lottery man** : i should n't have to but you 've left me no choice *he counts them aloud finishing off with $ 36* whatever just give me my money 
 i slowly count out all $ 36 
 time for another tale from my years in an upscale grocery store '' 
 so my name is a bit unusual 
 it 's an <unk> spelling of a common name 
 for example alternates of the name nicholas : <unk> french <unk> german <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> spanish 
 now my name is n't nicholas i 'd be pretty stupid to tell stories about my work using my real name would n't i 
 but that should give you an idea 
 i rather like the spelling of my name because i 'm named after my grandfather 
 i 'll use nicholas as the example in this story though 
 one day a customer looked at my name tag and asked a common question 
 & gt customer : how is your name pronounced '' & gt me : just nicholas sir 
 it 's the country spelling of the name 
 i was named after my grandfather '' 
 & gt customer : are you from there '' 
 & gt me : nope i 'm from the states '' 
 & gt customer looking slightly confused : oh i see '' 
 i scan a few more items of his then he speaks up again 
 & gt customer : have you ever thought of changing it to the american spelling '' 
 & gt me : no i have n't '' 
 & gt customer : well you really should '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry '' 
 & gt customer : you should really consider changing your name to the american spelling 
 it 'd be more polite to your customers if your name was spelled the right way '' 
 & gt me : your total is $ xx.xx sir 
 will that be cash or credit '' 
 yes the dude seriously wanted me to change my name because he was offended by a slightly different spelling 
 hello tfr i work in an internet cafe which is basically legal computer gambling under the guise of buying internet time 
 you get to play slot machine like games on a computer and are able to redeem the points for cash 
 so i recently go engaged to my wonderful so 
 he gave me an absolutely gorgeous diamond ring that i love 
 yay 
 onto the story 
 <unk> the store did my duties and took care of the 10 people who had come in 
 i began making coffee for myself only to find that one of my coworkers had neglected to empty the coffee pot from the last time he used it 
 it was old cold and full of <unk> not really just <unk> gross 
 <unk> 
 i poured out the old coffee and tried to clean it out using some clorox wipes 
 this coffee pot is weird its like a <unk> and the opening on top is really small and is really hard to get your hand into 
 luckily i have tiny hands but my ring and watch made it a pain to get my hand into plus i didnt want nasty old coffee on them so i took them off and placed them in a clean ashtray next to me so they wouldnt get knocked off or anything 
 some lady lets call her bfl for big fucking liar comes up to the door of my counter about to get a soda \ store layout to make a little more sense red is counter green is <unk> i took my hand out of the coffee pot and was about to reach for my rings to put them on when suddenly bfl starts going crazy 
 bfl : omg omg you found it you found my ring 
 im so happy ive been looking for it everywhere '' she starts reaching towards it and i slam my hand over the <unk> before she could get her <unk> hands near it 
 me : excuse me '' 
 bfl : my ring 
 that is my ring 
 im so happy someone found it you have no idea ive been looking everywhere for it '' i just fucking laugh the nerve of this woman 
 i mean i guess it takes some balls to claim something like that 
 bfl what is so funny 
 i want my ring or ill call the police '' 
 i put my ring on 
 and let me note this ring was bought from a private jeweler and a friend of the family in nyc where my fiancee and i are from and were <unk> away from there ... so this is not a case of similar looking rings this lady is just a thief 
 however i decided to have some fun 
 in my sweetest tone i say me do you have a picture of you with the ring 
 i cant just give it to you because you say its yours '' bfl well my phone is dead so i cant show you but that is my ring '' shes pointing at my hand me : whats the inscription on the inside say 
 theres no inscription on my ring bfl it says forever on it '' me : uh huh ... '' i stare at her holding back laughter 
 bfl well 
 can i have it now '' 
 now im just angry me : lady how god damn dumb do you think i am 
 this is my ring 
 a ring my fiancee got for me 
 it came off my finger and thats where its staying '' 
 bfl are you calling me a liar 
 youre just trying to steal my ring '' me : lady we both know youre a fucking liar 
 drop the fucking charade 
 get out of my store 
 that or ill call the police and they can decide whos ring it is and whos going down for attempted robbery '' i have no idea if if she could be charged theft by <unk> maybe 
 i picked up the phone and by the time i hit 9 she was out the door 
 she drove over the <unk> <unk> between my store and the freeway and sped off 
 she had left $ 80 on her account which i split between the customers a bunch of nice older ladies for having to listen to me curse and yell she has also been permanently banned duh tl : dr : liar lady attempts to steal my <unk> ring by claiming its hers 
 i laugh in her face 
 long post tl : dr at the bottom i 've been working in a large retail company for the past 5 years or so over the time i 've had a lot of scenarios where the customer is always right '' when they are absolutely not 
 this is one of them 
 i should preface this by saying the company i work for has a policy of in-store credit for returns without a receipt 
 if you have the initial receipt you can cash out the voucher if you cant find anything but without that receipt it is exchange only 
 whilst it 's usually used instantly to replace an item the customer has a 6 month window to spend their credit which is usually enough time given we sell everything from apparel to <unk> to <unk> to toys 
 after that time the note is <unk> and can not be used in a transaction and we have no means to override that 
 earlier this week i was placed on registers during a weekday it can be pretty quiet mostly stay-at-home parents and elderly i probably served 3 people every 10 minutes or so for the majority of my shift 
 i had a middle aged lady walk to my register and without being able to get a word in she slammed her item a bag of chocolate <unk> liquorice onto the counter 
 i proceeded with the standard how are you doing today 
 did you find everything you needed 
 have you got a loyalty/rewards card with us '' 
 speech and was warmly greeted with a i 'm paying with this '' waving a $ 95 credit note in my face 
 a little weird for a $ 1 bag of chocolate but no big deal she 'll just have $ 94 left on the credit note 
 i scan it through and complete the transaction 
 i then notice that the credit note says that it expires in two days 
 me : i should probably tell you this is going to expire in a few days 
 if you want you can go and find something worth $ 94 and refund it back to give you another voucher '' 
 customer : why would i do that 
 i 've just bought something with this so i have another 6 months to use it all '' me : no.. that is n't how it works 
 you have 6 months from when you returned items for the credit note spending a portion of it wo n't extend that time '' customer : i know what i 'm talking about i 've done this before at this store '' 
 i figured she may be right so i quickly confirmed it with my supervisor who told the customer and myself that there is no extension and the remaining balance will expire 
 the customer at this point was getting louder and more <unk> and started telling us both that she knows what she is talking about 
 me : are you sure you dont want to just grab any items and we can do a quick purchase and refund that way you dont lose your store credit '' 
 not exactly something we should do or usually offer but it 's a fair amount of money about to go to waste so we tend to make exceptions on that customer : fine refund the chocolates then '' me : that ... that 's not how it works '' customer : you said that you can just do a refund 
 refund the chocolates '' me : all that will do is give you a $ 1 voucher that expires in 6 months you 'll still have $ 94 on the other that expires in a few days '' customer : i dont care i know what i 'm talking about 
 just refund the <unk> '' 
 at this point my supervisor and i shared a look of disbelief that somebody could be that confused and told me that i should just do the refund like the customer has asked 
 so i did - i gave the lady a $ 1 voucher and told her to have a lovely day all the while reminding her that her other voucher is still close to becoming worth less than the ink on the paper 
 she left the store calling me useless not the best insult i 've had this past fortnight 
 cue todays shift 
 i was fortunate enough to serve the lady again who was a lot more pleasant today 
 this time buying a near trolley load of clothes which <unk> enough <unk> to $ 95 
 she handed me two credit notes 
 i could n't help but let out a quick smile and chuckle to myself 
 i looked at them and there was a $ 1 note and a now expired $ 94 
 i scanned the $ 1 first which went through fine scanned the $ 94 which immediately prompted on the screen expired - can not process '' 
 i knew that from here the pleasant transaction would turn 
 me : unfortunately i can not put this one through because it has expired '' customer : what do you mean 
 i was here earlier this week and i used it so i have another 6 months '' me : i did tell you that it does n't work that way and i tried to have you quickly purchase something so we could refund you another credit note 
 there is nothing i can do now that it is expired '' customers : where is your supervisor i want to speak to them '' 
 so i call my supervisor over who is luckily the same person as my first shift and remembers how everything went the first time 
 after being shouted at for what seemed like 60 seconds my supervisor calmly says maam we explained to you earlier that the voucher will expire and that you had an opportunity to receive a new note 
 you told us you knew what you were talking about and now there is nothing that we can do 
 the credit note is <unk> and void you need to pay for the rest of the transaction or leave and get your $ 1 credit note back '' the lady shouted several obcenities in our direction before leaving the store without her $ 1 credit note 
 she lost $ 95 
 there is always one person that thinks they know the job better than those who work it 
 there is only so much so can offer to those people before i let them have their way 
 even if it 's wrong 
 tl : dr - customer had <unk> credit note gave her option to <unk> an item for a new credit note did n't take it and loses $ <unk> happened many months ago but i just discovered this sub 
 in the shop i worked there 's two tills 
 as we all have to be <unk> for our tills only one can use the lotto till 
 i was on the one without it which has a sign saying no lotto at this till '' this tool walks in and shoves a load of lotto <unk> at me 
 i politely say & gt '' sorry lotto is just through the other till '' gives me a filthy look and goes to stand behind the one person who is being served 
 keeps throwing me dirty looks 
 another customer walks in 
 the tool sees him and says & gt '' hi hows you kit 
 kit goes & gt '' grand hows you pat '' 
 tool & gt '' grand you go on over there cos that <unk> one refused to do my lotto the lazy bitch '' kit & gt '' thats my daughter you just called a bitch '' 
 tool face falls and he looks sheepish and smiles apologetically 
 my da continues on 
 & gt '' did ya not see the fucking sign 
 <unk> <unk> do you have to deal with <unk> fucks like this all day '' 
 tool tries to talk to my da but is told to fuck off 
 i love my <unk> there was this terrible cashier at a grocery store i worked at 
 not work <unk> he always showed up on time volunteered to work more hours 
 he was just a bad cashier 
 16 years old had been hired to bag groceries for some reason they decided to make him a cashier 
 when they were training him he could never run the checks properly every single time he 'd end up having to grab another cashier or a manager to finish the transaction 
 <unk> <unk> that the receipt tape run out that would be a complete fiasco with him fiddling with the paper until someone with the bare minimum of patience would show up and push him out of the way to do it properly 
 he would freeze when confronted there was a big biker dude who did n't appreciate only getting $ 1.50 back for his $ <unk> pack of cigarettes 
 the biker may have been <unk> i was n't really paying attention but the cashier just stood there while the guy flipped out 
 the store manager came to the front and tossed the guy out of the store without the smokes 
 if this dumbass cashier could manage to explain how math works that situation could have been handled much better 
 his tills were always over 
 do n't know how hard it is to make correct change when their is a screen showing you the exact amount to hand over 
 then one day he got so stressed out by the line he accidentally gave away a full grocery cart away 
 the people tried to pay and he said that they already had 
 the managers finally figured out that this <unk> might not be cashier material and sent him back to bagging 
 also this cashier was me 
 i had jobs after that i used registers and never had issues 
 grocery store lines <unk> my young nerves along with counting tills damn money.i started my sunday shift at 11 so i walked in the main entrance at quarter to my uniform covered by my coat 
 in front of me is the largest dude i 've ever seen - six feet seven at least and built like he 's competing for world 's strongest man or something 
 he 's carrying a fridge and it 's as tall as me 
 yes this genius has just stolen a fridge and is hurrying out of the store with it 
 now when i say i saw this dude it was at the last second as he ran straight into me sent me <unk> and then tripped over me and smashed his newly stolen domestic appliance on the car park 
 i was out cold 
 six hours later i 'm out of hospital corporate policy and have absolutely no idea of anything leading up to waking up in a hospital bed 
 apparently i gave a full description of the guy to the police my name and address and apologised to my boss for not making it in to work on time 
 but seriously who grabs a fridge that 's as tall as i am and runs out of the store with it i 'm a manager for a high volume national drug store chain 
 i usually can <unk> any <unk> at the register fairly easily when wearing my shirt and tie 
 once a week on our truck day i ditch the shirt and tie and opt in for the more comfortable drug store shirt 
 people are so much more combative dismissive and much more likely to not even acknowledge me in aisles upon me greeting them 
 given the current retail climate of get your scores up or you 're in deep trouble '' i 've found it has helped me <unk> when dealing with low survey scores to not immediately point the finger of blame at my colleagues but rather acknowledge that sometimes a person just ca n't be reasonably pleased 
 i wish more managers would do the same and work on the front lines a little more i have found the experiences invaluable in my <unk> tfr i work in an internet cafe which is basically legal computer gambling under the guise of buying internet time 
 you get to play slot machine like games on a computer and are able to redeem the points for cash 
 now there are some people who dont always take the money they win off and leave it up there for the next time they come in and play 
 i typically recommend they take it off anyway in the event someone gets a hold of their <unk> info an 8 digit pin code and plays their money 
 this is where the trouble starts 
 a woman left $ 18 on her account to play at a later date i wasnt there for this 
 a month later she comes in to play gives me $ 2 and asks me to move the $ 18 from the <unk> space on her account to the playable space you get an extra $ 5 when you put $ 20 on 
 i inform her that she has exactly $ 0 on her account 
 i start going through receipts looking to see if anyone redeemed her $ 18 nope 
 i then ask her if its possible someone got her pin code many leave it at their computer when they leave for anyone to find she im naming her straws starts flipping out 
 straws : no i did not leave it someone mustve stolen it '' me : i mean i believe you that you left it up there but its not here 
 i was just trying to <unk> '' straws : it <unk> to be up there are you lying to me '' 
 me : no of course not you can see right here its zero 
 listen im really sorry its missing but i can put $ 10 on your account thats the maximum im allowed to give in a situation like this '' straws gets on her phone to confirm with the friends she came in with last time that she did indeed leave it up there 
 as shes doing this my awesome manager am comes in 
 i quickly explain the situation to him 
 he was about to pull $ 8 out of his own pocket when she came back up to my register 
 straws : i knew it <unk> remembers that other guy who works here mustve stolen it '' am : ma 'm i can assure you that my employee did not steal anything from you princess <unk> explained everything she put $ 10 on your account and im going to- '' straws : i dont give a fuck about $ 10 what am i going to do with that 
 dont you realize 
 i cant afford to lose $ 8 
 i need to pay bills you know '' with this little <unk> of anger she <unk> a container straws off the counter onto the floor then kicks it making like 200 straws go flying around the store 
 i truly expected my manager to be mad but he just starts laughing laughing so hard he can barely catch his breath 
 hes got tears in his eyes and hes doubled over laughing 
 straws is just staring in disbelief and honestly so am i. when he finally catches his breath ... am : lady youre <unk> me you cant afford to lose 8 bucks but youre in here gambling 
 you must have some messed up <unk> then '' he just continues to chuckle to to himself am : ill tell you what ill give you $ 20 to leave my store and never come back '' he threw $ 20 on the counter and walked off towards the office still laughing to himself 
 straws didnt even take the money she just bolted towards the door as red as someone could get without their head popping off 
 when am came back from the office still wiping his eyes of tears he gave me the $ 20 for dealing with that mess 
 this is why im picking up 200 straws today 
 tl dr : lady blows her lid over $ 8 im playing <unk> with the aftermath 
 edit : according to my co-worker who i just received a call from straws is currently in the building as of <unk> and trying to apologize for her behavior earlier today ... and also get that $ 20 she left ... unfortunately the banned list is written in permanent marker and im just way to lazy to rewrite i : so i work the register for a fast food chain 
 about a month ago i was put on 8am to <unk> shift which i dreaded because lunch was super fucking busy at our branch due to it being located next to a shopping center *and* a middle school anyway i 've been hating life since the new shift because of the non stop abuse from rude customers and parents who think they own you with their spoiled little brats who throw tantrums when the toys in the kids meal that they want are n't available 
 but what gets me the most is these asshole high schoolers that come up order a kids meal and try to draw a reaction from me like they want me to go '' wut lol a kids meal but you 're not a kid this is so random <unk> '' 
 i hide my rage with a deadpan mask 
 ai n't giving them the satisfaction 
 i treat it like any other transaction because it really is n't funny to anyone but them and the friends who watch them do it 
 but this story 's not about them 
 today as my shift was ending it was particularly quiet 
 one kid comes in and he looks probably 16 or 17. was n't sure at first <unk> he was pretty tall but the skinny body and <unk> was a <unk> of his youth 
 he comes up and asks for the kids meal and asks for a specific toy one of the birds from <unk> 2 in my mind i go ugh another one of these '' but something was not right 
 there was n't a group of snickering friends behind him or any trace of <unk> in his face 
 so i ring it up he gets his order and goes to sit and i think nothing more of it 
 i was staying overtime and there were only about 5 tables occupied so i decided to start clearing up some of the <unk> ones 
 i notice the skinny guy is sitting in the corner booth staring at his phone and not touching the meal 
 i get closer to him as i clean up each table and when i 'm next to him i ca n't help but notice that he 's crying 
 not like sobbing or anything but his face was flushed bright red and he 's constantly wiping tears and snot off his face between fiddling his phone 
 now i do n't have a bleeding heart for strangers but this guy looks really helpless so i ask him what 's up 
 just so you know i am absolute shit at comforting people so this was roughly our back and forth & gt me : hey are you alright 
 & gt him : no 
 & gt me : was your meal ... uh not <unk> 
 & gt him : i was supposed to meet my sister here 
 it 's her birthday and i wanted to give her this <unk> forgot the name because she loves this movie 
 & gt me : aw that sucks man 
 yeah being stood up is never fun 
 it 's alright i 'm sure you 'll get another chance to give it to her 
 & gt him : our parents are separate and they 're keeping us apart 
 we meet here some days because she walks home from nearby primary school and her mom does n't want her to see me or my dad 
 <unk> <unk> drive all the way here on her birthday 
 & gt me : sorry man 
 listen you 're a great guy and i hate to see you down on your luck 
 anything i can do to help 
 he keeps on and on about he 's texting her and apparently his sisters mom found out they 've been meeting secretly and decided to drive her to and from school so she does n't get another chance 
 from what i gather it 's his step sister because he never refers to the mother as mom - always *her* mom 
 and he says that he and <unk> dad are trying to keep in touch but the mom is having none of it 
 what a mess 
 i ponder asking him to describe her to me so i could maybe give her the toy if i ever see her we get a lot of students from that school but i did not like the idea of approaching grade 6 schoolgirls in the off chance that i 'd find the sister so i could try give her a toy as a favor her brother asked me like that 's not totally creepy 
 i 'm already a minimum wage earning loser that has no social life i 'm not going to be <unk> as a pedophile too 
 i sat with him for a while and he tells me about how they always got along and their parents used them as <unk> in their <unk> of a marriage and he and his sister always felt like they only had each other 
 like i said i 'm shit at comforting people so all i could ask was if he had anyone to talk to about it because i sure as hell would n't be able to help much 
 he says no and i end up giving him my mobile number and getting back to work because my super was giving me the death glare of why the fuck are you sitting down with a customer '' and i think that if i can help this guy even a little bit it could make a world of difference 
 i tell him to text me if he ever needs someone to talk to 
 3 hours since i got off my shift and i still have n't heard from him 
 i 'm sorry if this is a downer 
 i realize as i 'm typing this that there really is n't an ending here 
 but today i realized how trivial my misery was 
 just working at a fast food chain is shitty in itself but it 's a situation i put myself in 
 did n't do well in school <unk> attitude in college having no ambition but this fucking kid is in a world of hurt and he does n't deserve <unk> of it 
 i <unk> this sub a lot and i often see posts about being depressed or feeling like shit because of their job but in the end it 's *just a job 
 * you can quit you can try to do better 
 it 's not like this guy who has family life crumbling right before him 
 i 'm lucky to have my parents to call or my brother when i feel like <unk> out the misery of my job but what do you do when you 're <unk> is miserable instead of just your job 
 that was a lot longer than i wanted it to be 
 just a lot of thoughts circulating my head right now 
 definitely going to call my parents tonight 
 thanks for reading 
 edit : glad this is getting through to a lot of people 
 i was just happy to get this out of my system 
 edit 2 : please do n't take the self <unk> in my words too seriously i am really okay and this recent event has given me a wake up call 
 but still thanks for all the <unk> 
 **edit 3 : ** thank you for the gold and all the responses 
 currently at work and i 'm on my break but i 'll read all the replies when i get home later 
 **edit~ : ** double gold wow 
 thanks so much 
 by the way it 's totally normal for older people to have <unk> meals it 's just annoying when some of them make a big deal out of it or are obviously trying to grab attention by doing so 
 i 'm not judging anyone by their fast food choices 
 people asking for updates : there are none 
 but i will remember to post it here if he does text me 
 **edit~ : ** last night he finally texted 
 i do n't feel comfortable sharing anything more because it 's getting really personal and i am <unk> quite a bit of my feelings into this too 
 but just wanted to let you guys know that he 's probably going to be ok. thanks again for the unbelievable support this will be my final update 
 15/08/14hi 
 so this actually happened many years ago 
 i was reading some of the stories on this sub and was reminded about the nice employee who basically payed for $ 10.00 of my purchase for free 
 i was young 
 maybe 9-10 years old 
 i 'm not even sure how long ago this was 
 i had saved every little penny i got until i had roughly $ 180 
 when i went into the store i had a mission 
 i knew i was going to buy a ds lite 
 i was saving up for it for <unk> long 
 my mom did n't really support buying anything related to games so i left my mom somewhere in the store and went over to the electronics section 
 i walked up nervously to the store clerk and asked for a ds lite 
 thinking back on it i have to applaud him for treating me like any other customer instead of looking down on me because i was young 
 he politely went over to the case with the game systems and brought a ds lite over 
 he rang it up like normal and then waited patiently while i took out all of the <unk> wads of cash to pay for it 
 after counting all of my money i found that with the added tax the price of the ds was more than i had 
 i probably had the most disappointed look on my face because he took the money and took out his own wallet and payed for the remaining $ 9 and some odd cents 
 i ca n't forget the joy i felt when he did that for me 
 if you read this store clerk thank you for then 
 a little over a decade ago i worked in the limousine business driving clients on the weekends 
 i have many stories that range from strange to horrible and others being <unk> awesome 
 this is one of my more humorous <unk> ones 
 i pick up richceo from his house in an upscale part of the city 
 i 've already driven this guy earlier in the year and he likes to impress the ladies 
 he 's a bit of a <unk> pig <unk> and i know what to expect from him and how he talks about women in general 
 my instructions are to pick him up pick up his lady friend at her place drive to a <unk> and then open until his 5 hours are up 
 this unscheduled part of the evening is unusual but not uncommon for a regular client who 's used us before 
 lady friend lf is rather attractive and dressed to the <unk> in her <unk> <unk> dress and done up hair 
 nothing out of the ordinary happens as i drop them off wait around the corner and grab a bite to eat 
 i pick them up at hour 3 or so and richceo wants me to drive around town for a bit '' before heading home 
 he rolls the partition up and i 'm good with not having to make further contact 
 i know the best streets to <unk> around so i 'm driving around with no destination in mind 
 some time has past and i 'm not thinking about anything in particular when i <unk> the limo start to <unk> 
 what people do in limo 's is not my business but its still funny when stuff like this starts 
 everyone in the back always thinks they are going about this act <unk> 
 <unk> we wo n't be caught 
 * '' sorry drivers know.. every single time it happens 
 when your car is bouncing slightly its a red flag that the people in the back are <unk> <unk> 
 we are just discreet enough not to let on we know 
 first rule of the limo club 
 do n't talk about the sex they just had 
 limos have extra dark tint on the windows that have a one way mirror effect from the outside 
 the clients can see out but you ca n't see in 
 richceo and lf are going at it softly at first but seeing as how they are getting into it being discreet is n't their focus 
 i 'm traveling surface streets so stoplights are frequent every few minutes 
 while i 'm moving nothing appears out of the ordinary 
 come to a completely stop however it quite obvious something is happening in the back i 'm in the far right lane and i notice a cop car pulls up to me on the left 
 i normally do n't give them much notice but i glanced over and found them both <unk> neck turned in my direction 
 i fully look over and they have this whhhaaaat the hell '' 
 <unk> across their faces 
 i am just smiling and shaking my head with that hey its none of my business '' look 
 the light turns and we go another block or so and the cops are keeping pace 
 what richceo and lf are doing is not something the cops can legally pull me over for but i can tell they are up to something 
 i pull up to another stop light and the building off to the right that i 'm in front of has mirrored glass windows 
 the cops are on my left but have pulled back a bit so their doors and ** spotlight are next to the middle of the limo 
 i 'm at a loss as to what they are doing but what happens next has me doubled over with controlled laughter 
 they <unk> the spotlight at the dark <unk> windows of the limo and it <unk> through the vehicle hitting the mirrored building behind it and bouncing back 
 both sides now have light and this is basically <unk> the entire inside of the limo 
 the tint becomes completely ineffective as if looking through normal glass 
 the cops can see everything perfectly as richceo and lf are frozen mid-thrust 
 i look over at the mirrored reflection of the building and see the colored <unk> and topless form of lf scrambling to find cover and i hear ohh <unk> '' 
 coming from the back 
 the cops use the <unk> **please put your clothes back <unk> '' and i can tell the both officers are laughing their asses off as i look in the <unk> mirror 
 i 'm fighting back <unk> laughter as the two back are frantic to find their clothes 
 the cop car slowly forward and i <unk> them as they pass 
 and yes.. before you can think of a pun for this story the dude was <unk> 
 **tl dr - driving clients who decide to have sex in the back 
 cops notice the bouncing limo and shine a spotlight on them forcing them to stop and hide mid-thrust 
 ** <unk> : clarification and <unk> i mentioned i once had nearly an entire 40 person staff quit and as promised here is the story 
 names and a few details changed for everyone 's protection for setup i had been hired on as an acting store manager 
 basically for an entire six state region i 'd fill in whenever a manager was out of the store for longer than 48 hours vacation sickness <unk> etc 
 we were basically substitute <unk> of the retail world 
 this was only temporary and when a store manager position opened up i could step in with zero probation period 
 there were three of us in this role 
 i was the first hire of a rather <unk> new district manager callie 
 i interviewed her third or fourth day in the job and she was psyched about everything in the company and talked at length about her plans 
 of course all this ambition meant she bit off more than she could chew and within six weeks she was burning out 
 callie had originally planned to visit every store in her district over her first three months 
 but according to <unk> the previous dm knowing he was <unk> had sort of <unk> off so all the stores had issues one way or another 
 she ended up spending far more time at each location than she wanted 
 which is why she had n't made it to this one store i 'll call it store <unk> at all 
 so callie sends an email that she 's heading down to check up on them just before she leaves a semi surprise visit 
 we get an email not long after saying that she needs an acting store manager there asap asking for one of the two of us who were free victoria and i. not five minutes later there 's a revision 
 she needs both victoria and i. so knowing we 're heading in to disaster we each drive four hours to the store 
 walking in the place is a mess 
 not just normal retail mess but actual dirty windows literal dirt <unk> in the corners of the floor burnt out bulbs etc 
 callie is just sitting at the manager 's desk looking like someone hit her with a brick 
 she tells us that she walked in and the previous store manager jane handed her her <unk> and walked out 
 the only full time employee was gone too 
 and there was a lot wrong with the store 
 so victoria and i take over registers finish out the day and then the part timer hands in her name tag and says she quits 
 this was sadly just the start of it 
 that night we literally spent the entire night at the store 
 i ca n't tell you what order we found out the mess there but over the next few days it all unfolded 
 the old system in place was n't really <unk> between cash registers and accounting and there was a step in there where managers would transcribe numbers 
 it seemed that jane had been faking the numbers for cash 
 oh and the last four <unk> 
 disappeared 
 never taken to the bank and nowhere in the safe 
 plus there were these <unk> bins in the front with heavily discounted manager sale '' items marked as cash sale only 
 we puzzled over this for a while before finding that occasionally jane would mark shipments as coming in damaged and unsaleable 
 items which <unk> were the same as those in the bins 
 so cash fraud 
 great 
 then the next morning none of the morning staff showed up 
 victoria and i are running the store solo for a while while callie sat in the manager 's office <unk> through paperwork trying to figure out all that was wrong with the store 
 an employee shows up but just to hand in their badge and tell us to stick it up our asses 
 one of the weird things we had noticed was that there were far more people staffed for this store than made sense 
 jane had one full time employee then a ton of part timers mostly each only working 4 hours a week 
 this did n't seem the weirdest thing about the store but we later suspected she would n't have anyone there long enough to figure out things were shady 
 almost all of those employees were high school kids or people who were there to earn spending cash rather than a living 
 none of them were really invested in the job 
 when we finally had an employee show up she tells us the full time employee had called her and fed her this line about how jane who apparently was very well liked by the staff had been <unk> fired corporate was screwing them over and how they need to make a stand 
 if all of them quit the store would go under and they 'd benefit ... somehow 
 apparently a really good number of them decided the statement was worth more than the job and had decided to quit 
 callie ends up telling me to call the entire staff one by one and asking if they planned to continue employment 
 i spent an hour with everything from slammed phones to cursing to lame excuses 
 most talked about how they hated our corporate who was mean 
 and a few mentioned how corporate would n't even give them their bonuses 
 what 
 now end of year/christmas time all employees who had worked more than six months would get a visa gift card value <unk> on number of hours worked 
 i had n't heard of any problems 
 neither had callie who forwarded it on to accounting 
 meanwhile knowing that we had basically no one to work the store we sent out an email to the closest stores 
 if they could spare a few employees we would pay for their transportation meals while working if travel was more than an hour we 'd pay for a hotel room and they would have a 50 hour week at double normal pay 
 this was during summer when there were a lot of college kids so people jumped at it 
 by close we had locked in about 12 people from 6 or 7 different stores to work staring the next day and staying for at least 2 weeks 
 this in addition to the 4 or 5 part timers who had n't quit on us 
 meanwhile all day its calls from corporate from the corporate lawyers etc to callie who looks like she 's ready to cry 
 we get word corporate is sending two <unk> into town 
 again my <unk> is n't entirely straight here but in the next days callie finds out that all the bonuses were given out sent to the store signature required 
 all appeared to be redeemed 
 then later i heard all were redeemed at the same walmat ... oh yeah 
 jane had stolen from her adoring employees 
 we later heard from the next door sub place that just before callie showed up jane and the full time employee had been loading boxes in their car our of the store 
 wait thier '' car 
 oh yes 
 the two were dating 
 and who knows what they had just stolen 
 we also found over the next days that inventory was just a nonexistant thing 
 according to the system we had more negative quantities than <unk> and none of our stock was made from <unk> matter 
 we task a few employees to re inventory the store headed by victoria while i handle store operations and hiring a new staff 
 she finds out that there 's just boxes of stuff everywhere tucked in nonsensical places still in packing boxes mixed in <unk> 
 inventory was this nearly impossible thing as they kept finding stuff 
 a box in the bathroom 
 shipping boxes stacked in the backroom used as a table 
 a box stuck up in the damn ceiling tiles found by the <unk> 
 i 'm trying to retrain the old part timers meanwhile 
 some realized they needed to basically <unk> how the store was run and start over 
 others insisted that this is how its always been done 
 like layaway 
 our company did n't do layaway 
 we never did layaway 
 apparently jane did layaway but that 's wrong and i have no way of verifying what those customers spent 
 lots of confusion and issues forwarded to corporate 
 one or two employees just had to be let go because they insisted doing things jane 's way '' 
 the backroom had been a mess and i was <unk> man hours just to clean 
 cleaning up back there they found a door that had been covered with empty boxes 
 it was locked and victoria and i were <unk> whether it was ours '' or lead to the <unk> store somehow 
 then one of the part timers chimed in something along the lines that that 's the trash room they locked it up when it got full '' 
 now that employee was high school aged and i think this was her first job and she said it like this was a sane and logical comment 
 as though every business had a full trash room 
 so not really wanting to know the answer i asked what a trash room consisted of 
 apparently if it was raining or they did n't want to go out to the dumpster they 'd just throw their trash in there 
 callie had just sat down with the corporate guy when i walked up to the office and informed them of this 
 they both just stared at me like i shit in their <unk> 
 a <unk> was called in to open the door and we found a 15 ft x 15 ft room chest high full of boxes and trash bags and stuff 
 the only saving grace was it was closed up long enough to be not fresh garbage smell but old musty garbage 
 at any given point over the next few days we would have an employee wearing gloves and digging through it -- a bag of receipts kept for evidence 
 a bag of trash from the bathroom 
 a box of unopened merchandise covered in fluids leaked from a <unk> bag that may have contained food at some point 
 inexplicably a busted up bicycle 
 the employees would come up shell shocked on break describing the weird horrors they found 
 all this time i 'm hiring a whole new staff 
 normally we did background checks and a lengthy interview 
 this was shortened to my fifteen minute judgement calls on someone and can you start training tomorrow 
 as far as the thefts etc i ca n't tell you the end conclusion 
 callie and the corporate guy kept that bottled up but there were lots of calls to the lawyer 
 but the end result was that store needed a new manager 
 someone who could finish training the random new hires handle the pissed off customers who suddenly saw their store turned upside down handle inventory and of course the angry ex employees 
 thankfully they picked victoria and i went to my next less stressful <unk> of 
 so today was insane 
 i had an 8 hour shift and spent about 45 minutes not on the register 30 of those minutes being my break 
 it was crazy 
 having last minute shoppers always breeds rude ass people 
 i had this young guy in my line 
 he comes up i say hello he ignores me 
 i ask how he is he ignores me 
 i ask if he has a store card he gives me a short and rude no '' 
 okay then 
 he 's paying in cash and takes out his money to pay 
 he 's counting out the last of his bills and i politely hold my hand out to take it 
 he pauses looks at my hand and throws the money onto the counter at me 
 yeah probably one of the things i hate most that customers do 
 it 's just so effing rude 
 especially when i 'm holding my hand out and you look right at it and still act like a jackass 
 okay then buddy 
 call me a jerk for this move but i have no regrets 
 this guy is getting <unk> cents back in change 
 i print out his receipt slap it down on the counter and he holds his hand out for the change 
 ... so naturally i drop his change onto his receipt smile and say have a nice day '' 
 his face flushes with embarrassment and he mumbles a thank you 
 he spends about half a minute red faced and picking up his change 
 he wo n't look at me 
 i felt a little bad afterwards but like come on 
 you saw my hand 
 you decided to be rude anyway 
 so enjoy me being rude back while still smiling at you 
 maybe next time he 'll be nicer to the cashier 
 merry <unk> happened yesterday during a quite busy shift where i was solo on the <unk> 
 i had two customers in my line one i 'll call <unk> nightmare lady or rnl and the other i 'll call <unk> nice guy mng 
 to cut a long story short the <unk> wanted four refunds doing why she <unk> done them before i do n't know and i knew i was in for some fun 
 now our returns policy means that if you pay by card any refund will be put on the same card 
 this is printed on the receipts and is also displayed in store 
 the first two refunds no problem they went through straight away 
 but even though i was working as fast as i could rnl was <unk> impatient 
 she kept making comments like 'i ca n't believe this takes so long i 've got to pick kids up from school soon 
 and other <unk> annoying remarks 
 i gritted my teeth and kept quiet <unk> to mng in the process 
 then came the last refund 
 this is where it went wrong 
 the rnl did n't have the card for one of the refunds so i 'd had to give her store credit vouchers for that 
 i suggested to her that as she was doing this refund and buying items which would add up to just over the balance of her store credit voucher she could use this towards the balance and then pay a tiny difference of something like £1 
 she seemed happy to do this and so i did my bit with the refund put the new items though and then tried to scan the voucher through to adjust the balance 
 it did n't work and regardless of what i did to see if it would work typing in the voucher number manually different scanner angles even lying the voucher completely flat on the counter top and then scanning it to see if it was due to the paper <unk> 
 nothing worked and the rnl began kicking off saying i was terrible at customer service how this shop was terrible and all the usual stuff 
 eventually she decided to use a credit card paid and left 
 i was just glad she was gone 
 i then started serving mng whose query thank & lt deity of choice & gt was really easy 
 i apologised profusely for the wait and he was seemingly perfectly cheery about the whole thing waving my apology away 
 then he asked : & gt i want to speak to your manager 
 at this point i was panicking as i could n't think why he 'd want to do this 
 i was really hoping it was n't something i 'd done 
 i phoned the manager who was at the back of the store helping out with a delivery and she told me to send him down her way and she 'd speak to him 
 <unk> later and i got a call to my internal phone asking if i could come down to the desk 
 i got cover for the desk and went down panicking about whether it was some sort of disciplinary usually the manager does n't call you like this unless it 's something wrong 
 when i went down the man and my supervisor were sat at the desk 
 when the man saw me he got up pointed to me and said to my manager look you 've got a damn good cashier here she 's got the patience of a saint 
 i know i would n't have been able to do what she did with that woman '' 
 turns out the man had been singing my praises about how i dealt with rnl saying how professional and calm i 'd been 
 it made for a <unk> rest of my shift for both me and my manager 
 : long time reader first time poster blah blah blah 
 it’s long so feel free to ignore 
 i have always lived in the city but moved to a very small rural town last year 
 lots of farms <unk> and woods 
 i’m actually growing to love it 
 except for the community of rich entitled people who come down on the weekends 
 thankfully i do not work in customer service in any form so my contact with them is minimal 
 i’ve had two very memorable encounters at the same grocery store both with the same amazing witness 
 first one – i was shopping on a friday afternoon a few months ago stocking up regular stuff as well as a planned party for my <unk> coworkers so the total came to about $ 200 
 i had been helping bag everything as it was being rung up 
 the clerk finished gave me the total but before i could move the woman in line behind me stomped forward swiped her card and punched in her pin then went back to <unk> on her phone 
 i just stood there for a moment looking at her 
 i finally said “excuse me ” she cut this glare at me and turned away 
 so again “excuse me ” and i get “i am on the phone god some people are so rude ” *you want rude bitch 
 * “i was just wondering why you paid for my groceries 
 not that i don’t really appreciate it.” her “what 
 i’m not paying for your shit 
 how dare you 
 what makes you think anyone would just pay for you ” me “well you just did ma’am 
 you swiped your card and paid for my <unk> her “it doesn’t matter when i swipe the card during the <unk> me “it does if she’s still ringing up my transaction ” and now we’ve got a problem 
 transaction is complete and yes she has paid for my $ 200 groceries 
 she actually got off the phone at that point 
 we get a manager over to try to figure out what to do 
 they end up deciding for the manager to do a complete return of the groceries to her card and then ring them up again so i can pay 
 and cue the bitching 
 she’s in a hurry her time is valuable this is ridiculous 
 so i toss in “lady at this point i could walk out the door 
 my groceries are paid for and this is a problem that you caused ” now the clerk had gone to another register and started ringing other customers 
 but there was a guy standing behind bitchy woman 
 he’s a solid <unk> or more just a huge guy 
 obvious biker 
 black leather t-shirt chains you name it 
 when i said that he cracked up laughing and said “wow you’re a cute thing but you are a little badass aren’t you ” the bitchy woman turned to him and said something about minding his own business 
 <unk> it lady <unk> the grizzly bear 
 what could happen 
 * and this <unk> face went from laughing to scary in a second flat 
 he told her “lady you need to just stand there quietly while they clean up the mess you made.” i don’t intimidate easily but even i was nervous 
 but then he smiled and winked at me 
 so the manager does the return and i chat with scary biker guy 
 he told me that he keeps telling his little girl that “it’s important to be polite but it’s also important to stand up for <unk> every time the bitch woman made a noise like huffed or <unk> sigh he made this little sound almost like a growl 
 the clerk offered to check him out a few times but he just stood there arms crossed a solid mountain of a man talking to me 
 finally the return is done and the bitch has the nerve to ask “so can i get checked out now 
 you are going to let me go first right ” i just said no and the manager started re-ringing my stuff 
 final dig – bitch started the *i am never shopping here again do you know how much business you are going to lose 
 * i glanced over her items and said “what thirty – thirty five dollars 
 oh my god they will have to lay off half their <unk> biker guy called me “little <unk> again and went to the next lane to pay for his stuff 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - i’ve run into this guy a few times 
 even met his wife and <unk> girl once who’s not much younger than i am 
 he calls me <unk> <unk> every time 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- then came today 
 i just needed a few things so i run in on my way home 
 i got to the store and there are signs everywhere 
 and i mean everywhere 
 both doors all across the front windows posted on several aisles and on every register – cash only – computers not working all purchases must be paid in cash 
 i’m good so i grab what i need and get in line there were only two open 
 in front of me is an older woman with a cart full of stuff 
 everything is rung up and she whips out her checkbook 
 clerk - “uh ma’am you’ll need to pay cash our computers aren’t working 
 there are <unk> woman – “i saw those signs you can take a check it’s the same <unk> and tried to hand the check to the clerk 
 clerk “ma’am i can’t take that 
 we can only take cash.” woman waved the check in the clerk’s face <unk> take it 
 it’s the same as cash.” and me “ma’am the only thing that’s the same as cash is cash.” woman “you stay out of this you filthy little <unk> me “what the hell ” and enter biker guy and wife – <unk> little badass i thought i heard your voice 
 how are you ” we chatted for a second and the woman is still shoving her check in the poor clerk’s face 
 me “lady seriously you need to pay with cash 
 they can not take a check 
 a check is not the same as cash.” woman turned <unk> <unk> caught sight of biker guy and slammed her mouth shut 
 glared for a second then says “so what would you suggest i do ” me “well there is a bank across the street another about a half mile that way another about that far that way 
 i would suggest you go get cash.” she grumbled and slammed things <unk> then pulled out a wad of cash with more than enough to pay for her shit 
 gave me one more glare and stomped out 
 biker guy <unk> the little badass i see 
 though i wish i’d called you little ass <unk> <unk> wife “she won’t get that reference.” me <unk> i do 
 it’s what <unk> called the baby when she was <unk> biker guy just roared and <unk> open his jacket to show me his walking dead t shirt 
 we ended up in the parking lot for a half hour talking about last night’s episode and what we thought was coming next 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i should mention with the first incident i did think after i left the store that i could have gone to the atm and pulled the cash to pay the bitch 
 but i’m actually glad i didn’t think of that so that i got to <unk> all her valuable <unk> 
 if you actually read all this thanks hope you got a laugh 
 and hope that the next bitch customer comes with a little badass and big ass biker dude 
 tl dr – bikers are amazing <unk> of little badasses who stand up to bitchy customers 
 edit fixed the typo they bug me thanks for catching it 
 edit2 
 sorry for the walking dead <unk> if anyone knows how to hide it please let me know 
 i did n't realize there were places that were so far behind us 
 and for those who went there i have a boyfriend that i moved to the middle of nowhere with 
 and big ass biker guy has a daughter about my age and a wife who is very nice but is a big ass biker babe who could snap me in half 
 he 's a great guy that i run into everywhere small town but mostly see at this store 
 thanks 
 so a few years back i was running a gas station inside a <unk> national park 
 gas station prices are always high and tourism prices are even higher 
 snacks were pretty average but if you needed a phone charger or <unk> cables it was gon na be pretty pricey 
 but that 's what you get for coming <unk> 
 so one day i have two guys pull up in their pickup 
 middle-aged white executive types who seem used to people bending over backwards for them 
 they need gas and they need a gas can so they can take a <unk> back to their generator down at <unk> creek 
 of course the people who bring a generator to a remote <unk> are my least favorite kind but what can you do 
 i grab the can and they scoff when i ring it up and it 's around $ 25 
 so they walk away and it 's no skin off my nose 
 i 'm happy to know their generator wo n't be running all night 
 about 5 minutes later they come back in and purchase a jug of windshield washer fluid 
 and then they start to pester my other customers asking if they can fill up their windshield washer <unk> 
 i 'm getting suspicious ... & gt me : seriously 
 you 're going to do that right in front of me 
 you have to know that 's illegal 
 & gt c : well we need something to put the gas in 
 & gt me : yeah i can sell you a legal gas can 
 but using that container is illegal 
 it 's so thin the gas might eat through it on your way back 
 it 's not safe for you or the park 
 & gt c : it 's my container now 
 i can use it however i need to 
 & gt me : you can do whatever you 'd like with your jug 
 good luck <unk> me to sell you any gasoline 
 & gt c : fine 
 we 'll just take it somewhere else 
 & gt me : of course sir 
 next gas station is 20 miles south over mt 
 <unk> 
 this was our favorite gag 
 all the stations are run by the same company and all the employees were pretty close 
 so whenever one of us had a difficult customer who insisted on driving to the next station he/she would just call that station and give them a heads up 
 then whoever was working the next station would repeat the exact same conversation using the exact same words if possible and offer that they were welcome to check out the next station at wherever it was they just came from 
 but this guy was n't having it ... & gt c : look we 're just going to pour this out and then we 'll just put a little gas in it 
 it 's no big deal 
 that is crazy illegal 
 we are in a national park 
 why did you come if you just want to run a generator and pour chemicals into the soil 
 but it 's also just so funny because i know these guys have zero power in this situation 
 & gt me in my most bored tone possible : sir if you pour out chemicals onto <unk> protected land i will have to call the law enforcement <unk> 
 their office is that building next door 
 i know what you 're driving 
 i know where your staying 
 and i know that there is exactly one road that you could possibly be driving on for the next 30 minutes 
 you will be arrested or heavily fined or both 
 you 'll also be removed from the property and will now have a federal record 
 & gt c : fine we 'll just return the fluid 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but we have a no return policy 
 enjoy your stay this happened when i was visiting my <unk> a while back 
 i went to my old store and saw a bunch of boots scattered all over the floor 
 being the nice person that i am i decided to pick up after the rude customers one of whom i recognized 
 i was listening to an audiobook while doing this 
 mid way through my clean up the lady who i recognize comes up to me and taps me on my shoulder 
 i take off my <unk> and she demands to speak to my manager 
 apparently she was trying to get my attention but i could not hear her over my audiobook 
 i was acting extremely unprofessionally by having my phone out 
 i explained i was actually cleaning up after customers like her who do not know how to clean up their own mess 
 oh and i do n't work here anymore.read a story earlier that reminded me 
 about 2 years ago i was working stacking shelves at a supermarket 
 we had large cages with stock on them that we use to break down the stock and stack the shelves 
 so i was in my aisle stacking away when a man and his family wife and 2 young girls enterred the aisle behind me 
 the man proceed to say get the f # @ $ out of my way stupid girl '' 
 i being a good drone smiled <unk> moved my cage and said sorry sir '' 
 when suddenly ... my guardian angel in the form of another customer came out from behind the rude man and said excuse me you apologise to this young lady right now 
 have you no shame 
 and in front of your kids too '' 
 the man looked shocked and ashamed then apologised to me before <unk> off with his family 
 i thanked her she told me i was allowed to stand up for myself then went on her way 
 hooray for customers that will stand up against rude people long time lurker first time poster 
 i do n't work retail currently but i have in the past and most of my friends are in the service industry thus i have little tolerance for over-entitled <unk> giving <unk> to people who are just trying to get through their day and make a <unk> and my being in the us not very many bucks at all 
 this past sunday morning i found myself - <unk> - inside of fast food chain looking for some cheap greasy crap to get me through a wicked hangover 
 needless to say i 'm not in the best of sorts however i 'm still able to eke out a smile for nice girl working the counter 
 she 's super nice gets my order down jokes with me about <unk> abuse <unk> a laugh 
 like i said cool as all hell 
 i 'm waiting for my nasty beautiful cheese and bacon croissant when a <unk> of <unk> storms into the door 
 she 's your typical tfr horror story : blonde skinny obviously wealthy late 30 's and to cap it off is sporting a giant cross around her wretched little neck 
 in the back of my head i knew shit was about to get real 
 bitchface : umm yeah i need another iced coffee 
 this one is too sweet '' 
 nice girl : i 'm so sorry ma'am 
 these things happen 
 i 'd be more than happy to help 
 wait : is that from our store '' 
 bitchface : no 
 i bought it at higher class fast-food joint in other state '' 
 i live right near the border between two states just replace my coffee '' 
 nice girl : of course ma'am 
 that will be whatever coffee costs '' 
 bitchface : i 'm not paying for it 
 i told you to replace it '' 
 nice girl : i 'm sorry ma'am 
 for one it 's not even from this chain and two even if it were the franchise company which owns this chain in other state is different than the one in here in this state 
 i simply can not give you free coffee 
 it 's practically stealing 
 however i will give you the senior discount on a new coffee '' 
 wicked good customer service there amirite 
 bitchface slams the coffee cup down on the counter <unk> a little proceeds to put her hand on her hips like a <unk> daddy 's princess and stares at nice girl 
 nice girl : ma'am ... '' bitchface : i 'm waiting for my coffee you fat cow 
 give it to me 
 now 
 is there something about that you do n't understand 
 maybe if you were n't a high-school dropout you would understand english better 
 i bet those racial <unk> for <unk> back there can understand me better than you '' 
 et <unk> and <unk> 
 nice girl appeared to be on the verge of tears 
 now again i 'm hungover 
 hell i 'm probably still a little drunk at this point 
 i must have been as that would explain what happened next 
 i snapped 
 stowsucks : look you f-ing c-nt 
 if there 's a problem with understanding here it 's f-ing yours 
 it 's not the same company 
 it 's not even the same goddamn <unk> state you <unk> '' 
 bitchface : do n't use that language with me '' 
 stowsucks : what language 
 c-nt 
 c-nt c-nt c-nt c-nt c-nt 
 now get the <unk> out of this store and leave the girl alone you c-nt '' 
 yeah i know real mature on my end 
 bitchface : you need jesus '' 
 stowsucks : your parents needed to have an abortion 
 unfortunately they were too f-ing stupid to get one because here you are '' 
 bitchface : i 'm so calling the police '' 
 stowsux : great 
 you can tell them i did this '' 
 and here dear readers is where i made a somewhat poor life decision 
 not one that i regret but very well could have regretted 
 i picked up her iced coffee ripped the lid off and <unk> her nice <unk> sunday church dress with the contents of the cup 
 stowsux : there 
 how do you like your coffee now 
 leave '' 
 i grabbed my breakfast from the counter walked out of the door calmly as a stunned nice girl and a <unk> bitchface watched me then ran like hell for my motor scooter and rode off before bitchface could catch my licence plate number 
 hey i can no longer wipe hamburger buns on my buns or spit in drinks so i have to dispense justice on <unk> asshats somehow right 
 tl dr : never mess with fast-food workers 
 a fellow patron might be a little <unk> take offense and ruin your day for doing <unk> my college years i managed an electronics store 
 we rarely had people nick our goods but this pair made up for it 
 one fine saturday afternoon a couple of guys walked into the store and instantly read shady '' 
 not just to me and the store owner mind you but to the civilians as well 
 one shopper came up to me out of kindness to let me know and i nodded 
 the show began : one guy tried to distract me and the owner with questions about the latest computer on one side of the store - while the other rather unstealthily started stacking stereo equipment near the front door 
 pro tip : <unk> and <unk> is best left done to the <unk> 
 everyone is watching 
 the pair is oblivious to their <unk> 
 if i could have made popcorn for the audience we 'd have covered rent for the day 
 finally the owner nodded me to the front 
 as the other guy was in the back preparing his next load i had the pleasure of noticing '' the random pile of gear near the front saying in a loud voice & gt whatever are all these boxes doing here 
 i had better restock them '' 
 and began moving them back 
 they left rather abruptly to laughter and <unk> work in a cafe that brews a certain brand of coffee 
 although we carry that brand of coffee we are n't that company 
 we buy it off them in large amounts follow a certain procedure sell it for their listing price and make a profit 
 a little complicated but not <unk> science 
 every single day half of our customers try to use the coffee 's gift cards 
 i explain i 'm sorry we only accept gift cards for our cafe not the brand of coffee we brew '' 
 usually the customer will notice the sign we have hanging on the register and say that 's right i forgot '' 
 or oh that 's strange but okay '' 
 or oh i 'm sorry just cancel our order then '' 
 yesterday i had a customer go insane over this policy 
 customer : what 's the difference 
 you get your money anyway '' 
 me : no i 'm sorry 
 that gift card was purchased from that coffee company 
 we are not that company '' 
 customer : well look at the signs everywhere 
 look at your cups '' 
 me : we do brew this coffee but we are not owned by them 
 we purchase their product for sale '' 
 customer : exactly 
 you have a contract 
 if you 're working with the coffee company and sell their product you must take this gift card '' 
 me : no ma'am that 's not how gift cards work 
 if you have a gift card for a restaurant and that restaurant happens to sell frozen food in the super market you ca n't use the restaurant gift card in the super market '' 
 customer : look i want to use this gift card '' 
 me : we do n't accept them but you can try and swipe it if you 'd like '' 
 she stood there and swiped four or five times 
 each time i would respond the computer says 'tender not approved '' 
 customer : well what does that mean '' 
 me : it means we do n't accept those gift cards '' 
 *edit : wow this story got to the top of tfr 
 thanks guys 
 * another story from the shop of fabric <unk> and <unk> 
 we have many regular customers some lovely some <unk> and a couple that are just horrible 
 it was one of those days where everything goes wrong and i 'd had enough when in walks this customer 
 now little background 
 last time she came in a few weeks ago there was some altercation between her and a coworker something about the price i think the customer spat the dummy and vowed to never return to the store again which was met with <unk> relief 
 so this grouchy old bitch b comes in and makes a beeline for me 
 right off the bat she 's being a snobby cow 
 & gt me : good morning anything i can help you with '' 
 & gt b : are the new fabrics in yet '' 
 last time she was in i had mentioned that i believed the new fabrics would be coming in a couple of weeks 
 & gt me : no not yet sorry '' 
 & gt b : but last time you said they would be in in a couple of weeks 
 it 's been a couple of weeks '' 
 & gt me : well i believed they would be in but they have n't come in our delivery yet ... '' & gt b : but *you said* they 'd be in 
 *you said* that '' 
 & gt me : yes i know but i was n't 100 % sure it 's usually in by now but i guess it 's running a little late '' 
 at this point she 's following me around the store raising her voice and jabbing me in the arm with her long <unk> <unk> every time she says you said '' 
 i have had a bad day and everyone in the store want to see the back of this woman so ... & gt b : last time i was in here *you said* ... '' & gt me : you know what 
 last time you were in here *you said* you 'd never return to this store again 
 so why do n't you make good on that threat and piss off 
 there 's the door go use it '' 
 stunned silence 
 what a glorious moment 
 have n't seen her since and i got a pat on the back from the boss for ridding us of such a nuisance 
 **tl dr if you threaten to never come back do n't be surprised if the reaction is a sigh of relief and a thank you 
 ** *edit : since it 's apparently of great interest to a lot of you i 'm australian : d <unk> the dummy <unk> means throwing a tantrum and i 'm happy to be a hero as long as i get a cool name and an awesome mask to protect my identity : <unk> i worked at a gas station once upon a time and i was on break sitting behind the counter while my co-worker was on the till 
 it was a semi-busy day and since we were working in british <unk> we were just adjusting to the new law where people had to prepay for their gas before pumping it 
 sadly different gas stations had different methods for this so it could get a little confusing for customers 
 this guy came in walked in front of the line and put his credit card on the counter expecting us to turn on the pump for him while we kept his credit card as <unk> then started to leave to go pump gas 
 my co-worker called out for him to stop and come back for a second then she explained that we actually needed to run his credit card through our machine before we could turn on the gas pump because that 's just how our computer system was programmed 
 she told him he would have to wait in line and prepay like the other customers were doing 
 this guy decides to take it personally and says just turn on the damn pump '' 
 and tosses his credit card at my co-worker 
 i get up off my stool walk over to his credit card on the ground stand up and fire it at him like a <unk> and loudly and firmly say get out '' 
 manager laughs co-worker hugs me man storms out back to business as usual 
 moral of the story 
 do n't mess with my <unk> the summer i worked at a photography shop 
 here 's an exchange that i had with a customer : incredibly late <unk> walks into the store **me : ** hello 
 how can i help you today 
 **ilc : ** i 'd like to pick up an order that i dropped off 
 **me : ** what name is it under 
 **ilc : ** tells me his name i look through the shelf that we keep all of the completed orders on and did n't find it 
 next i check the counter in the back where we keep all of the large orders and it was n't there either 
 **me : ** i 'm sorry but i ca n't find your order 
 when did you drop it off 
 **ilc : ** january 2005 
 i 'm trying to resist laughing **me : ** what 
 we do n't store orders for 8 years 
 you must have gotten a call about it when it was ready 
 **ilc : ** i live in california so i 'm not in the <unk> very often 
 i have n't been able to pick it up until now 
 my boss steps in at this point **boss : ** we have an option to ship you your photos 
 why did n't you use that 
 **ilc : ** you said that you 'd hold it until i picked it up 
 **boss : ** i would have expected you to pick it up in a few months 
 not 8 years later 
 **ilc : ** why do n't you still have it on file 
 **boss : ** it 's been 8 years 
 **ilc : ** if you do n't get me my order i 'm never shopping here again 
 **boss : ** you live in california 
 you 're never shopping here again anyway 
 <unk> looks angry and leaves 
 working as an assistant manager in a clothing store i have come across a lot of different people from the mother teresas to the <unk> <unk> of the world 
 and then there was this lady who did n't just fly over the <unk> <unk> but hit the goddamn tree 
 i 'm sitting in the back office of the shop on a rainy september day doing the weekly <unk> when the phone rings 
 **me : ** good afternoon shop name this is my name speaking how may i help you 
 **lady : ** hello yes this is mrs. cuckoo speaking 
 *i cringe <unk> because i know this lady 
 the type that comes in wants to try on everything leaving the place looking like a fucking <unk> just tossed a farm at it with nothing more than some item that was on sale 
 * **me : ** hello mrs. cuckoo what can i do for you 
 **lady : ** well i bought this t-shirt from your shop a while back but it has holes in it 
 **me : ** oh dear i do apologize ma'am 
 if you could come by the shop with the item and the receipt i am more than happy to give you a refund 
 **lady : ** i do n't want a refund 
 i want a new shirt 
 **me : ** that is no problem at all ma'am 
 if you could just tell me the product number 
 it should be on the receipt 
 that way i can check if we still have one in stock or whether i have to order one for you 
 **lady : ** i do n't have the receipt anymore 
 i threw it away 
 *now i have to mention that we have a 14-day return policy 
 we normally do n't take back items without a receipt but fuck it i was feeling generous and have n't we all thrown out receipts we thought we 'd never need at some point 
 * **me : ** well we normally do n't take items back without a receipt ma'am but for you i will make an exception 
 the product name should also be on the little label on the inside of the shirt 
 could you read that out for me 
 **lady : ** i cut out the label 
 **me : ** oh dear 
 **lady : ** well it was all itchy after i washed it 
 **me : ** after you washed it 
 **lady : ** well yes i washed it 
 took it with me on holiday so of course i had to wash it when i got home 
 **me : ** ma'am when exactly did you buy this shirt from us 
 **lady : ** somewhere in march i think 
 why is that important 
 it has holes in it 
 **me : ** ma'am that was six months ago ... **lady : ** so 
 **me : ** so you want me to replace a t-shirt you bought at our shop six months ago do n't have any receipt for cut the label out of put through the laundry and went on holiday with 
 **lady : ** well yes 
 <unk> sigh 
 * **me : ** ma'am i ca n't do that 
 i am willing to make an exception if someone accidentally threw out the receipt or if someone brings back an item a couple of days outside our 14-day return policy 
 i am not that difficult really 
 but you ca n't expect me to take back an item that you have owned and worn for the last six months 
 **lady : ** well why the hell not 
 *because after this long a time i do n't know whether you have n't been white water rafting with it 
 or maybe you have a weird <unk> for being covered in hungry rats 
 or perhaps you went on an <unk> to the north pole and encountered some polar bears 
 what the hell do i know 
 it 's not like our clothes are made of <unk> 
 * **me : ** because it is well outside of our 14-day return limit and because it 's been worn and washed ma'am 
 i 'm sorry 
 **lady : ** well this is just ridiculous 
 i am a paying customer at your store 
 i was very happy with this shirt especially since it was <unk> and now it 's already ruined 
 **me : ** well ma'am it also states on all our receipts that all reduced items are <unk> 
 **lady : ** how am i supposed to know that 
 i threw out the receipt 
 **me : ** i understand ma'am 
 maybe next time you could keep it in a safe place 
 it is really quite handy to save your receipts to prevent unfortunate things like this from happening in the future 
 **lady : ** do n't tell me what to do 
 **me : ** i 'm sorry ma'am ... i was merely suggesting ... **lady : ** are you suggesting that i 'm stupid or something 
 *yes 
 yes i am 
 * **me : ** not at all ma'am 
 i have accidentally thrown out receipts in the past too 
 i understand this is something most people ... **lady : ** i am not most people 
 i am unique 
 there is only one like me in this world 
 *thank fuck for that 
 * **lady : ** i will be calling your head office and file an official complaint 
 **me : ** you do that ma'am 
 would you like for me to give you their telephone number 
 **lady : ** fuck you 
 *hangs up* after that i sent a quick email to head office telling them about this woman just in case she did decide to call 
 it somehow got forwarded to the big boss in denmark who promptly changed his email signature to : name company ceo phone number email unique snowflake i never saw her in the shop again 
 **tl dr** lady tries to return item she has owned for six months then goes on to tell me she is most definitely not most people 
 i used to be a cashier and whenever a customer used a card we had to ask for i.d. it was company policy and we got into huge trouble if we got caught <unk> it 
 i was working at the register next to my co-worker sarah and we had a huge line 
 to be clear we sold tickets 
 this customer asks for about $ 200 in tickets 
 this almost never happens 
 the lady whips out her card and hands it to sarah who asks to see some i.d 
 the look on this woman 's face 
 you would have thought we slapped her 
 i 've never been asked for an i.d 
 before '' 
 she shrieked 
 i doubt that ma'am it 's always been company policy '' sarah responded 
 with a huff the customer shoved her i.d 
 toward sarah ... but the name on her i.d 
 did n't match the name on the card 
 sarah said so 
 the lady snatched her i.d 
 back pulled out a second one and flicked it back at her ... that one did n't match either 
 this lady had four separate <unk> with four different names and the same photograph of her by the way none of which matched the name on the card 
 the lady demanded to see a manager and i 'm not sure what he said 
 though she did storm off in a huff 
 i imagine he told her that it was company policy and if she could n't provide an i.d 
 for the card she could take her business elsewhere 
 i 'm still wondering why we did n't call the cops 
 **edit** to answer some questions : the manager on duty was 21 years old and the <unk> dude i have ever worked with 
 i 'm surprised he even spoke to her at all 
 i did not know he was the manager on duty at the time 
 the box office was very <unk> and unless we needed to do a refund the managers left us to our own devices 
 i was not the cashier who turned the matter over to the manager sarah was 
 i assumed she told him to call the police at the time 
 i did not find out that the manager neglected to do so until the next day 
 as i said she left in a huff so the best he could have done would have been to send the cops after her 
 i did n't even fully see this woman 's face i only overheard the conversation 
 apparently it is illegal to ask for i.d 
 for certain credit/debit cards 
 this is news to me 
 if the company knew this however they did n't care 
 they were pretty neglectful of most things including certain labor and <unk> laws 
 wow 
 thank you guys for all the feedback here 
 that is super cool 
 this was back in my teenage years working at a froyo place 
 so this guy order a large froyo with toppings 
 i make the order for him and hand it over to my coworker in the toppings section 
 he was a nice guy left a little tip in my tip jar so i decided to be nice and i say to my coworker in <unk> 
 give this guy lots of strawberries '' 
 the guy hears this and says do n't skim on my order i know chinese 
 i know you guys are always speaking chinese to rip customers off thinking we do n't know what you 're saying '' 
 lol what 
 this guy also had chinese letters as tattoos all over his neck and arms 
 did n't give the guy extra strawberries 
 i work at a coffee place and some locations are also an ice cream place 
 i used to work for one that also sold ice cream but it was entirely miserable so i transferred to exclusively coffee 
 anyway our night shifts were hideously understaffed for how busy we were especially during summer 
 we made our waffle cones in-store and to make a full batch that 's basically one employee sat in front of the waffle cone maker doing exclusively that for one to two hours helping customers if the store got busy while the only other employee scheduled was doing ... well everything else in the store 
 so oftentimes we did n't have time to make them but we had two other types of cones 
 people still had a <unk> to get really disproportionately angry about it 'cause <unk> customers 
 anyway 
 so this guy comes in orders an ice cream in a waffle cone 
 my coworker and i apologize and tell him that unfortunately we 're sold out and offer one of our other cones 
 dude stares blankly 
 & gt dude : you seriously do n't have waffle cones 
 at an ice cream place 
 i want a waffle cone 
 what are you gon na do about it '' 
 my coworker and i exchange <unk> looks and do n't say anything for a moment when the guy starts laughing 
 & gt dude : nah i 'm kidding i 'll take a sugar cone no big deal 
 people do n't actually get pissed about that do they '' 
 & gt me : actually yeah we 've had people literally scream at us about it before '' 
 indeed the only customer who 's ever made me cry in my three and a half years working retail was screaming at me about waffle cones 
 & gt dude : incredulous look you 're kidding 
 what the hell kind of sad life do you have when you have to throw a tantrum over ice cream '' 
 i wanted to hug <unk> the context i work at a large clothing retail chain 
 i 'm usually there most evenings and weekends and i interact with every customer who <unk> my path because it 's in my job description to do so 
 in reality like most of you i fucking hate the condescending treatment and constant complaints i get from customers on the regular and my mood improves <unk> the minute i leave as i try to forget everything about it 
 oddly enough i have three sweet sweet days in a row off this week 
 like a long weekend ... from <unk> 
 i feel almost human again 
 yesterday i was at the grocery store doing my weekly shopping after class 
 a middle-aged soccer-mom type of lady approaches me and asks do you work at store '' 
 not entirely sure how to respond i say yeeeesss ... '' with some confusion and <unk> in my voice 
 & gt soccer mom : great i do n't have time to go in today unless it 's worth my while 
 what 's the big sale today '' 
 & gt me : um i do n't know 
 i 'm not working today '' 
 & gt soccer mom : they do n't announce the big sales to you before '' 
 & gt me : no and even if they did it would n't matter because *i 'm not working today 
 * you can call the store and ask or check your email ... '' i start <unk> <unk> away toward the end of the produce section in the vain hopes of <unk> this dedicated bargain <unk> 
 & gt soccer mom : well you 've been no help to me good luck finding me coming back to your store 
 you 've just lost a regular customer '' 
 and stalks off 
 i added a bottle of wine to my grocery list after this exchange 
 moral of the story : if you work retail enough to be <unk> always leave the house in a <unk> 
 obligatory edit : thanks 
 it 's my first time getting gilded <unk> music store back when they were <unk> 
 possibly one of the best jobs retail <unk> 
 dad and young son storm the counter pushing through two patient customers 
 * '' i need to buy this now i 'm in a hurry 
 * sure mate 
 right after i serve these folks '' 
 * '' no i 'm in a hurry

 i give in 
 were n't you in a hurry '' 
 * '' sell me this ... '' * nope '' 
 * '' ... '' * dad leaves 
 son trailing behind looking embarrassed 
 i exhale tell the other staff i 'm having a smoke and head out front 
 dad 's still loitering and looks all shocked and scared and starts to walk away quickly 
 * '' how dare you try to fight me 
 in front of my son 
 * he calls back while rapidly <unk> with a few <unk> staring like i 'm some kind of monster ... i was working cashier at my job when a very <unk> middle aged obese white man with gray <unk> and teeth that were <unk> too tiny for his mouth stepped up 
 i opened my mouth to greet him but he spoke before i could say anything 
 so i heard that <unk> where i work only puts their prettiest girls on the cash register '' he <unk> 
 his rotting fish breath hit me in the face 
 what can i get for you today sir '' 
 i 'm not done talking to you yet 
 what do you think about what i just said '' 
 i ca n't really confirm any kind of <unk> against the company sir '' 
 ah so you do n't think you 're pretty '' 
 it 's not that at all sir 
 can i take your order '' 
 so you do think you 're pretty 
 the prettiest one here maybe '' 
 no not really '' 
 well i certainly do '' 
 thank you that 's very kind of you to say '' i said in as <unk> of a voice as possible 
 have you decided what you 'd like to order today '' 
 let me give you the phone number to look up my member card '' he breathed at me 
 i tried not to gag as i punched it into the computer as fast as i could 
 okay you have x y and z rewards on your card would you like to use any of those today '' 
 no but there 's one reward i would like '' he smirked and <unk> his lips 
 you have my number but i 'm not ordering until i get yours '' 
 my mouth opened in shock 
 i just kind of stood there for a few seconds while he grinned at me not really knowing what to say 
 sir she 's not an item on the menu '' the man behind him in line with his arms full of squirming toddler spat at him 
 either order some food or leave this poor girl alone 
 she 's just trying to do her job '' 
 the man huffed and stepped out of line tripping on the edge of the mat as he stormed out of the store 
 i gave the guy with the kid a free drink and a pastry 
 to all my future customers please do n't question my self esteem and then hit on me while i 'm trying to take your order in the middle of dinner rush 
 quick backstory : i 've been working at a grocery store for nearly 6 years now started when i was 16 
 the first four months or so i was a bagger then the managers had me <unk> as a cashier 
 this story occurred about a week after that training 
 guy walks into my line and in his rather large order is a large pack of chicken legs 
 it 's one of the last items i ring up and as soon as i scan it he goes off saying that the associate in the market had told him it would be a different cheaper price 
 he 's pissed so i apologize and call my manager but he evidently wants to go bitch at the associate who told him the price so he grabs the pack and starts storming off towards the back 
 with his order still sitting in front of me 
 with a line of about ten people behind him 
 i 'm not sure what to do but before i can do anything the <unk> lady who was behind him in line turns and at the top of her voice yells hey 
 get the hell back here and pay for your shit '' 
 chicken guy stops dead in his tracks then turns around and comes back 
 he starts in on this lady but he also starts paying for his order as i recall he wrote a check 
 he 's going on do n't you ever fucking talk to me like that again you do n't know who i am '' and she 's giving it right back i do n't give a fuck who you are you do n't walk off like that you see this line '' 
 it continues like that them at each others <unk> and poor me just trying to finish the order and stay unnoticed 
 finally his order finishes and he snatches his shit up and say i 'll be waiting for you outside bitch '' 
 she looks him dead in the eye and says in a <unk> unconcerned voice you go right ahead i carry a gun in my handbag motherfucker '' and then turns to me and as if nothing 's happened smiles and says hi there 
 could i have a pack of marlboro 's please '' 
 chicken guy slunk off quietly and judging by the lack of <unk> after the lady walked out quietly went home.this is a tale from the bakery in a grocery store 
 an old woman comes in to complain saying that we spelled her grandson 's name wrong on the cake and everyone was so upset but they still ate the cake anyway and she demands a free cake 
 that would be <unk> but 1 when we take orders we make sure to ask for name <unk> and 2 when the customer picks up the cake we show it to them first before they actually buy it 
 old woman says she was n't the one who picked up the cake gets more upset at us reiterating that the name was spelled wrong and so on and so forth basically not wanting to listen to any reason so we give up 
 the bakery manager comes out and says okay ma'am we 're sorry that your grandson 's day was ruined 
 we can make it up to him with another cake with his name on it '' 
 then the old woman hits us with this line i want the cake for next weekend and write happy birthday mom on it '' 
 and then she leaves 
 i firmly believe that this was a setup for them to get out of buying another cake for another event 
 so there have been a few stories on here recently about rude annoying and just plain mean customers getting what they deserve 
 i 'm gon na join in 
 this story happened a few years ago 
 i was n't the employee but rather just a <unk> 
 a friend and myself went to a local fast food restaurant and went to the drive-thru and got some ice cream 
 we decided that we 'd park the car in the lot and eat since we did n't want it to melt nor did we feel like going inside 
 anyway we got out and sat on the trunk of my car where we had a direct view of the drive-thru 
 suddenly this one gentleman with a woman as his passenger pulls up to the windows in a very nice looking convertible and starts making really derogatory comments to the employees in the windows 
 like really derogatory 
 what 's it feel like to have a shitty job '' 
 do you smell like french fries all the time '' 
 my salary pays for you <unk> to come here and work 
 i should get this food for free '' 
 yes that 's a ten dollar bill 
 have you ever seen one '' 
 even if he was joking it was really inappropriate and we felt bad for all the workers 
 so anyway he gets his food and pulls into a spot close to me where he begins to inspect the bag 's contents 
 i guess looking for one more thing to berate them about 
 suddenly the car that was behind him pulls out of the drive-thru and parks next to him 
 the guy in the other car shouts hey '' 
 the jerk looks over 
 we look over 
 and the gentlemen proceeds to throw his large vanilla ice cream with <unk> and m & amp m 's right into the convertible 
 it 's everywhere 
 on the man his girl the seats the <unk> everywhere 
 the man is dumbfounded 
 speechless 
 he looks over at the other man with an angry look and is about to say something when the other man says learn how to be a decent human being you f -- <unk> a -- hole 
 how dare you make fun of people for no reason 
 who do you think you are '' 
 the other man drives off 
 the jerk drives off still covered in ice cream 
 me and my friend are now speechless as well 
 we finish our ice cream and go 
 smiling all the way home.this is actually a positive story for once 
 i 'm a manager in a store that sells on top of what we normally sell baby clothes and various other gear and supplies for <unk> 
 i am not a manager for this part of the store 
 i know <unk> nothing about <unk> at all other than where merchandise is 
 i 'm a 24 year old man and an only child 
 my life consists of beer college classes and video games 
 that said a woman comes into our store while most of our associates over that part of the store were on break 
 she also only speaks spanish 
 no one in our store speaks spanish 
 as the acting manager this very quickly becomes my problem to deal with and i was expecting the worst 
 i did not get the worst 
 this woman had the patience of a saint and a personality to match 
 she could not have been <unk> to me despite not understanding a word i said to her and <unk> <unk> 
 she was pregnant and had absolutely no idea what to buy for her <unk> child and i had no idea what to recommend her 
 but we had common ground in one area : smartphones 
 i was able to explain to her very slowly how to translate what she was saying on google to english 
 so she would very slowly communicate through text in very broken electronically <unk> english her questions 
 and i would in turn do the same to spanish 
 this took a very long time but she was completely <unk> and borderline amused at how the situation was occurring 
 in the end she placed an order for over $ 2000 in furniture and i walked her through the store while she created a <unk> of close to 100 items for her friends and family 
 all through google translate 
 this might seem like a fairly insignificant story but being able to communicate with someone in a completely different world and truly help them out really made my day 
 i feel like i did something important tonight 
 i worked in a southern department store for 3 years 2 of which i was head lingerie <unk> and these are my stories 
 i first started telling them here and got told you guys would love if i shared so here i am : d i hope that link worked i suck at formatting i 'm sorry in advance if it did n't 
 i have copied my stories from the ask reddit thread to start off with so you guys do n't have to go back and search 
 <unk> <unk> & amp mannequin <unk> the most shocking to me was when this older couple <unk> came in <unk> of black and <unk> and booze more so the wife than the husband 
 the wife who had scraggly blonde hair missing teeth loose skin dripping everywhere from a recent weight loss and all around bad personal <unk> asked me to fit her for a bra cause it had been upwards for 10 years since she had bought a bra always willing to help i happily agreed 
 we go into the fitting room and before i know it she strips her top half and lifts her arms to reveal long and i mean <unk> <unk> <unk> hair so i measure her tell her size and she seems delighted 
 so i leave her in the room and i go select a couple bras for her once i leave the room i see her husband caressing the mannequins vagina and staring at its arse 
 i let it go and go on the hunt for bras while i 'm looking he then starts yelling quite loudly i may add at how much would i be willing to sell the pretty young blonde '' for 
 i politely told him they were n't for sale etc etc but he still kept asking caressing and even <unk> the life sized mannequin 
 so i smiled nodded and went back in to cater to his wife 
 when i got in there she asked since i had <unk> her bust would i kindly measure her waist and hips cause she 'd like to know once again i agreed with a smile 
 i was at her waist told her the number and she got so excited ya know cause of the weight loss 
 i <unk> down do reach her hips and <unk> 
 she pulls down her <unk> <unk> mum jeans to reveal her large <unk> matted muff 
 about <unk> in front of my face was this woman 's vagina she was not wearing underwear ... obviously i could n't do anything to upset her sensitive job and whatnot so i continued measuring around the <unk> skin trying not to touch anything i did n't have to and then the smell hit me 
 it was that old foosty musty old <unk> smell mixed with a fish market and some strong perfume 
 i held my breath and told her the measurement and stood up so fast i got a head rush 
 i then left her to her own devices to try on and went to get some sanitizer for my hands 
 of course the husband was still chatting up the mannequin but i just smiled and nodded at him and went about my business til she was done 
 tl dr old foul smelling couple comes in for a fitting husband feels up/molests the mannequins and i get face time with the wife 's vagina 
 trash can shit storm it 's my second week on the job getting the swing of american retail learning how often to say ya 'll '' so it 's going well 
 i 'm serving this adorable old woman she 's super nice gave her a coupon that i did n't have to give her she 's happy as a <unk> 
 she leaves the register and i turn around to get a drink of water and to look on the receiving bar which has loads of clothes on it to be put away but still in a good mood from awesome customer 
 i turn back around and that sweet little old lady is charging at me like a <unk> bull 
 her face is <unk> strained and bright beetroot red 
 i 
 am 
 fucking 
 scared 
 so scared i have to pee 
 i though i had made a mistake on her receipt as she is holding it high in the air with the other hand gripping her purse for dear life 
 i do n't know what to do so i freeze like a bloody deer in the headlights 
 after what seems like an eternity or this crazed woman coming at me she makes it to my register 
 i try to ask her how i could help her <unk> if i made a mistake and it 's obvious i am invisible to her 
 she does n't stop at the register she makes her way around it beside me pulls out the little blue trash can from my left <unk> up her skirt drops her tights and fucking explodes into that poor <unk> unsuspecting trash can 
 what do i do 
 i stand there staring at her looking <unk> 
 i have no idea what to do or what the protocol even is for a shit situation 
 she starts profusely apologizing and stating that she could n't make it the extra <unk> to the toilets ... .i come around to my senses get on the phone call a manager and page housekeeping 
 i felt so bad for the housekeeping women she 's so nice and funny ... we still used that trash can it even survived a store remodel ... it was still there to my left on the day i quit 
 tl dr sweet adorable old lady shits a fountain into my unsuspecting trash can 
 same trash can still there and in daily use 
 shameless <unk> 
 busy day 
 running around covering 2 departments cause we 're short staffed and <unk> manager is an idiot 
 carrying an arm load about 16-21 bras from the fitting room to my counter the lingerie department is a mess and i 'm all by myself as usual 
 in the middle of all the questions from customers calls on the phone passing comments of associates ... i see it in the middle of the <unk> around the store right in front of the bathroom entrance about 5 ft and inbetween my register and the home store register 
 a small slight asian man about <unk> unbuckling his trousers pulling them down along with his <unk> revealing his <unk> willy squats down and starts to poop 
 in front of customers and associates just keeps going 
 it is not a small pile i have horses so i know piles of shit this was a horse sized shit for a small sized man 
 his wife/older daughter 30s 40s 
 turns <unk> corner sees him and starts screaming at him and drags him to the <unk> with the trousers around his ankles 
 leaving the pile 
 so my manager sees and orders me to guard the tower of poop on one side and my coworker on the other 
 i am being paid $ <unk> to guard a pile of shit ... the smell is moving quickly and customers are freaking out but they are all stopping for a good 10 seconds a piece to stare and <unk> at the giant piece of fecal matter 
 it takes forever for housekeeping to show up but i am grinning ear to ear because my boss is a douche we <unk> all the time she is a moron 
 i do n't even care about the smell cause i am watching her hang onto a <unk> of guy fieri pans holding her nose and throat while <unk> 
 turns out the wife/older daughter was the bad guy of the story not the small man 
 small man needed the toilet they sent him on his way alone he did n't know where it was and not only that he 'd had a <unk> a day or two before and they had left him by himself in a place he did n't know 
 so he was n't all there 
 when they eventually came out of the bathroom they were screaming at him and he just looked like he had no idea hat was going on 
 so what 'd they do left him alone again and wandered off down to the ladies dept to check out the clearance & gt & lt i wandered down to check on the man but he 'd wandered outside 
 so being on the clock i could n't follow 
 tl dr guy shits on floor not his fault <unk> family 
 the birth of <unk> sling <unk> it was a slow sunday about 20 minutes before the after lunch church crowd usually comes in and i was dressing a couple mannequins in some bathing suits opposite side of the bra dept 
 so there i am elbow deep in some mannequin arse trying to hike on a pair of neon orange and pink bikini <unk> 
 for the record i am 5'2 and these mannequins are at least <unk> tall maybe more 
 so of course i look like i am <unk> this mannequin while i 'm really trying to make sure it 's arms and legs do n't fall off and that 's when i hear it 
 <unk> '' 
 i look up and the expression on my face can only be described as wut '' 
 <unk> 
 yo bra <unk> '' 
 i wave my hand and tell this voice i 'll be right with her and to give me a second 
 apparently a second is too long 
 she comes storming up through the swimwear racks and i get my first look at shamu 
 i say shamu not because of her size but the wave bathing suits are flying off her like waves off a small child 
 she 's about <unk> <unk> long neon green nails dew <unk> paired with a <unk> that appeared to be falling out leggings a black shirt that had cut out holes in the back and an arse that was as big as the boot of my car 
 she was quite a woman 
 i dropped the mannequin and smiled while cheerily stating my apologies for the wait and how could i help her 
 her reply went as follows is this where i get da tittay <unk> '' trying not to laugh i tell her yes and ask if she knows what size she needs 
 i dunno my tittay size but i do n't want you to be <unk> all up on my <unk> that 's wrong <unk> '' 
 so i politely tell her how the fitting process works and she eventually agrees and she leaves happily with her new bras 
 until a week later she returns with what i believe is her mother 
 and yells across the department heeey heeey das her 
 das her 
 the tittay sling <unk> '' 
 tl dr i am the tittay sling gurrl '' part 5 is now up part 6 is now up part 7 is up and is not going anywhere this time i swear 
 part 8 is now up i work at a beauty supply store 
 i like our products and we normally deal with pretty easy customers 
 but i 'm sick of the negative <unk> within the company and it 's employees 
 i 've wanted to quit for a while now but i 'm lazy and scared to make a change 
 this brings us to a few days ago 
 an old woman came in and was looking at makeup 
 i was trying to help her find a new foundation 
 we 're a beauty supply store but we honestly do n't have a great selection of makeup 
 we really did n't carry what she was looking for despite our best efforts 
 i recommended she try a nearby makeup store which has in-house makeup artists 
 she was delighted that i wanted to help and not just sell her something 
 this led to her asking about my life outside retail 
 i told her everything how i 'd recently moved to the big city what career i was trying to pursue etc etc 
 she starts encouraging me telling me how sweet i am i have an amazing energy 
 take it from someone who 's old get out there into the world 
 i can see you doing good things 
 i really mean that '' 
 i almost cried 
 it was exactly what i needed to hear 
 i thanked her profusely and we introduced ourselves properly and i sent her on her way to buy foundation 
 i 'm handing in my two weeks this sunday 
 edit : i have a second part time job and other <unk> of employment to follow 
 i looked at my bank account before deciding to quit 
 this is a short story about a woman who wanted her items in separate bags : so a woman came up to my register with two items : a <unk> pan and a pair of shoes 
 the following conversation happened : m = me c = customer m : hi how are you doing today 
 <unk> up first item* would you like these items in separate bags 
 c : of course i want them in separate bags 
 who puts a pair of shoes in a bag with something you cook with 
 how stupid are you 
 you walk on the ground with shoes you cook with this of course i do n't want them in the same bag '' 
 m : *finishes ringing up customer and putting her items in two bags* c *mumbles* ugh you stupid girl putting shoes in the same bag with a pan <unk> pays for items* m : have a nice day 
 honestly i went into the break room and cried for a couple of minutes because i was so embarrassed 
 i do n't get paid enough for <unk> have to say for every bad story i have i have at least one good one 
 wether it be an awesome customer or a fun moment with a coworker this is one of my favorites 
 i 'm currently running a register for the store when a guy comes up from the back with a large 60 '' tv and a coworker 
 <unk> : ** can you help ring this guy out 
 the registers in electronics went down 
 **customer : ** how is it that the electronics area at these stores always have technical problems with their registers 
 **me : ** hahaha trust me if i knew i probably would n't behind the registers 
 as we go through the process of ringing up the customer the tv is placed behind the register and out of sight so i can scan it 
 **customer : ** oh wait ... the customer grabs a soda from the fridge at the register and scans it just as another customer walks up 
 **me : ** okay that will be 602 dollars 
 **customer 2 : ** what 
 me and the customer look up and noticed the look on the woman 's face as the first customer gets out his credit card 
 **customer 1 : ** without missing a beat yeah 
 the price of soda shot through the roof last night 
 the stuff is like liquid gold now 
 he frowned a bit as he slid his card 
 **me : ** thank you sir 
 i slide the tv out and here is your free tv for purchasing that soda 
 the 2nd customer realizes what was going on and starts laughing 
 **customer 2 : ** i was gon na say 
 we all start laughing 
 tl dr : wise cracking cashier and customer fool a 2nd customer into thinking a soda was $ <unk> my job at the membership desk we were having a credit card sign up contest 
 whoever signed up the most people for credit cards over a one month period got a $ 20 gift card to our store which is great because i get a number of groceries at my workplace quite frequently 
 at the time of this story i was in second place 
 i had 18 cards done and my coworker had <unk> i was closing the last day of the contest and so it was just me behind the desk after six 
 around seven or so that night an older woman came up with one of our card application pamphlets 
 wonderful 
 i take her membership card and her license and begin the <unk> process 
 as i open up her file a young couple of about thirty comes up behind her also with a <unk> 
 <unk> 
 i was going to win this thing in the next five minutes 
 now here is where everything goes to hell 
 the old woman who was rather overweight and a little <unk> with me to begin with began to shift side to side 
 weird but okay 
 suddenly she lets out what had to be the loudest longest fart i have ever heard 
 it was wet 
 it was like in the movies 
 within a moment the smell reached me 
 lord have <unk> on my beloved nose i had the fight back a <unk> 
 i see the couple behind her get hit by the wave of odor and cover their noses for a second before deciding that staying in line was n't worth it and walking away rather quickly 
 meanwhile the old woman started feeling behind her and touching her butt 
 oh god no 
 with a brief sorry i have to go '' she took her license from me and left 
 and when she turned the leave i saw it 
 a <unk> wet spot on the back of her pants 
 this woman just <unk> herself right in front of me 
 but that 's not the worst part 
 when i looked down at the keyboard to exit her file i saw the spot on the counter where she grabbed her license from 
 there was a wet mark from her finger 
 to add insult to injury the sign ups were <unk> up the next day 
 my coworker won the contest by one sign up.in my small store mornings tend to be pretty slow 
 this day was like most others with just a coworker and i as well as an <unk> guest or two 
 during these times i do silly things just to keep morale up and make things interesting 
 the phone rings and i go to pick up after a couple of rings but by the time i do the person has hung up 
 i <unk> this as an opportunity to do a gag that i once saw in a looney tunes episode as a kid 
 me speaking to no one on the other end : & gt you do n't say ... you do n't say ... you do n't say ... you do n't say ... okay have a good day 
 *hang up* then my coworker with nothing else to do asks me what happened to which i inevitably reply he did n't say '' and get a deadpan expression from my coworker 
 then in the corner of the store some lady begins cracking up - like dying of laughter 
 i 'm not sure if it was the joke or the reaction from my coworker but it became one of those <unk> running-out-of-air laughs 
 i go over to help her and make sure she 's okay and i swear there are tears in her eyes 
 she manages to say no i 'm fine 
 i 'm so sorry '' and leaves the store i guess in embarrassment while she 's still laughing 
 i wonder how many people she has <unk> that dumb gag to since <unk> work in an office supply store that also sells technology 
 i 'm the only one working in tech today so i 'm just doing my rounds helping people out 
 i notice a lady standing by the tablets so i start to make my way over to her 
 next thing i know she lifts her arm and snaps her fingers like i 'm a dog and she wants me to go to her 
 usually that would make me immediately walk away but luckily she realized what she had just done and immediately says oh my god i ca n't believe i just snapped my fingers at you 
 i 'm so sorry 
 i ca n't believe i just did that '' 
 i say its fine and help her decide on a tablet 
 boring story but it was nice to have a customer realize that i 'm a person 
 not a dog 
 i worked at a telecommunications company a while back and just remembered this one 
 i was helping a customer put a screen protector on his phone in front of his two kids around 10 years old would be my guess and it was taking a while because i 'm quite anal and need to do these things perfectly 
 his kids kept <unk> me/their dad with questions like what 's he doing 
 why is this taking so long 
 i want to go to the pet store '' 
 can you hurry up '' 
 etc 
 i look up from the screen protector to the kids and say just so you guys know if you ask somebody lots of questions and tell them to hurry up it usually makes them slow down '' the kids kind of look at me and their dad says kids do you know what he just said '' 
 the kids shake their heads he just told you to shut up really nicely '' it absolutely was 100 % true and completely made my day 
 i discounted his screen protector because i couldso i 've been a shift manager at a retail store for about a year now but this happened about a month into my employment 
 we are about 20 minutes from closing on a freezing night in december we are talking below 0 freezing 
 when closing at this store there is only one manager and one cashier 
 i look out the doors and there is a cop talking to 5 teenage boys not my problem so i do n't concern myself with it 
 20 minutes later time to lock up close the last registers etc 
 i go and lock the door and see the police car driving away with the <unk> going then i see the 5 teenagers try to open the door i just locked 
 they knock on the door 
 & gt sorry guys we are closed & gt that cop said we could stay in here though 
 & gt well he should have talked to me about it before he left & gt come on man it 's freezing out here 
 & gt sorry guys nothing i can do felt kinda bad <unk> it was cold as fuck outside but it was just me and one cashier who was a teenage girl i did n't know why the cop was talking to them and i knew i could lose control of that situation if anything went wrong 
 also we were fucking closed 
 so i go about my business finishing the closing duties and then it 's time to go 
 step outside let the cashier go home and then i see the cop again who then proceeds to yell at me for not letting the teenagers into the store after we closed 
 i love retail 
 edit : real quick guys let 's be honest 
 the cop yelling at me was a dick move for sure but when he left his sirens were on so i assumed he was responding to a real emergency and perceived this as a non emergency 
 he probably did n't check the hours of the store unfortunately the kids <unk> from that 
 hell no i 'm not going after a cop for a misunderstanding 
 again dick move to get pissed at me but i got over that shit within 2 hours no need for anybody to lose their job or be reprimanded 
 i did my job he was trying to do his 
 that 's just how retail is and being a cop is probably far more <unk> should 've gotten enough attention i suppose 
 well there i was at work <unk> work stuff when a woman comes up to the register with a bag full of tools 
 they 're <unk> and clearly used 
 we 'll call her a you 'll see why i 'm not just using customer soon enough & gt a : i want to return these i look at the items and with my best customer service tone & gt me : is there anything wrong with them 
 & gt a : no i just did n't need them 
 & gt me : do you have the receipt 
 & gt a : no i just bought them like last month though can you just give me like store credit 
 at this point i actually tried guys 
 i do n't know why but i tried to find her receipt in our system hoping against all hope that it would n't be there because i 'm not going to be the one to return these and have my bosses asking me why i took back tools in such bad shape 
 i probably would n't have done it anyways but lo and behold there is no record of her purchase in our system 
 & gt a : so you ca n't take them back and just give me store credit 
 & gt me : i ca n't 
 especially in the condition these are in i would n't be able to sell them like this so i ca n't take them back especially without proof of purchase 
 & gt a : so you 're not going to take them 
 why do people think that asking me several times will change my answer 
 & gt me : i really ca n't 
 sorry 
 a packs up her <unk> tools and leaves 
 now i think this is the end of this and i go about my business 
 in walks b about an hour later 
 i 'm with another customer so a co-worker is helping him out 
 as i 'm ringing out another customer b is complaining to my co-worker that some <unk> '' refused to take back some good as new tools '' from his sister in law '' and just ranted and <unk> about how annoyed he was until co-worker calls a manager 
 manager takes b over to another register and gives him a gift card for his junk tools tells him this is a one time only deal and not to expect it to happen again 
 at this point i 'm standing casually at my register as b walks past me and says loudly enough for me to obviously hear & gt b : there was nothing wrong with those tools you smart-*** 
 wait til i see you outside 
 i stop and turn around half in shock that this guy actually just threatened to beat me up outside like we were in the 4th grade and i had looked at the girl he had a crush on 
 but i 'm not taking chances on this guy 's stability so i call up security 
 & gt me : yeah the guy that just walked past me on his way out threatened me 
 & gt security : he what 
 & gt me : yep ... said <unk> til i see you outside 
 because i refused to return his used products earlier 
 security hangs up and about 15 seconds later the head of security is storming towards the doors after this guy 
 the next part is hearsay because i did n't follow them 
 & gt head of security hs : did you just threaten one of my employees 
 & gt b : full of arrogant confidence yes sir 
 & gt hs : alright well i 'm going to contact the police and let them know how you feel 
 & gt b : still full of arrogant confidence go right ahead 
 hs comes in asks me again exactly what happened i explain the whole situation 
 manager comes over and hears story is appalled by what happened 
 the end 
 nope 
 this is where everything gets better 
 we did n't end up reporting it to the police 
 local <unk> do n't care about stuff like that 
 the next part is all hearsay as well but i heard it from both staff members present 
 a few days later b returns to the store to buy his girlfriend jewelry with his <unk> gift card because last minute gifts are a girl 's best friend 
 manager gets a call from jewelry about a man trying to purchase jewelry with a gift card that has no balance on it 
 yup 
 manager gets hs and they both head down to jewelry 
 hs approaches b 
 & gt hs : hey buddy you remember me 
 & gt b : yes sir & gt hs : yeah that gift card you 're trying to use is voided and you can go ahead and <unk> the premises now 
 & gt b : well ... can i at least have my tools back 
 & gt hs : no 
 & gt b : that 's bull & amp <unk> % 
 i wan na talk to corporate 
 & gt hs : go right ahead 
 & gt b : what 's their number 
 & gt hs : <unk> google it or something 
 b is escorted off the premises fans cheer the crowd goes wild and now security has had my picture on the wall in the break room as loss prevention and security employee of the month for about 5 months now 
 they choose an associate from the store who <unk> <unk> damage injury etc 
 and put them on the board 
 edit : well 
 this just became my highest rated post ever 
 glad everyone enjoyed it as much as i enjoyed it happening i worked at a grocery store at a full service meat counter - this means if you wanted any type of meat steaks chicken fish etc - not deli meats you had to get it from me behind a counter 
 this place was also in a fairly rich neighborhood so we had plenty of entitled customers 
 names have been changed in this article 
 this is a long story i 've been wanting to share for a while so apologies for the wall of text - this is the story of the woman who worked only one day 
 this took place right after a massive storm took out power all across town the town ended up without power for weeks and our store just happened to be one of the first places to get it back 
 this woman was a regular customer but was not our typical clientele - she was most likely living on welfare was very disheveled in appearance but not homeless and loved to come into our store 
 every time she came in she would tell the cashiers how she was constantly applying for a job here and once they gave her a job everything would be perfect and her life would turn around 
 after a few months of this <unk> we decided to help her and actually gave her a job - she seemed like a lovely lady and we were short staffed due to the storm 
 i was n't there when she was told she got the job but i heard she started sobbing and gave the store manager a hug thanking him over and over until she left 
 on her first day there was another small storm - this would be perfect for her as the rain usually keeps out customers <unk> traffic so she can learn the basics easier 
 however when the time came for her to clock in at 10 she was nowhere to be seen 
 we wondered where she was hoping she was able to make it here okay 
 ten minutes later nothing 
 fifteen minutes still nothing 
 twenty minutes we were really starting to get worried something may have happened to her 
 she finally shows up at <unk> looking for the working assistant manager kelly 
 kelly was meat manager 's wife and very good at her job 
 she usually trains the cashiers as she is also the manager of the front end 
 so as kelly is teaching the woman how to use our clock in system at this point we had one that scanned our hands and fingerprints to recognize who was clocking in she mentions to the woman the fact that she is 30 minutes late to her shift 
 the woman casually says she is not late and that she is actually perfectly on time 
 **red flag count : 1** 
 kelly then points to the screen on the hand scanner 
 kelly : '' look the clock here says <unk> you showed up here five minutes ago and all i did was give you your employee id '' 
 woman : '' ... well your <unk> must be <unk> wrong then 
 you should really get that fixed '' 
 **red flag count : 2** 
 so we work on getting her to a register to train her on the pos system as she is only supposed to be there until 2. at 11:30 she notices the younger kids who were there before here going on lunch break 
 she decides that this is a good time to ask when she can take her lunch break 
 woman : '' hey kelly when can i go on lunch '' 
 kelly : '' well actually because you 're only meant for a four hour shift company policy dictates you do n't get a break 
 you get 15 minutes with no punch out for 5 hours 15 *with* punch out for 6 hours and half an hour with punch out for 7 and up '' 
 woman : '' ... really 
 there 's no way i can go out real quick '' 
 she tried to give kelly <unk> tears and puppy dog eyes 
 **red flag count : 3** kelly : '' i 'm sorry maybe later though - you 've only been here for an hour '' 
 fast forward 15 minutes to <unk> where she once again piped up to kelly woman : '' kelly do you think you can hold the front end down here 
 i need to use the restroom '' 
 kelly agrees and the woman left to the bathrooms which are located in the employee break room 
 a few minutes later kids in the break room are reporting a terrible smell 
 after fifteen minutes the woman emerged from the women 's room with the <unk> smell of cigarette smoke 
 **red flag count : infinity 
 ** our store is a strictly no smoking area if you want to smoke you have to do it outside 
 kelly went into the ladies room to investigate the smell which had now started bleeding through to the meat department as seafood is right next to the break room and the woman had lit a cigarette enjoyed her smoke <unk> it out on the toilet seat melting the plastic and did n't flush it away 
 ** reasonably pissed off kelly brought the woman to the back room and asked her what that was all about 
 she explained she thought that kelly was being unreasonable to her and since she could n't take her smoke break with lunch she decided that it would be best to take it in the bathroom 
 when asked why she had to melt the toilet seat her only response was <unk> else am i supposed to put it 
 you guys do n't do the whole smoking indoors <unk> '' 
 knowing that she was aware of the smoking policy when she <unk> it was enough to force kelly 's hand into firing her 
 she <unk> with the store manager and he agreed 
 when they gave her the news her reaction was what we had more or less expected of her now : kelly : '' i 'm sorry woman but you 're fired 
 this is ridiculous you 've only been here an hour and a <unk> '' woman : '' what 
 no 
 and i 've been here *two* hours 
 i got here at 10 '' 
 kelly : '' you showed up at <unk> you <unk> store <unk> '' woman : '' because you 're being so unfair to me 
 i should have a break i 've been here long enough to get one '' 
 kelly : clearly very fed up with the interruptions now '' woman get out '' 
 woman : '' well where 's my paycheck '' 
 kelly : '' you will be able to get your paycheck next week on tuesday your time here has not been processed yet '' woman : '' **no 
 ** i **demand** my money now 
 i worked hard for it 
 you owe me <unk> $ 16.71 '' 
 kelly : '' woman you will be able to pick up the <unk> '' woman : '' **no 
 f # % k you 
 where is store manager 
 i want my $ 16.71 
 ** sm hearing the commotion left his office 
 he did n't need to ask what was going on the small store made it very easy to know what was going on 
 sm : '' woman you will not be getting any money until tuesday next week '' 
 woman : '' that 's against the law 
 you **have** to pay me '' 
 sm : '' just leave already - you 're lucky we do n't charge you for the property you destroyed '' 
 woman : '' well then where 's my form '' 
 sm : '' form '' 
 woman : '' so i can get me my <unk> '' 
 sm : '' get out 
 you 're not getting any forms you 're being charged for the property you 've damaged so you 're not getting any paycheck 
 leave 
 now '' 
 she left to her car peeled out all over the parking lot this could be seen because the entire storefront is glass and she drove in front of the store flipping the bird at everyone before she left 
 looking at the clock she did n't even last in retail past <unk> we never saw her again 
 tl dr - this is what happens when customers start working in <unk> have a couple of part time jobs 
 one of them is at a mom and pop convenience store that sells the hell out of lotto and beer 
 we also sell sandwiches subs and wraps 
 during the week we usually have a lunch special as well 
 during the holiday week we decided not to have specials because most of our regular customers had time off and we would n't have sold many 
 in walks a 20-something guy who is also a regular 
 he will often buy the normal menu items 
 so i was surprised by his reaction 
 him : what 's your special today 
 me : with the holidays being so slow we are n't going to have any until after new years 
 he starts throwing stuff on the counter for me to ring up without giving me any eye contact and says well that 's fucking awesome 
 i ca n't believe you do n't have any lunch specials 
 i do n't want anything off the regular menu 
 stupid '' 
 then he looks up at me and i said do you feel better now '' 
 oops he looks up at me takes a breath and says no but i 'm being a dick '' 
 <unk> 
 they can be taught 
 a friend told me this story 
 he works at a print shop in <unk> 
 & gt client : do you do lemonade 
 & gt friend : do we do ... lemonade & gt client : yes i was told that you do that here 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry we do n't do lemonade this is a print and graphics shop 
 & gt client : i know that i 'm not an idiot 
 i was told that you do lemonade here 
 & gt friend : i 'm sorry if i was rude but - & gt client : look if you ca n't lemonade these papers for me then i 'll go somewhere else 
 & gt friend : do you mean laminate 
 & gt client : that 's what i said 
 tldr : we do n't do lemonade but we do laminate 
 edit : sorry guys turns out my friend is a <unk> karma thief 
 here are some links to earlier threads : i 'll leave the post up for people that have n't seen it <unk> used to work in a home improvement store 
 this store will bend over backwards to take care of customers - even to the point of letting them walk out with product rather than offending them 
 customer called on the phone one night 
 cursing at me 
 her son had bought 3 gallons of the wrong color deck stain 
 she had stained <unk> square feet before realizing '' it did n't match the rest of the deck 
 of course it is my fault since i let him buy the wrong color 
 i offered to give her enough stain stripper to get the stain off for free 
 easy <unk> 
 right 
 customer service oriented 
 nope 
 she wanted me to personally come out strip her entire deck restain it and do it all for free 
 of course cursing me over the phone the entire time she explained it 
 i stuck to me guns and offered enough stain stripper to <unk> the situation 
 free of charge 
 i also suggested that next time she bought stain or paint we would have fixed the stain color for her if she had n't used 3 entire gallons 
 paint is clearly non-refundable 
 the label on the can says so 
 well according to her it was our fault that she sent her 16 year old son to the store and we sold him the wrong color 
 we were supposed to know that she and her husband had been in over the weekend and bought 6 gallons of a different color 
 she expected that we would associate her 16 year old with her - and sell him the right color 
 her husband then called and said the same thing 
 he at least did n't curse at me 
 he did hang up on me and you guessed it - went to the store manager 
 the store manager gave him 9 gallons of stain stripper applicators a refund of the previous 9 gallons and apologized for us selling them the wrong color 
 seriously i saw another thread on here earlier about customers assuming retail workers are stupid or <unk> because of the field we work in and it reminded me of something that happened a few years ago when i was working in my senior year of high school 
 i was working at a local chain bakery in a fairly upscale neighbourhood one saturday when this happened 
 for some backstory in our store our manager always told us to ask a lot of questions when people just asked for bread '' because otherwise customers had a habit of returning later and <unk> to score free stuff 
 i 'm not talking a <unk> of questions either it was literally stuff like seeds or no seeds brown or white bread thick or thin slice '' 
 and we always moved and worked while talking so we could provide fast service 
 one day i was working alone and this guy came in clearly in a massive hurry 
 he was the only customer so i was doing my best to be courteous and get his items bagged up quickly for him asking the usual questions when he looks up and snaps at me 
 are you fucking stupid or something 
 i just want a loaf of bread 
 you 'd better work on your customer service skills because it looks like you 'll be in sales for the rest of your life '' 
 at this point i 'm kind of in shock because i was honestly just going through the usual routine and trying to work quickly for him and no one had ever said anything like that to me at work before 
 never mind the fact that i had good results in school and was on track to law school i was totally <unk> about what to say to him whether to defend myself or just take it 
 that 's when this voice pipes up from over the man 's shoulder 
 it 's my english teacher and he says actually this cashier is a student of mine and in the top 5 % of her grade you absolute dick '' 
 the man looks flabbergasted slaps his money down on the counter and stalks off with his loaf of bread 
 i just looked at my english teacher and he smiled apologised for swearing and kept walking with his coffee 
 edit- there seems to be some confusion when i say law school '' 
 in australia you can go straight from high school to an undergraduate bachelor of laws 
 i meant my <unk> high school results were high enough to get me into my preferred university for that course 
 and yes the main point of contention for my story has almost nothing to do with my story ... classic reddit : <unk> coworker had what i think was a <unk> at work today i was the only one who knew cpr because despite my repeated <unk> for my company to hold classes on it it was n't cost effective '' 
 as you know it 's not really a living wage we earn so nobody could afford to pay for the classes themselves 
 edit : i just want to thank all of you things are in a better perspective for me today 
 went to work and spent time talking about my friend with coworkers and i feel more at peace 
 you 're all right even when we do everything we can sometimes it 's just not going to be enough 
 thanks again for making me see that 
 update : my son just came in here to tell me about this ... i want everyone to know how much their comments <unk> and caring have meant these two days 
 from all of your posts and advice i was able to say the right things to my friend 's <unk> when she came to see me at work today 
 i let her know that the last thing he heard before he completely lost <unk> was me telling him we loved him ... that i was holding his hand and <unk> his face and telling him it was going to be okay ... that he <unk> my hand back before he slipped away 
 that was all because of the strength you all lent me to get through the day 
 thanks for being you ... all of you 
 p. s. i 'm a woman 
 and a mom ... but today firstly i am a redditor 
 this story starts 5 years ago 
 i started working at a grocery store about 5 years ago and this elderly couple used to come in all the time 
 they were probably the sweetest couple i have ever meet 
 they would always come in the morning together john would buy coffee get the morning newspaper and head over to <unk> with the bakery girls 
 marliese and i would talk with me about things going on in there lives 
 after several months of working there i noticed that they had n't been coming in as often as they used to 
 one morning john came in by himself and i asked where his wife was he told me that she was n't feeling well and stayed home 
 i did n't think anything of it at the time 
 it had been another full six months till i saw them both in the store together 
 they did their shopping and come into my line to check out 
 i greeted them both john replied but marliese ignored me and was trying to find her checkbook in her purse and was getting upset when she could n't find it even though her husband had already written out his check 
 they argued over this and john had to take her purse from her 
 they paid for their groceries and left 
 later into my shift i was talking to one of the cashiers who has worked at my store for a very long time and who knew john and marliese very well i told her about <unk> strange behavior and that something seemed off about marliese she was usually always cheery and in a happy mood 
 the cashier told me that a couple years before i started working their marliese had been diagnosed with alzheimer 's and that is what 's probably going on with her 
 they would come in from time to time not as frequently as they used to 
 i would notice that marliese personality would get worse and worse she was very <unk> with cashiers and she started to <unk> a short fuse but we all knew what was going on with her so we all super patient and understanding 
 many months had passed and one day marliese came in without john and with who i assume was her caretaker 
 later on we found out that john had passed away 
 present time 
 one day marliese came into the store her caretaker drove her there and sat down in the cafe 
 marliese did her shopping and came up front to checkout 
 she went into this new cashiers line and she immediately started complaining about the price of something 
 instead of calling a manager over to fix the problem this new cashier decided he was gon na tell her that he changed to price to what she wanted even though he didn’t and he also double scanned some items on purpose 
 when she left he told me what he did 
 i immediately told my manager and my manager had to run out to the parking lot 
 my manager had marliese come back in and gave her a full refund with an apology 
 the new cashier was fired and <unk> 
 i work as a cashier at a place you need to buy a membership to shop at 
 i like this job a lot mostly because we seem to get a more pleasant class of customer than most retail stores 
 95 % of the people who come through my line are normal calm and understanding 
 so anyways a woman and her son who looked about <unk> came through my line 
 the woman kept complaining that her stomach hurt and at the same time the kid was keeping up a running <unk> on everything she bought 
 none of it was that entertaining so i kind of just ignored it 
 the woman is getting visibly annoyed with the kid 's constant talking 
 and then i scanned a can of tuna and all hell broke loose 
 the woman was at this point looking *pissed* and the kid said something like eat some tuna mom then maybe your stomach wo n't hurt '' the kid 's mom then yells ** '' if you had a girlfriend maybe you 'd be eating some tuna 
 ** i absolutely lost it 
 i was doubled over not even trying to hide how hard i was laughing 
 the kid did n't get it at all and looked really confused 
 the woman points at me and yells he gets it 
 he gets it '' 
 i was gone 
 somehow i managed to finish the transaction and send them on their way 
 i hope that kid made it to a burn center.so last night i was working customer service desk at a large chain grocery store and i had a bit of a line 
 i do western union money transfers and those tend to take a bit longer than most things i do 
 i had about three of them in a row and this guy was waiting behind them to exchange something 
 when i got done with the first two transfers fairly quickly btw the third western union customer wuc offered to let the exchange guy eg go first 
 eg said well i was going to exchange these chips for those pretzels but i 'm really annoyed at having to wait so long 
 you should just give me them both '' 
 and started to walk off towards the door with both of them 
 wuc stopped him and in his best <unk> voice said ooh does somebody not want to wait in line like a big boy 
 put those pretzels back '' 
 eg dropped the pretzels on the counter and walked out furious 
 as soon as i saw him walk out the door i told wuc that i owe him a <unk> and that i wished i was allowed to have that attitude with customers 
 got ta love the small <unk> man 
 it 's what makes the job worth it.i work in retail at a store aimed at kids so naturally we deal with a lot of kids 
 i 've seen a lot of horribly behaved kids and equally horribly behaved parents 
 one day a mom came in with two girls age 6ish and <unk> 
 they shop around the girls pick out about $ 75 worth of stuff that seem more like fun and cute clothes not <unk> 
 they check out and everything is great 
 mom is really nice kids are nice out they go 
 they come back in about 5 minutes later and come up to the cash register 
 i ask if they forgot something or needed something else and mom looks at the older daughter and says no but she has something to say to you '' 
 older daughter sheepishly says i 'm sorry i took this '' and hands me back a gift card she took from our display 
 they do n't have any money on them and i 'm sure they 've been swiped many times 
 i tell the girl thank you and take it back 
 mom then looks at the daughter who stole the gift card and says the golden words we also need to return these things 
 stealing is not allowed in this family '' 
 all hell broke loose 
 this girl threw one of the most impressive fits i 've ever seen particularly for a an 8-10 year old 
 boots on the floor coat on the floor throwing herself on the floor screaming bloody murder and how much she hates her mom this store everything 
 mom allows little sister to keep her stuff and is perfectly pleasant to us 
 i attempt to make small talk during the return while this girl is throwing the fit of the week 
 mom ignores her completely 
 i wanted so badly to say you 're doing the right thing '' 
 but of course i could n't 
 after the return mom picks up her coat picks up her boots grabs her by the arm and marches her out of the store 
 my coworkers and i stood in awe of an actual showing of awesome parenting that so rarely comes our way 
 **background : ** when i was a teenager i used to work for a big chain grocery store as a bagger in the great state of texas 
 i was 15 at the time 
 my managers name ... let 's call him jim 
 jim was a <unk> 
 he treated us poorly like we were <unk> him we never bagged quickly enough or returned from customers cars fast enough he claimed 
 he was the type of manager you hate to have 
 **the story : ** on this particular day we had a <unk> <unk> as we call them here in texas 
 basically a <unk> <unk> with loads of lightning <unk> and amazingly loud thunderclaps 
 it was raining so hard my jacket was even soaked through even though i was wearing a <unk> over it which i had to pay for 
 it was winter 
 it was quite cold out 
 i was <unk> teeth <unk> 
 this big built guy dressed like your typical biker comes through the lane i 'm bagging for 
 he 's around <unk> probably over <unk> when i finish bagging his things i ask if he 'd like help out to his car : bikerdude : are you kidding me 
 look at you 
 you 're already soaked 
 you must be freezing 
 they 're gon na make you go back out in this crap 
 me : well yeah i guess so ... bikerdude : where 's your manager 
 is it that little nerd with the <unk> over there 
 the *dry* one in that stupid vest 
 me *through laughter* : yeah that 's jim 
 bikerdude : hey jim 
 <unk> then storms over to where jim is standing 
 * bikerdude : hey there jim 
 look at this kid 
 he 's soaked to the <unk> and cold 
 why are you making these kids go out in this mess 
 jim : ... hello ... um ... sir 
 well to help our customers ... bikerdude : well how 'bout you think of your employees for a quick second 
 let them stay inside and warm up dry off 
 c'mon man be reasonable 
 jim : well sir our customers need help out to their cars and ... bikerdude : you know what you 're right 
 they do 
 i need help to my car 
 and i want *you* to help me out there jim 
 jim : uhhhhh ... i have to uhhhhh stay and watch over the ... bikerdude : what 's that saying 
 <unk> customer is always right 
 you 're helping me out to my car jim 
 by this time everyone was watching as jim and bikerdude strolled out with his basket 
 i went outside and stood under the covered entrance area to watch jim get his bikerdude was in a truck which was parked in the <unk> back of the parking lot 
 by the time jim got back he was just as soaked as i was 
 i acted like i was collecting carts and took jim 's from him he had a horribly sour look on his face which i of course enjoyed thoroughly 
 bikerdude pulled by in his truck and waved me over and handed me a $ 20 
 he told me to go take a break and dry off with a hot meal i said thanks and went back inside and asked jim for a break 
 he begrudgingly told me to take as long of a break as i needed to dry off 
 to this day i wonder what bikerdude said to him to get that reaction of of him 
 <unk> customers are actually <unk> work at a large well-known department store 
 right now i do n't have a set department each week and am moved around in toys sports hardware etc 
 today i was in hardware 
 an older man came into the store wanting to buy some <unk> paint 
 he chose his colour a minty green and wanted me to shake it for him 
 while waiting for his paint to be ready he suddenly asked have you heard of online <unk> '' 
 at first i was <unk> wondering where he might be going with this but i answered that i had 
 he smiled and said when i was a kid a cute freckled red-headed girl lived across the road from me 
 it 's been fifty years since i saw her but we 've been talking online and we 're going to be meeting again in a few days 
 can you imagine it ... it 's been <unk> <unk> '' 
 he went on to say i built my house but i 'm not very much into <unk> decorating so i have n't really <unk> 
 i decided since she 's coming over that i 'm going to have to 
 i 've already done the kitchen the bedroom the living room and now i 'm doing the bathroom '' 
 he glanced at the paint he was getting and laughed i do n't know why i went with green tile for the bathroom 
 i do n't even like green '' 
 once i showed him the mixed paint and he said it looked exactly the way he wanted he thanked me and went on his way 
 i hope everything goes well for him and the freckled red-headed woman really ... i had no idea 
 i was checking out of the local home supply warehouse and used my store credit card for my purchase - which consisted of a couple of pallets of fencing materials 
 the cashier did n't look like she was new 
 this particular store has everyone wearing orange <unk> and they are encouraged to decorate them 
 hers was starting to look a little <unk> but had lots of colored <unk> of flowers all over it 
 she 'd been here for a while 
 and she was wooden 
 she was doing her job quickly and efficiently but i might as well had been invisible 
 no eye contact no talk no life 
 taking my cue from her after my initial hello '' i stayed quiet 
 when i pulled out my store credit card she asked me if she could see my id too 
 i 've been the victim of identity theft before 
 my credit cards have my signature and a see id '' on the back 
 even now i have a fraud alert on my credit 
 so i 'm very happy when cashiers ask to see my id and i always tell them thank you '' in a cheerful manner 
 thank you so much for asking '' 
 i said as i pulled out my id i 'm always so glad when a cashier asks 
 i know people give you crap for it but it really does mean a lot to me 
 so thank you '' 
 and she started crying 
 it was n't like she was bawling but her eyes teared up and her voice got that <unk> tone we have all experienced at some point in our lives 
 there were n't any other customers so we talked for a few minutes about how terrible customers can be and she regained her composure again 
 apparently another customer had read her the riot act for something or another i 'm not sure what and it had really hurt her 
 i 've told her about <unk> - maybe we will see her here 
 this one happened about a year ago when i worked the customer service desk at one of those warehouse stores 
 now given that customers tended to purchase either large items or large amounts of items we provided <unk> as well as oversized shopping carts 
 one morning a perfectly <unk> <unk> gentleman comes up to me wheeling in a flatbed with a bunch of wine and asks to get a refund on it 
 okay so i grab a scan gun run around to his side of the counter thinking a wedding or something got cancelled 
 while i 'm scanning the bottles through he starts telling me why he 's returning them all 
 & gt it 's my wife 
 she drinks a lot 
 i know she does it even though she tries to keep it secret 
 i come home from work and she <unk> of perfume and breath <unk> but i can still smell it on her 
 i was checking our account statement last night and saw she spent a couple hundred dollars here and then i found the wine hidden in our basement 
 she 's killing herself 
 she 's killing herself and i ca n't stop her 
 i finished scanning the bottles 
 <unk> i remember it was 42 because i thought to myself wow i guess booze really is the meaning of life '' 
 i looked up and he was angry and on the verge of tears 
 i did n't know what to say so i processed his refund and kind of awkwardly told him to have a good day which i realized afterward i should 've left out 
 it was <unk> store has the same sort of rewards system most other stores do 
 free to sign up you get the sales prices and have coupons sent to you if you choose to provide that information 
 you can provide as little as your phone number or more if you want the coupons 
 if you do n't want to give me your number that 's fine you just do n't get the sales prices which i explain 
 enter mr. grumps 
 me : hello did you have a rewards number with us 
 grumps : no 
 me : would you like to get one so you can get our sale prices today 
 grumps : **no 
 ** i do **not** give out my information 
 me : okay no problem 
 just to let you know it wo n't ring up the sale prices 
 grumps : i do n't give out my information 
 i start ringing things up 
 i see some of his stuff would be on sale it puts an <unk> next to each item on sale 
 he sees it too because he stops me and <unk> his finger at the screen 
 grumps : hang on 
 that was cheaper on the shelf 
 me : yes ... as i said that 's on sale *with* our rewards program 
 are you sure you would n't like to sign up 
 you can just do a phone number if you 'd like you do n't have to give us anything else 
 grumps thinks about it for a moment 
 evidently these savings are worth it because he decides to sign up 
 i put in his phone number and *surprise* he 's already got an account with us 
 not only that but he has provided us with all of his information in the past 
 i spin the screen around 
 me : oh is this you 
 grumps : oh ... huh ... i guess it is ... me : and is all this information still correct 
 grumps : yeah 
 so much for not giving out your <unk> back when i worked for a popular coffee shop one of my supervisors told me a great story about a lady who clearly was n't grounded very well in our modern reality 
 so this lady comes in with her child orders a drink for herself and a hot chocolate for her child 
 the hot chocolate gets finished and put on the bar for the child who comes up and accepts it and being a little cutie <unk> thanks mister '' 
 lady standing behind her child clucks her tongue and says to her child now now we do n't thank the help '' 
 my co-worker looks at the kid says you have a wonderful day sweety '' 
 then looks at her mother and says i 'm sorry maam i 'm going to have to ask you to leave the store now 
 another story from the used media store i work for 
 the other day a man and his two sons came in with some games to trade 
 now we 're required by law to take a valid id with any trade 
 it creates a paper trail should anything come up as stolen later on 
 the kids brought their games to the counter and i cheerfully asked for an id 
 the older son called his dad over who we 'll call history <unk> or hb for short 
 me : hi i just need a valid license or state i.d 
 to get started 
 hb : my license 
 me : yes sir or a state id if you do n't have one 
 hb : you know it 's illegal for you to ask me that 
 me : actually sir we 're <unk> with state law 
 hb : i 'm talking federal law 
 it 's illegal under the <unk> 
 me : unfortunately sir i 'm still required to have it before i can do any sort of trade for you today 
 hb : yeah i 'll give it to you i 'm just trying to <unk> you 
 people your age never know anything about history or laws 
 this is the point where i really needed to bite my tongue and force that cheerful retail smile as he pulled a driver 's license and a concealed carry license from his wallet 
 he handed me the latter 
 being a state issued id it was acceptable and i made no further comment on it 
 i did his trade his sons chose a game and in an effort to kill them with kindness i cheerfully wished him a nice day to which he rudely replied yeah just study your history '' 
 what a <unk> work at a a toy store 
 i was working at the cash register 
 a customer brings up a monster high doll to buy 
 for those unfamiliar with monster high it 's pretty much <unk> 's creepy monster <unk> 
 this particular doll was from a new line of oversized dolls about double the size of the regular ones that cost a bit more 
 after ringing her up i tell her the total which comes to $ 40 plus tax 
 & gt lady : your wrong 
 that 's too much 
 & gt me : it 's ringing up for $ 39.99 was there a different price on the shelf 
 & gt lady : the sign over there says they are 17. she points towards the entrance area in the completely opposite side of the store of the doll department 
 while i do n't work in dolls i see enough of these dolls to know that is far too low the regular sized ones rarely are that cheap unless on sale or clearance 
 so i let her lead me to in the direction she was pointed to a sign by the entrance 
 & gt lady : see this sign says $ 17 
 the sign in question was indeed about the doll she was buying an advertisement about the bigger line of dolls but no where did it say a price 
 however the sign did say <unk> tall <unk> 17 '' tall* & gt me : i 'm sorry but this sign does n't say a price just that these dolls are 17 inch tall 
 & gt lady : it says 17. you need to sell it to me for that much 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but that is n't a price but a height 
 i ca n't sell you it for that much & gt lady : that 's misleading you should sell me it for 17 like the sign says 
 & gt me : it says that it is 17 inch tall that pointing to the sign is a <unk> for inches not dollars 
 & gt lady : how do you know that is n't dollars 
 i want it for that price you ca n't have numbers that are n't a price 
 at this point i was frustrated this was an adult and somehow was unfamiliar with units of measurement or basic reading <unk> 
 & gt me : the sign does n't say that it is 17 dollars 
 it says that it is 17 inches 
 double <unk> means inches not dollars 
 those are two different types of units 
 i ca n't lower a price because you misread a sign 
 & gt lady : this is ridiculous 
 if you do n't give me that price i am going to get you fined for false advertising 
 & gt me : sorry 
 i ca n't 
 that is clearly not the price 
 she glares at me and storms off in a huff 
 kicking the sign as she goes 
 i 'm a manager at a well-known <unk> store 
 we get a lot of interesting customers 
 a customer and her kids were at the register with one of our strongest cashiers a <unk> older woman with quite a few years of experience under her belt 
 i was working on something at a nearby counter throughout the exchange 
 the customer had around $ 400 worth of merchandise to purchase and my cashier was going above and beyond in order to use every coupon the customer had across multiple transactions 
 final total came to around $ 260 so she had saved quite a lot of money already 
 **customer** : i thought these tops were $ 4 
 **cashier** : oh no they 're $ 4 if you buy three 
 you only bought two 
 **customer** : that 's not what the sign says 
 it just says $ 4 
 **cashier** : well let 's go see 
 the cashier takes the customer to the sign which was right near the cash wrap 
 the sign sitting right in the middle of the tank tops in question states ribbed tanks 3 for $ 4 each '' in large text and 2 for $ 5 each '' in smaller text and they are the only tanks on the table 
 **customer** : so this says that the shirts on this table are $ 4 if you buy three 
 well i also got this shirt she pointed to a <unk> shirt that was on the back side of the table on lower shelves so they are all $ 4 
 **cashier** : no it 's just the tanks 
 you only have two tanks so they are $ 5 and that shirt is not on sale 
 **customer** : no 
 she gestures <unk> across the store to the sign as they 've made their way back to the cash register at this point 
 that 's not what it says 
 ca n't you read 
 **cashier** : yes ma'am it is 
 i 'm watching carefully at this point as the customer begins to get upset 
 the cashier handles the situation very cooly but i 'm starting to think i might need to intervene 
 **customer** : your signs are so misleading 
 i ca n't believe you 're not going to honor your prices 
 **cashier** : the sign says $ 4 when you buy 3 
 **customer** : they are $ 4 
 she 's gesturing this entire time 
 it 's really irritating to me 
 **cashier** : yes when you buy three of the same shirt 
 **customer** : i do n't know why i shop here 
 this store is horrible 
 **cashier** : i 'm sorry you 're disappointed 
 did you want me to take off those tanks 
 **customer** : no i want them for $ 4 
 **cashier** : unfortunately they 're not $ 4 unless you buy three 
 unless you want to get a third i can either take them off or give them to you for $ 5 each 
 it 's up to you 
 such an awesome cashier 
 i love employees like this 
 the customer continues to <unk> throughout the rest of the transaction after having the cashier remove the shirts from the bill 
 she pays and goes to leave when the <unk> at the door begin to activate as her sons pass through 
 i check her merchandise and find no electronic tags left on her clothing 
 complaining she walks through the door herself and with her bags and does not set off the alarm 
 when her child follows suit however the system lights up 
 she pulls a shirt out from his pants throws it at me and leaves in a huff 
 um bye then 
 **tl dr** : customer complains about $ 2 on a $ 260 purchase 
 meanwhile her son tries to <unk> stories in less than a week 
 which retail deity did i scorn 
 which cardinal direction do i have to bow and <unk> to 
 -- - so i have a <unk> today 4 hours covers the lunch rush and i 'm working on the sandwich line 
 we make all manner of sandwiches but one in particular is <unk> more popular than all the others 
 so much so that we tend to run out of the materials to make them within only a few hours 
 some people apparently have taken to using ... <unk> methods to try and get one 
 note : stating exactly what the sandwich is will probably give away my place of business 
 it 's not even that good <unk> anyway the person in question was a young <unk> who i swear to god walks straight up to my sandwich counter and pulls out a list of all things 
 & gt sbm <unk> business man : i need 8 sandwiches 5 of popular sandwich 2 roast beef 1 <unk> & gt me : sir i will be more than happy to serve you once i 've helped the customers ahead of you 
 points at the <unk> of <unk> other people he 's just tried to cut in front of & gt sbm : _excuse me & gt me : i <unk> & gt sbm : i heard you smart-*** 
 i do n't have time for this 
 do you even know who i am 
 oh boy 
 here we go 
 & gt me : no sir i 'm afraid i <unk> & gt sbh : i 'm the franchise owner from next town over you little <unk> oh good 
 one of _these_ guys i 've heard tell of them 
 heck i 've seen stories about them here on tfr but to be honest i thought they were like leprechauns : everyone 's heard of one but never seen one for themselves 
 to clarify we are a small _independently-owned_ bakery 
 there are no franchises 
 in the space of about five seconds i 'm trying to decide what the best course of action would be to deal with this guy would be and it ended up being the worst possible thing i could do to the poor idiot 
 i played along 
 & gt me : oh dear i 'm so sorry sir i was n't told you ordered here 
 wait here i 'll get the business owner he 'll want to apologize personally 
 hey business owner the franchise owner from next town over wants to see you 
 i 've never seen a man <unk> so hard in all my life 
 if he 'd backed off any faster he would 've <unk> out the storefront window 
 this happened in the early <unk> and is my first post to /r/tfr so i thought i 'd give it a shot 
 i worked at a chain <unk> grocery store 
 i had been working through the <unk> and was head cashier at the time which basically meant i figured out breaks and handled customers when the cashiers could n't 
 this fine summer afternoon i spot <unk> this creepy guy 
 anyway he was in line to one of our cuter cashiers who as soon as she saw him flashed her checkout light signaling for help 
 backstory : this is the disgusting part and i can not deny or prove this however i had heard from several <unk> that this guy liked to go into the checkouts of cute girls stare at them for a bit then go home and while staring at their name on the receipt jerk off to them 
 anyway back to the story 
 as i saw the cute girls light flash i knew immediately what to do 
 i waited a few moments until the man was committed to the line then <unk> it straight to her register told her to sign out and go on break was n't really her time to go it was more of an excuse to not <unk> suspicion 
 got him - i knew the man had already placed his half gallon of milk and other sad groceries on the belt and could n't escape 
 his smirk <unk> in front of my eyes like a child opening a box for christmas and it revealing a subscription to field & amp stream magazine 
 i gave him the <unk> hello 
 how are you today '' 
 smiling and making eye contact 
 <unk> where i decided to push the awkward meter further 
 i decided to maintain eye contact the *entire <unk> i rang him out 
 he mumbled something incoherent but i did n't care 
 i was beaming on the inside 
 however my job was half done 
 i still had to ring him out 
 i must 've fumbled with that box of cereal for a few more seconds than i should have but i was not going to break that eye contact 
 i literally felt around like a blind man while i maintained my <unk> onto him 
 oh he started grunting and looked away multiple times but i felt like it was my civil duty to make him as uncomfortable as he made those girls 
 thank god i had a bagger to help otherwise i would 've had to bagged his items and break that eye contact 
 after ringing him out for what felt like forever was really only 5-10 items i handed him his receipt and when he went to grab it from me i maintained a firm grip on it looked him dead in the eyes pointed to my name on the receipt and said : & gt in case you did n't know my name is <unk> i hope i provided you with excellent customer service '' 
 i let go of the receipt and watched him twitch off 
 i think i saw a <unk> on his forehead explode 
 the cashier came back and thanked me for helping her with him 
 aftermath : other cashiers and baggers apparently saw this whole ordeal and watched the entire thing transpire 
 one of the other baggers came up to me later on saying he saw the man throw the receipt out when he got outside 
 after aftermath : a few weeks later i saw the man in queue for another female 's line 
 immediately i went up to the cashier and told her to go on break flashing him a wink and a smile 
 the man *i kid you not* placed his items on the floor turned and walked out 
 edit : holy balls 
 gold 
 many thanks 
 edit2 : just to clarify i have been out of retail for about 7 years and have joined the lovely world of <unk> farms '' 
 i will post as many stories as i remember from my retail past 
 edit3 : a word 
 wow i did not expect for this post to blow up like this 
 thank you all for your comments i 'll post more soon i work in customer service at a store that has a credit card program 
 naturally when the credit bills are n't paid corporate will decline the card when a customer tries to use it 
 this leads me to my story my front end manager sends me a call on the phone back at the service desk telling me that i am about to have a woman come back to yell at me because her card is declined 
 my manager also told me that they called corporate 's financial department twice and they told the lady the same thing each time : her bill had n't been paid 
 so the lady shows up at my counter and demands to use the courtesy corporate phone for customers 
 i nicely hand her the phone and tell her that it has an automated main menu to guide her to what corporate department representative she 'd like to speak with 
 she ignored me and started yelling into the phone for 15 minutes about how angry she is 
 eventually she goes you 
 talk '' 
 and hands me the phone 
 i put the receiver to my ear to talk and i am cut off with press 1 for english 2 for spanish 3 for more options '' 
 she ranted to the main menu for 15 minutes 
 i page my manager because i had no idea how to handle the lady after i broke the news that she had just talked to a main menu for that whole time 
 she left angrily and i know have a great story to <unk> is my first time posting in this sub so i hope i do it correctly 
 i work at a hardware store in the paint department and one day a couple of years ago i got an extremely ... confusing phone call 
 customer : hello there i was wondering if you carry dick stein '' 
 me : ... i 'm sorry a which stein '' 
 customer : dick stein you know to paint your dick '' 
 me : oh sweet jesus he is aussie '' yes ... we do carry deck stain '' 
 needless to say i 'm still laughing about it 
 good <unk> accents 
 he was charming but i was thoroughly confused and disturbed at first 
 edit : thanks for everyone letting me know it 's actually a new <unk> accent 
 cross posted with <unk> - delete if it should n't be here too ... on friday night i was out shopping with my <unk> daughter and we stopped by a well-known fast food restaurant around 7:00 pm 
 it was obvious they were training a few counter help because the employees were paired up and walking around with each other 
 i work retail so i recognized that deer in the headlights '' look a few of them had on their faces because we 've got a few new employees at our store too 
 there were quite a few people in line but we were in no rush so we just stood in line without complaint 
 but - there was this grumpy elderly man directly in front of us that kept complaining and trying to get us in on his little <unk> 
 finally came old man 's time to order 
 i heard his entire transaction he was rude cashiers were extremely polite to him 
 when it was done he turned around and looked at my daughter and said you better stay in school so that you do n't end up like these people with a job like this '' 
 i was a tad pissed off - first do n't drag my kid into your rude-fest and second - just well do n't 
 i looked at him and said it 's obvious they are in training and they were not rude to you at all 
 these kids are most likely all still in school and trying to make a little money while dealing with really rude customers 
 it would n't bother me at all if my daughter worked here one day - at least she 'd be working hard for honest money '' 
 **i really wish i were kidding - i had never had the opportunity to speak to a customer like this and it felt good 
 my daughter was horrified and said i embarrassed her by talking to the grumpy man 
 i did n't care 
 ignorant old man.years ago i worked as a <unk> for an electronics retailer 
 i had worked there a while so i knew the products and policies pretty well 
 i prided myself in genuinely helping customers as best as i could 
 i was very fortunate to have an awesome store manager : he treated both customers and employees fairly 
 if someone treated him with respect he would go out of his way to help them out 
 however he was no pushover : he had no tolerance for bs 
 overall he was a great boss who always trusted our judgment and would help us out whenever needed 
 one day a gentleman came in and asked to return a rather expensive cassette recorder 
 i did say that this was years ago 
 he handed me the box which was old worn and faded 
 i opened it and found that the recorder was in equally poor shape -- scratched and dented through years of use 
 i politely asked when he bought it 
 **customer : ** i just bought it last week 
 from the wear and tear i can see clearly that this recorder is <unk> a year old likely more 
 at this point i know for sure that he 's trying to scam me 
 regardless i stay completely polite and professional 
 **me : ** okay 
 could i please see your receipt 
 **customer : ** i lost the receipt 
 but i just bought it last week 
 now we do have some discretion on what returns we could accept 
 however this was way past the line : it was too badly damaged to ever <unk> was quite expensive and was well past the 30 day return policy 
 without a receipt there was no way anyone in the store was accepting that return 
 **me : ** i 'm sorry sir 
 this item appears to be very old and damaged 
 i can not accept this return without a receipt 
 he responded as you might expect : **customer : ** i want to see your manager 
 at this point i should point out that my manager was built like a tank : around 6 foot 6 inches tall around <unk> pounds quite muscular 
 while he was very nice he could also be <unk> intimidating if he wanted to be 
 there was no way that my manager would put up with any bs from this customer 
 as such even though the customer asked to speak to the manager i was pretty sure it was n't a good plan 
 as such i politely responded as genuinely helpful as i could : **me : ** i do n't think you do 
 **customer : ** what 
 i said i want to see your manager 
 **me : ** yes sir 
 i heard you 
 i just do n't think it 's a good idea 
 **customer : ** get me your manager 
 **me : ** i recommend against it 
 **customer : ** now 
 okay i tried my best 
 i called out to my manager who had been listening to the whole conversation from the back room 
 **me : ** manager could you come out here 
 my boss stomped from the back room towards the register 
 slowly and <unk> the <unk> echoed through the store 
 stomp ... stomp ... stomp ... the customer 's eyes widened as he saw a large angry man <unk> from the back room 
 stomp ... stomp ... stomp ... he walked up to the customer looked him right in the face and loudly asked **manager : ** what 
 **customer : ** err ... uh ... i uh ... wanted to return this 
 **manager : ** pointing at me well what did he tell you 
 **customer : ** uh well he said no ... **manager : ** then what are you asking me for 
 without another word he walked quietly back to his office in the back room 
 i politely asked the customer if there was anything else i could help him with 
 the customer said no and quickly left 
 have been lurking for a while now but finally decided to share some of my stories from <unk> years of retail 
 this happened a few years ago so i 'll try my best to recall it as it happened 
 a bit of background info for context 
 this was in a very bilingual city english & amp french with the rural areas around the city being either very english read redneck or very french their own kind of special 
 without getting into the <unk> this can sometimes cause some tension 
 my first language is english but i am bilingual 
 i was working at a large canadian outdoor equipment retailer in the cycling section this day 
 two middle age guys walk in and right from the outset i could tell this was going to be interesting 
 they were dressed in the equivalent of john deer t-shirts with camo hats on one does pretty much all the talking so i 'll refer to him as ch 
 now if we sold hunting or fishing gear that would be one thing but we 're more of the <unk> around <unk> store so they were a little out of place 
 they stroll into the bike section and i m greet them just as i would any customer ... m : hi can i give you a hand with anything today 
 ch : we need some tube patches and tubes for our bikes m : okay our patches are just over here 
 we walk over to the patches and i start into my spiel m : so we 've got two types of patches our in-house brand at x $ and other brand at y $ i hand ch a box of each so he can check them out 
 all seems to be quite normal so far 
 ch : what is this 
 m : what seems to be the issue 
 ch pointing to the back of the box : the instructions are in french they 're supposed to be in english 
 m a little taken a back : well as you can see the instruction are just on a piece of paper sitting inside the clear box i 'm sure the other side of paper has the english instructions 
 ch : what are you guys trying to pull here the english is always supposed to be first 
 m seeing where this is going but trying to play it off : well these are all made in china so i 'm sure some factory worker has just placed them in with no regard for what side faces out 
 ch : this is unacceptable french is a second class language and should always come second to english 
 the government even says so 
 i 'm quite taken aback at this and get a little bit defensive because i 'm not really in the mood to tolerate discrimination 
 m : i have to disagree with you sir french is not a second class language it is protected as equal to english 
 ch : no english always has to come first ... at this point one of my managers who is super nice we 'll call him sn has been lurking and overheard that the interaction has gotten a little heated and decides to step in 
 i take a step back and observe 
 sn in french : good afternoon gentlemen what seems to be the problem here 
 ch : excuse me 
 at this point i ca n't tell if he 's come over to make a point by speaking french or what is going through his head but it 's getting good 
 sn in french again : is everything alright over here i just thought i would see if i can assist in any way 
 ch : do you see a <unk> on my face 
 shit has hit the fan 
 sn realizes he has made a mistake but its too late 
 ch storms out of the store in a huff leaves the patches 
 i 'm standing a ways back so sn comes over to me to <unk> 
 sn : what just happened there 
 m : well they were just saying how french is a second class language and i disagreed with them 
 sn : oh i though they were saying that as french people they felt like second class <unk> 
 m : nope not at all 
 sn : so i pretty much did the worst thing possible there did n't i 
 m : yep hope you enjoyed my first story 
 i 'll share more if it does well 
 edit 2 : ok this did much better than expected thanks everyone 
 will be sure to post another one next time i get the chance 
 edit : formatting i am a phone solicitor 
 we get hired by various insurance companies to call their customers and let them know all the additional policies they are <unk> for 
 we like to pretend that we 're calling as a <unk> * but yeah we really want you to buy something 
 one of the <unk> <unk> of my company is that we follow all telemarketing laws to the letter 
 this includes not arguing with people in no <unk> states not calling cell phones after eight <unk> clock all that good stuff 
 for this reason we 're required to open the phone call with our full name and the name of the company we 're <unk> along with a warning that the call is being recorded and close the phone call with that company 's customer service number 
 even if the customer hangs up you 'll still find us repeating that phone number into dead air because it 's a major <unk> if we do n't 
 now my job does involve annoying a lot of people and i know that you probably just want to get off the phone with me but i really do need to say that number 
 i will end the call as soon as it 's out or you can hang up on me in the middle of it but that number is happening 
 i called a woman a few nights ago who <unk> turned me down on my generous offer of supplemental health insurance 
 we 'll call her c. since c was pretty adamant about not buying the product i went into my courtesy close and <unk> had her off the phone in about fifteen seconds 
 me : thank you for your time and if you have any questions you can reach us at 1-800- '' c : i *do n't 
 * '' me : that 's good to hear and our toll free number is- '' c : we are <unk> here '' 
 me : yes ma'am and if you ever need to contact us- '' c : we are done 
 hang up '' 
 me : of course ma'am our toll free number is- '' c : hang up right now '' 
 me : ma'am i- i ca n't end this call without providing you with this number 
 it 's 1-800- '' c : no you will end this call now '' 
 me : of course ma'am 
 really quickly now that 's 1-800-5- '' c : i do n't want your fucking number i want you do fucking do what i say '' 
 me : ma'am i would actually be breaking laws if i did n't give you this <unk> '' c : i do n't want your fucking insurance get the hell off my phone '' 
 me : oh ... okay ma'am you are free to end this call at any time so i 'm going to wait a moment so you can hang up okay '' 
 c : ... '' me : ... '' c : ... '' me : we can be reached at 1-8- '' c : i told you to fucking hang up '' 
 me : ma'am i *really* want to but as i 've told you this call is being recorded for quality purposes and i need to say it for the record 
 you 're free to end the call whenever you like and i 'll gladly get out of your hair i just need to say that our number is 1- '' c : no 
 you 're not going to say it 
 i told you not to say it '' 
 me : i 'm very sorry ma'am you 're under no obligation to listen to it- '' c : i told you to hang up 
 you **have** to hang up 
 me : i will ma'am i <unk> just let me say very quickly that you can reach us <unk> '' c : hang 
 the 
 fuck 
 up '' 
 me : <unk> '' c : get me your manager '' 
 my manager when given the headset only spent a few seconds trying to reason with her before shouting the number over her protestations and hanging up on <unk> just closed at 6 pm sunday and we 're trying to get the last of the customers out 
 there is an old man still shopping 
 we turn off some lights hoping he will finish up but even with my supervisor telling him we 're closed he continues to look around the aisles 
 it 's almost 6:15 pm and he makes his way to my cash 
 & gt me : hello how are you find everything you were looking for 
 & gt old man : well i would have kept shopping if you were n't closing 
 & gt me : yeah sorry about that 
 & gt om : i thought you guys like getting paid overtime 
 & gt me : yes but unfortunately we have to close 
 & gt om : when i was back in the business if a customer comes in before the store is closed and is still there we let them shop 
 & gt me : it 's more so a liability issue since we are moving pallets and stock around and we do n't want you to get hurt 
 & gt om : well i just think you guys do n't want to work 
 oh that 's right i do n't want to go home because i do n't have a life 
 unlike most of my memorable transactions that leave me <unk> <unk> to walking out this lady made my day 
 i was charging in a rather blah mood today when i notice that the customer headed for my register had thee coolest workout leggings ever 
 they were superhero leggings in case y'all are curious 
 so i charge her rather small transaction while i start the small talk every customer gets 
 instead it takes off into one of those did we just become best friends '' 
 conversations where you get along extra well 
 at one point i mention her apple watch something i 've been wanting for a while now 
 she had it in the exact color combo that i 've been after 
 she tells me she got it back when it was on sale 
 i tell her i remembered that sale and that i 'd tried going after work but that they were already sold out and they would n't give me a raincheck 
 she says really 
 hmm ... they gave me one 
 i ended up having to drive a few <unk> over to pick it up but i got it '' 
 the conversation shifts and eventually she leaves the store 
 i continue charging for about half an hour when she comes back in holding up a receipt saying i found it i found it '' 
 she 's saying this as she heads to my register 
 i 'm really confused because she was n't returning anything or had any other reason to need a receipt when she was here 
 & gt me : huh 
 & gt superhero lady : i found my raincheck 
 here you can have it 
 i got two of them because i was going to buy two 
 it 's good until the end of next month 
 now you can get the watch too 
 in retrospect our conversation was a bit long considering the amount of things she was purchasing and i do remember her digging through her purse for a while even though she paid pretty quickly with a debit card 
 i 'm guessing she was trying to find it while she was at my register 
 it just really blows my mind that people can be this <unk> 
 she came back in after about half an hour maybe more just to give me that receipt 
 she could 've been home or having lunch or anywhere else 
 i 'm sure i do n't have to tell you guys how horrible people can be especially in retail but today i saw the other end of that spectrum 
 it was christmas eve and lucky me i was organizing the dog shoes people will steal one and only one shoe 
 customer : excuse me what time do you open tomorrow 
 me : we 're closed tomorrow in fact we 're closing in half an hour 
 customer : that is unacceptable 
 i need a manager 
 me : sure just a second *i flag her down from the next aisle* manager : what 's the problem 
 customer : i want to shop tomorrow 
 manager : we 're closed tomorrow but you can always use our website 
 customer : i 'll be here no matter what 
 the next day one associate and a manager come in for an hour to feed the animals 
 they hear someone banging on the door 
 it 's the customer from yesterday 
 manager # 2 tells her they 're just feeding the animals and that the store is closed 
 he locks the door and gets back to work 
 the customer '' starts ripping at the <unk> around the door and kicking the glass 
 the police were called and they took her away in handcuffs 
 i 'm sure she had a lovely christmas 
 we had holiday hours posted since <unk> happened about a year and a half ago 
 i used to be a studio photographer 
 one day a mother and her two teenagers came into the studio for basic school pictures 
 no problem 
 school pictures and business pictures are some of the easiest 
 we pick <unk> and i start with her younger daughter about 14 years old i usually take 3 different pictures to start all at different angles 
 i then ask which angle they like best and they would like me to <unk> it 
 & gt mom : no i do n't like any of those 
 i take several more 
 again none of them are 'good 
 i spend <unk> minutes with this mom and daughter trying to get a good one for them 
 the mom even got some old school pictures out and showed me what she liked 
 <unk> pictures later mom still hates every picture 
 the mom tells me & gt you 're not really <unk> photographer can we have her take them 
 pointing to my manager i go get my manager and explain the situation 
 she was very busy and could n't really take the session but the mom insisted my manager goes into the session to take over 
 she takes another <unk> minutes taking pictures of the daughter and another 15 to take pictures of the older son mom takes an additional 20 minutes to order not abnormal and they leave 
 after they leave my manager tells me about the conversation they had after not getting a good picture of the daughter 
 & gt manager : i 'm not completely sure what you are wanting done differently 
 & gt mom : it 's nothing you 're doing 
 she 's just at this really awkward stage right now and i really do n't like her <unk> story takes place ~3 years ago 
 it happened 3 months after i was hired at the gym 
 now i had always known that something was off with my boss 
 she was truly a psycho 
 she constantly screamed at her employees and did some things against company policy stealing etc 
 all the employees there were about 12 of us had enough and reported her 
 she ended up receiving a call from her boss one day letting her know that he was going to come in and talk to her 
 cue the story ... *i was working with my co-worker that day 
 my boss came in very late with her children 3 and 5 
 she immediately started yelling at me that i needed to <unk> and feed her children while i was overseeing the desk 
 i was bewildered by her request but too afraid to say anything about it 
 * & gt boss : nepotismx my boss is coming down to the office today 
 do you have any idea why he might be coming 
 i think you and everyone else have been <unk> behind my back 
 & gt me : uhm i know nothing about that 
 & gt boss : we will see 
 i know you must have told him i stole the money from the fundraiser 
 how could you be such a backstabbing bitch to me 
 you are out to get me fired 
 & gt me : uh ... & gt co-worker : uh we really have no clue about any of that 
 & gt boss : well you just watch 
 i will not be fired 
 *she walked to her office and slammed her door shut 
 meanwhile her kids were fussing and my co-worker and i are trying to help customers as well 
 suddenly the front desk phone rings and i answer it 
 * & gt me : hello nepotismx speaking 
 how may i <unk> & gt boss : nepotismx i did it 
 i am going to commit suicide 
 i just took all of my prescription drugs 
 the entire bottle 
 i hope you feel guilty because this is all your fault 
 you and the other workers 
 & gt me : are you joking 
 co-worker the boss is attempting to commit suicide 
 & gt co-worker : what 
 omg let me call 911 
 *my co-worker and i rushed into the boss office we left her kids at the desk with a customer 
 * & gt me : what did you take 
 the paramedics are on their way 
 & gt boss : i took the entire bottle 
 i bet you feel sorry now 
 *she gets out of her office and onto the gym floor and starts announcing to all the customers that the paramedics are coming for her because she is about to die 
 chaos breaks loose people are bewildered confused and ambushing my co-worker and i about wtf is happening 
 * & gt co-worker : boss get back in your office 
 your kids are going to see all of this 
 & gt boss : i do not care 
 i hate all of you 
 everyone here 
 you are all backstabbing bitches 
 *the paramedics arrived and took her out on a stretcher 
 she ended up making it through however she lost her job and caused everyone to feel disturbed for quite a while 
 to this day i have never had a boss quite like her 
 * this is n't my story this one is from my customer service manager in a store i where i used to work 
 many years ago she worked in a store in a big regional town in the north west of australia and witnessed this little spectacle 
 also some coarse language 
 so this is a big supermarket and very busy 
 the express checkout was set out in such a way that everybody lines up in one long queue and gets called to the next available register 
 it 's the middle of summer so it 's hot like <unk> 
 there 's one poor mum with a toddler who has been a little jerk all through the store tantrums screaming the whole bit 
 terrible twos or some such 
 mum and kiddo line up in the express queue kid still shrieking and mum has enough 
 it 's hot she 's tired she 's over it 
 she gives the kid a swift smack on the bottom 
 the screaming stops and mum gets a few moments of piece 
 the woman behind her <unk> and says very <unk> : in <unk> we do n't smack our children '' 
 mum turns around and yells at her : yeah well in australia we do n't gas our fucking <unk> '' 
 you could have heard a pin drop 
 the store goes dead silent and neither the german woman nor angry aussie mum say another word to each other 
 our store closed at 8pm christmas eve and at <unk> pm this man comes up to me panicked asking me where we had a rc <unk> toy 
 as i was well aware we were sold out for over a week on the item i told him this 
 he asks me to check the back and i tell him it would be no use as we had not gotten any in all week and there was no freight coming in on christmas eve 
 the man looks at me dead in the eye and told me i was heartless and ruined his childs christmas 
 this of course is not the first time i had been told this and wo n't be the last time either 
 since i looked like i was not worried about this the man stormed off and demanded a manager fire me for ruining his kids christmas 
 which did not happen 
 my manager told me i should at least look sorry and i told him i would if i was but it is not my fault he waited until 15 minutes from our closing time to go christmas shopping for his kids presents 
 i am not responsible for his poor planning and said piss poor planning on his part does not constitute an emergency on mine 
 the manager <unk> back 
 damn i forgot you are a military brat 
 i laughed as he told me to just keep cleaning up 
 tl dr. man waited 15 minutes until store closed to shop for his kids christmas presents we were sold out of a toy he wanted 
 i got blamed for ruining christmas 
 because i did not look sorry he told a manager to fire me 
 did not work out the way he wanted 
 i work for a chain which has just a few stores open nationwide 
 this means that the corporate ladder is n't that high and that store managers have a lot of freedom to exercise their own judgement 
 this can be awesome or it can really suck it <unk> on whose side the manager is on 
 here is something that scared the crap out of me 
 this story takes place on a tuesday morning 
 our store opens at 9:00 am and at <unk> our first customer walks in from now on referred to as al for angry lady 
 i 'm just <unk> at the register since there 's not too much to do at the moment and she 's walking around the store looking at items 
 this is when another customer walks in and comes up to me 
 he 's a regular so we exchange pleasantries 
 he has some questions about a product so i talk to him about it and answer all his questions 
 he says thank you and leaves 
 this all takes about 10 minutes so the time is now <unk> after he leaves al comes up to the counter looking pissed off 
 & gt al : how come i had to wait so long 
 & gt <unk> 
 she was n't anywhere near the counter or even in my field of view 
 how the hell am i supposed to know that she wanted help 
 * & gt me : i 'm sorry i did n't know you were waiting to be helped 
 i can check out your items right now 
 & gt al : this is unacceptable i 'm a very busy woman and you people should n't waste my time like this 
 & gt me 
 i 'm very sorry i 'll try and get you checked out as soon as possible 
 & gt al : let me talk to your manager 
 you need to be more professional 
 & gt *what the hell lady 
 if you 're busy just let me check out your items and then leave 
 * & gt me : sure i can get my manager for you 
 but if you 're in a hurry i can get all your stuff checked out right away 
 & gt al : nope i want to speak to your manager 
 & gt *now just to set the scene my manager is 6'3 '' and built like an ox 
 if he 's mad you 'd better hope that it 's not at you 
 i page the manager and he comes over 
 * & gt mg : what can i help you with 
 & gt al : this is unacceptable 
 i 've been waiting here for 45 minutes and i 've received no help from your employee 
 you need to hire more professional people 
 & gt <unk> gets a really <unk> look 
 * & gt mg : i 'm so sorry ma'am that certainly is unacceptable 
 throw-three why has this lady been waiting for so long 
 & gt me : well i was just helping <unk> & gt mg : no that is just not acceptable 
 were you the one who locked up last night 
 & gt *all of my wat 
 and yes i lock up every night 
 * & gt me : well yes but what has this got to do <unk> & gt mg : well then we 're going to have to fire you 
 & gt *at this point i had no fucking idea what was going on 
 i really had no idea what to say so i just kind of stood there with my mouth open 
 mg then turned and started talking to al 
 * & gt mg : i 'm so sorry we open at 9:00 and it 's <unk> right now so if you 've been waiting for 45 minutes then clearly throw-three did not lock up correctly last night 
 this is a huge security risk for the company and he needs to be fired 
 can i have you sign documents confirming that you were able to walk into the store outside operating hours 
 & gt *ho 
 <unk> 
 shit 
 this was around the time that i closed my mouth 
 al looked <unk> 
 * & gt al : no i 'm late 
 i 'll just come back later 
 and with that she walked out of the door leaving her items on the counter 
 my manager just grinned at me and went back to his office 
 that was one of the wtf moments i 've had working there 
 i went from bored -- & gt annoyed -- & gt confused -- & gt scared -- & gt angry -- & gt happy in the <unk> of like 2 minutes 
 at least my manager has my <unk> for some background i have a skin condition which means that the top <unk> of my skin is often very <unk> and cracked in places 
 however this is totally <unk> and does n't pose a risk to anyone beyond looking bad 
 i was working the till today when a man in his 50s came up to the till 
 i 'm me customer is grumpy man or gm 
 & gt me : good afternoon 
 did you find everything you were looking for 
 & gt gm : <unk> <unk> & gt me : & lt puts everything through till gives total 
 puts hand out for money he was giving me & gt & gt gm : disgusting that is ... & gt me : sir 
 & gt gm : *points at hand* you your hand 
 you should n't be allowed anywhere near a till like that 
 why do n't you try washing them 
 he then proceeds to go off on a rant about it for a good minute making a number of very insensitive remarks about me before <unk> down the counter to pack his stuff 
 at this point i felt terrible and i was doing everything to not break down into tears in front of everyone 
 now behind him was a kid who ca n't have been more than 7 or 8. i could see him watching this man and then me 
 then he started rather loudly asking his mum : & gt kid : mummy why is the man being mean 
 he 's being mean to the lady 
 people should n't be mean 
 now at this the man turned back round to face the till and was giving this kid filthy looks 
 then the kid studies my hand and comes out with : & gt scales 
 cool you 've got snake power 
 i love kids 
 certainly cheered me up if anything else 
 i work as a cashier at a high end grocery store in a very affluent area 
 most of our customers are young professionals and wealthy older people most of whom are wonderful easy-going <unk> nice people 
 but as with any retail establishment we have several customers that would best be described as devil-spawn '' or <unk> <unk> '' earlier this week our store was experiencing its daily <unk> rush and i was on a register trying to funnel the hungry mobs and their bags full of kale out the door as quickly as possible 
 despite how busy we were i do my best to make friendly albeit brief conversation with everyone who comes through my line 
 smiling and being personable i 've found tends to make the whole checkout process much more pleasant for everyone involved 
 i was ringing up a young couple and their extremely polite 7 year old son 
 i jokingly told the boy that he should apply for a job his parents laughed saying that he could finally start paying them the rent he owed them 
 i laughed too saying something about children being terrible roommates and soon sent them on their way 
 after everything was finished the older blonde woman behind them in line began chatting with me as i scanned and bagged her groceries 
 besides me telling her that she looked nice today our conversation was pretty <unk> some <unk> discussion of the weather and other standard small-talk 
 i handed over her receipt and told her to enjoy the rest of her day 
 then she surprised me by asking if there was a manager available to speak to 
 c : customer m : me & gt m : *pointing to my manager behind the customer service desk* that 's manager 's name right over there she can take care of pretty much anything you need 
 have a good one 
 & gt c : thank you i just wanted to discuss my experience here today 
 uh oh 
 in my experience customers only ask to speak to a manager if they want to complain about an employee or some perceived injustice 
 at this point i 'm <unk> our interaction in my head trying to pinpoint exactly what had happened that upset her 
 as she made her way to the cs counter i began to clean my <unk> trying to <unk> keep an eye on the conversation between her and my boss 
 though just barely in my <unk> <unk> i saw the woman point a finger in my direction causing my heart to momentarily stop 
 my manager nodded some kind of agreement and the woman walked out of the store 
 at this point i was terrified worried that i had said or done something worthy of being reprimanded without even realizing it 
 i looked over at my manager giving her a <unk> look doing my best to remain cool 
 she made her way towards me every <unk> causing anxious beads of sweat to gather around my collar 
 & gt m : <unk> the most nonchalant tone i could <unk> what was that all about 
 & gt manager : well she just wanted to tell me that you were doing a great job and that she wished everyone she met was as friendly and enjoyable as you and that this is her favorite high-end grocery location because of how helpful our staff is 
 so keep up the good work 
 relief washed over me so quickly i felt dizzy 
 & gt m : that was sweet of her 
 i thought i 'd managed to piss her off somehow 
 & gt manager : i thought you looked worried haha 
 she also wanted me to give you this 
 she handed me a gift card with a small hand-written note folded around it 
 the note read : thank you for making me smile 
 enjoy lunch on me today 
 god bless '' 
 even writing this story i still ca n't believe anyone could capable of being so generous $ 15 gift card 
 that 's lunch all week 
 and appreciative of just a few nice words and a smile 
 it 's always nice to know that not everyone thinks of retail workers as <unk> drones put upon this earth to serve them 
 tl dr : i was nice to a customer and she payed for my lunch for a week 
 this is another tfr of my time at sub restaurant 
 i had been there a little under a year and had become the opener 
 basically this meant that i was there about 2 hours before we opened with the manager on duty - usually the store manager 
 this new girl ng had been hired over summer break and this was her first job 
 obviously we did n't expect her to know much about working a job and told her that small mistakes were fine so long as she learned from them 
 well ... we were in for a fun ride 
 **day 1** ng requested to come in at 1:00 instead of the usual time of <unk> because she had one last class to finish 
 no problem 
 lunch rush will be done and there will be plenty of <unk> to train her 
 she arrived at <unk> saying her car broke down and she had to get a ride 
 no problem 
 sometimes thing just happen that are out of our control 
 rest of the day goes by without incident 
 **day 2** ng calls off because she needs to go get her car fixed 
 usually not a problem because again things happen and she needed that car to get to work 
 problem was she called 15 minutes after she was scheduled to come in 
 **day 3** we are finally able to start some real training 
 i am showing ng how to do stuff in the back of the house 
 the things the customers do n't want to see and we are making small talk 
 i mention that i am the opener and she hits me with this ... & gt ng : i think i would be a great opener 
 this job does n't seem too hard 
 & gt me : i was here a year before they would even consider letting me be the opener 
 first thing you need to do is learn these lower jobs and prove you can do them 
 **day <unk> friday 
 our busy day 
 ng was going to be our sub <unk> - easiest job in the store call name and sub and bring to table - so myself and the more experienced employees could focus on making the subs 
 she calls and says she ca n't make it because her friend invited her to a party 
 when did she call 
 20 minutes *before her shift was supposed to end 
 * at this point the store manager was ready to fire her but decided to give her another chance 
 **day <unk> ng calls about an hour before her shift - progress at last 
 sarcasm - to tell us she ca n't make it that day 
 well that is it 
 the store manager has had it 
 so she tells ng that she is fired 
 she can not be counted on for anything and that she needs to learn how to work before she can get a job 
 ng begs for one last chance 
 the store manager agrees but tells her that if she calls off again that she is fired 
 **day 6** yep ... you guessed it 
 called off about an hour into her scheduled shift 
 when she dropped off her uniform she said she had no idea why she was fired 
 & gt ng : i mean i ca n't be expected to just end my social life 
 my friends are more important than any job 
 why ca n't the store manager see that 
 & gt me : ... get out 
 just get out 
 that experience made me die a little inside 
 tl dr : girl calls off 4 out of the 6 days she officially worked for the restaurant and <unk> why she got fired 
 update : wow 
 never thought this story would be so popular 
 edit : <unk> again tfr 
 the more grocery-store cashiers i read about the more memories i am reminded of during my years in that special circle of hell 
 i was reminded of my very favorite hated customer 
 as i mentioned in my bad shrimp '' story earlier - our grocery store had a very lenient policy on returning food 
 the day steak man arrived was the day it was truly tested 
 & gt sm : hello i would like to return some steaks they were too fatty 
 & gt me : certainly do you have your receipt 
 & gt sm : in a challenging tone no i do not 
 & gt me : okay that 's alright do you have the steaks 
 & gt sm : no 
 they were too fatty 
 they were about $ 40 can you just give me that 
 & gt me : well 
 sir i ca n't process your return if i have no proof of you purchasing the steak 
 anything would do 
 even the <unk> packaging 
 & gt sm : are you stupid or something 
 no 
 we cooked the steaks yesterday ate them and realized they were too fatty 
 they were new york strips 
 i decide to ignore the fact that ny strips are known for well the strip of fat along the side and pick the better <unk> fruit & gt me : sir let me make sure i get this : you bought steaks cooked them ate them in their entirety then decided afterwards you wanted a refund 
 & gt sm : yes 
 they were about $ 40 cash please 
 & gt me : sorry <unk> you ate the steaks and have no receipt or proof of purchase i can not refund you i am sorry was not sorry 
 for purposes of length i wo n't go further but we spent a solid 10 minutes 200 years in retail-life going back and forth on this return 
 finally the manager is free to come over and talk to steak man 
 manager explains the same thing to steak man and apologies is not sorry 
 steak man does this weird <unk> scream and storms away 
 you would think that would be the end of it right 
 of course not 
 five minutes later i see steak man making a beeline for my counter 
 & gt sm : i want a refund the soda machine ate my dollar 
 & gt me : sorry sir we have no control over the vending machines 
 i did not know it was acting up so i 'll go put an <unk> sign but you 'll have to take up the refund with & lt vending machine company & gt 
 sm proceeds to fly off the handle in a rage talking about how we 're trying to scam him that we <unk> the soda machine *on <unk> to get him back for just trying to get a refund 
 threats to management threats to corporate <unk> 
 as he 's ranting i reached for my wallet 
 & gt sm : what are you doing 
 & gt me : & lt pulls out $ 1 and hands it to sm & gt here sir 
 if i give you a dollar will you leave 
 you will have nothing left to complain about and this is getting exhausting 
 mr. steak man smugly 
 took my dollar and left without a word 
 i never saw him again after that 
 **tl dr paid a customer to leave me alone 
 ** edit : linked my story thanks for the tip this is why i hate <unk> year old girls even though i was one of them at one time years ago 
 i 'm a manager at a local clothing store here and at the age of 24 i feel like i 'm not as inpatient with younger customers as the older people are that work there 
 so there i was standing at the front desk because we were short handed and i watched the desk to let the other girl take lunch 
 nothing is really happening besides a group of young teen girls come in with 2 older women who i assumed was moms and i pay no attention to them because what problems could they really cause 
 i see them just grabbing all types of clothes and going to try them on 
 they come out and continue browsing our wonderful selection but did n't bring the clothes back out with them 
 a pain in my ass but not really that big of a deal and i was in a good mood that day 
 out of the corner of my eye i see them taking shirts holding them up to see how they would look and then <unk> them onto the floor 
 but i am still in a good mood so i simply say hey '' to get their attention and when they look at me i simply say do n't do that c'mon be cool '' 
 5 minutes later i see them doing the same shit so i walk over and tell them that if they do n't stop i will have no choice but to make them leave 
 nothing was getting me down that day 
 a few more minutes pass and i see them kind of hiding behind displays and they are doing the same exact shit 
 i mean c'mon 
 i spot their mothers on the other side of the store so i figure i will stop it all right now by going over their head 
 i approach these woman and this is the conversation : <unk> 1 <unk> 2 me : excuse me ladies 
 m1 : oh we do n't need any help me : ok but i am here to tell you that the young ladies you came in here with are about to be kicked out if they do n't stop throwing the merchandise in the floor 
 simple enough 
 i walk back to the desk and see them approaching the teenage brats and i go about my business 
 m1 and m2 approach the desk and have some pissed off looks on their faces 
 m2 : how dare you tell these girls that you would kick them out of the store me : i told them to stop twice m1 : it still gives you no right m2 : this is n't your store i want to speak with the manager me : ok then how can i help you 
 m1 : by getting the manager me : that 's me m2 : you know you do n't have to be such a smart ass 
 all you had to do was watch the girls and they probably would n't have done it me : but that 's not my job 
 m1 : yeah well we are leaving right now and we will not ever come back here again you lost 2 customers 
 me : have a nice day 
 : this is the reason i hate teenagers and their stupid parents not all parents just the stupid ones but it always helps to smile as you wave goodbye even when they give you the finger 
 so i used to work in a store that sold used comic books 
 a great <unk> of used comics 
 sometimes our stock would get so <unk> that we would clear them out with a buy ten get ten free '' deal 
 they were all $ 1- $ 2 so it 's not like we lost that much in sales 
 it was a good way to clear inventory 
 as you can imagine comic nerds like myself saw it as a great way to get 20 comics for $ 10 
 and some comic nerds not like myself saw it as a chance to get 100 comics for $ 50 
 a customer rolls in with his mountain of white <unk> comics from the <unk> 's and i stare down the tower 
 then i stare at him 
 impressed that he would go through the effort of sorting through the bins to draw such a massive amount 
 i know that this would be a test 
 a test of my <unk> and a customer 's patience 
 then i tell him the bad news 
 i 'm going to have to scan all of these individually '' 
 you see our used comics are n't all under one single barcode 
 there are several scattered about and in order to keep inventory clear we have to scan every comic as a separate line item 
 if i just scanned one and set it as 100 it would create a massive <unk> in our inventory 
 he looks at me and he tells me i understand '' 
 a <unk> to be sure 
 for even good men have their breaking points 
 so i start scanning 
 ten normally then ten that i have to go and manually reduce the price to <unk> one by one 
 ten normal 
 ten reduced 
 ten normal 
 ten reduced 
 at around <unk> comics scanned in our old <unk> windows <unk> register system ... <unk> 
 freezes up 
 i 'll have to redo the entire ticket 
 rescan all those comics i had sorted into neat piles 
 i look at the customer and i tell him 
 i 'm sorry my system crashed 
 i 'm gon na have to redo all of this '' 
 i await the fury 
 the cursing the anger the impatience 
 it would be justified 
 it 's taken a long time to even come this far and i had barely crossed the halfway point 
 however he looks at me his eyes <unk> with visions of 80 's <unk> and 90 's batman and he tells me 
 alright '' 
 and here my friends i tell you that on this day in a transaction that took over 30 minutes to clear a customer did not lose their patience nor blame a sales associate for technical malfunctions 
 on this day a customer knew the great burden they were pushing onto a sales associate and said let my quiet understanding be the support to help you through this difficult time '' 
 in a world where others may fly into a rage over a <unk> credit card there was one who understood 
 on this day a customer and a sales associate became brothers in blood 
 <unk> purchaser of 100 comics 
 may your boxes bulge with paper and ink 
 may your shelves grow heavy and buckle under the weight of <unk> work in an adult shop in a predominantly gay area of my city 
 i have done a few stories 
 you can find them here todays tale is kind of hard 
 it was one that really <unk> at my heart strings and left me wondering if i could have done more 
 i have a pretty laid back and accepting attitude to people and to sexuality 
 i have friends who are gay lesbian <unk> etc 
 i suppose this comes in handy in my job and in the area of town in which i work but events over the last few weeks have left me wishing that i could do more 
 still not sure what <unk> i could have done though 
 a couple of weeks ago two young men 20 and 21 entered the shop 
 we got to chatting and one bought a few items 
 came up in the conversation that they were part of the furry community 
 furries are a community of people who like to become animal alter <unk> of sorts 
 they have an animal that is their 'other side 
 this may involve sex play 
 one of the young men was very vocal about his sexual exploits but the other young man was very quiet and <unk> 
 kind of out of nowhere the quiet young man who shall be henceforth be known as furry said 'i do n't really like sex 
 me 'really 
 furry 'no i just do n't get any <unk> out of it 
 me 'well you are still young 
 you just may not have found the things you like yet 
 furry 'i do n't like sex 
 i am only ever comfortable in my furry outfit 
 in fact i hate my penis 
 ok then ... what does one say to this 
 me 'so i suppose in your outfit you can just be <unk> 
 you do n't have to be a boy 
 you can just be your character 
 right 
 furry 'hey you get it 
 yeah that is exactly how it is 
 me <unk> i suppose if you hate your penis why would you want to be involved in an act like sex in which it plays kinda the main role 
 furry 'hey you really do get it 
 me <unk> have you ever heard of gender identity issues 
 furry 'yeah and before you say more yeah i think i do have some issues 
 me 'have you talked to someone about it 
 furry 'no not really 
 it 's kind of hard 
 how do you talk about this to someone 
 me 'i think you should 
 and it should be someone other than an old broad like me in an adult shop 
 you do know that there are places around here where you can talk to people just like you do n't you 
 you are not alone in this 
 furry 'yeah i suppose 
 me 'how about your family 
 have you spoken to them 
 furry 'no 
 it is kind of hard you know 
 me 'yeah i get it but i really think you should get some help because it sounds to me like you are talking sex change 
 am i getting this right 
 furry 'yeah you are 
 i really want to be a girl 
 i want my penis gone 
 it should n't be there 
 i went to my trusty smart phone and immediately looked up a few numbers i knew for groups and help 
 gave him all the details and made him promise to call and talk to someone 
 before he left the shop i came out from behind my counter and he extended his hand to thank me 
 i pulled him into a hug and said 'hey i am a <unk> as i gave him a big hug 
 his face lit up and he said 'so am i 
 well today he came back 
 he was alone this time and came to tell me that he has his first appointment with a counselor tomorrow 
 he plans at this stage to go through the entire gender <unk> process 
 who knows it may change with counseling but at least he is getting some help and has someone a little more qualified to talk to than me 
 he also told me his girls name that he <unk> to use 
 it was a lovely name 
 edit : wow i did not expect this response and to the person who gave me gold i am ever so grateful 
 actually got tears in my eyes reading the comments 
 and to have this reposted in the furry subreddit as well 
 reddit is just awesome and again thanks ... ... edit 2. just in the door from work and am amazed at the response this has received 
 i sincerely thank all those who have made such lovely comments about me 
 i just wanted to give some background about myself 
 i have grown up with a lot of <unk> friends 
 i have been lucky in life in this regard because it has taught me tolerance and <unk> 
 not just of people 's sexual <unk> but of all things in life 
 this when i have two brothers who are homophobic and racist and a mother who still asks me why i hang around with <unk> kinds of people 
 i am also lucky in that my gorgeous man is the same as me 
 i have lost friends to aids and have friends who are <unk> positive 
 i have lost friends to suicide because they thought no one was there for them when they <unk> out 
 my attitude has also helped with my current job 
 ok. it is a pretty dead end job in many respects but it does allow me to meet some really amazing people 
 i was looking out at the rainbow flags lining the street where i work today and thinking about the comments i had read this morning and i was wishing the world was more like reddit 
 you all seem to be so accepting 
 spread the love people 
 listen to your friends 
 give them a shoulder to cry on or a hug if they need it 
 celebrate <unk> people because lets face it if we were all the same the world would be an <unk> boring place 
 i work as an assistant manager for a local business that has done pretty well throughout the years we have a couple locations in <unk> areas 
 we do a lot of buy/sell/trade so we do n't always attract the most pleasant customers 
 today i was helping a older gentleman in his <unk> and during the entire time he kept slipping in little remarks about my appearance about how beautiful i was 
 i just kept ignoring him or cutting him off with work related questions 
 finally he 's ready to check out 
 so i ring him up and i 'm the process of handing his cash back when he comments to my coworker : i do n't know how you could get any work done with such a beautiful woman distracting you 
 if i were you i 'd have her in the back bent over ... '' i stopped him there 
 i told him he had found the line and crossed it that he was being disrespectful and offensive 
 he told me so 
 you 're a woman and i 'm a man that 's what we do '' 
 me : regardless of how you feel you do n't need to vocalize it its offensive and i have no interest in hearing it 
 please take your things and leave you are no longer welcome at my store '' 
 he stormed off in a huff oblivious to any wrong he had <unk> work for a restaurant chain 
 my job at this chain is to go around to tables make sure their tv 's are on the right channel make nice with the customers and provide backup for servers 
 so i 'm doing my thing enjoying my evening when my manager comes up to me and discreetly motions toward a table in the dining room and tells me to make sure that that table is happy and attended to the entire time that they are there 
 so i walk over and give my usual huge hello and smile and ask them how they are doing the response : were about ready to walk out '' says the father 
 the mother says nothing the kids say nothing 
 well im sorry to hear that and im gon na do everything i can to make sure the rest of your visit is fantastic '' i say 
 i like bad customers 
 i <unk> on them 
 a good challenge provides some <unk> to the day 
 i 'm ready for this 
 i check on them about once every five minutes for the next half an hour 
 each time i go check on this table i get a dirty look from the dad and an increasingly cheerful yet still dismissive response from the mom 
 thats cool as long as they 're happy im happy 
 i take pride in my job and as long as they are enjoying themselves its no skin off my nose 
 so i go to another table and start <unk> them were getting a good conversation going and as im talking i feel a kid tug on my arm and tells me he wants to take the challenge 
 boom i think 
 this family is willing to pay to let their six year old eat obnoxiously hot chicken wings therefore they are enjoying themselves therefore we have <unk> our way out of the woods '' 
 i excuse myself from the table i was talking to and approach the original family with the required waiver 
 they sign it 
 5 minutes later the wings come out of the deep fryer 
 normally i make it my goal to leave no more than about 180 seconds between deep fryer and mouth when it comes to this challenge but this kid looks about six years old and im gon na give him a break so i let those wings sit for a good 5 or 6 more minutes to cool down 
 i lay the wings down on the table hop on the microphone rally the restaurant 
 attention <unk> chicken wings chain restaurant we have our first non <unk> hot chicken wings challenge of the night tell them how old you are bud '' 
 i hold the microphone to the kids face which i never do but i figure im going all out for this table 
 if i keep this up i might get a kudos email and he goes im six years old '' 
 the restaurant goes nuts 
 this could not be going better 
 this kid is <unk> as hell they are getting all kinds of good attention from the whole dining room and restaurant 
 were good 
 i start the timer the kid takes one bite and gives up 
 i 'm not <unk> at all 
 but all of a sudden the mom starts insisting that the wings were too hot temperature hot and that it wasnt fair 
 so i offer to let him try again with the same wing basket once they cool down but the kids done 
 so mom decides its her turn 
 by the way we never ever ever ever ever let people attempt the challenge when someone has already tried with that basket 
 its not fair to other challengers but at this point im willing to do anything to keep this family happy 
 so here i am back on the microphone alright guys carlito is done challenging for the night but thats okay because his mom gladys is gon na take up the <unk> and finish them for him '' 
 again crowd : nuts 
 still killing the game 
 i hit the timer she takes one bite 
 done 
 hop on the <unk> again and get both carlito and gladys two more rounds of <unk> 
 i come back about ten minutes later to hand out some high fives and <unk> them for trying and the mom tells me that it would absolutely make this kids day if he could get a t shirt just for trying '' the t shirts are for people who actually do the challenge and i have definitely told people who missed their time on the stop watch by all of about 2 seconds that they would be going home shirtless but for this lady i went and asked my manager who gave me the go ahead 
 i come back with the shirt display it proudly for the table they are all smiling and i give it to the kid 
 the kid was happy 
 but now his brother and sister want to try for the shirt 
 i immediately see where this is going 
 this lady is about to make me sit there and watch each of her kids take one bite of spicy wings give them each a shirt and if not then shes gon na fuss 
 i tell her no unfortunately its against the rules for me to let more than one person attempt the challenge on one basket of wings 
 and she goes with kind of a <unk> '' smirk were just trying to save you guys wings is all '' 
 and then it hits me 
 this lady things that the challenge is free 
 its not 
 its not even free if you finish your wings on time 
 i have never suggested on the microphone or at any point that its free 
 and the waiver that she has now signed twice has disclosed that she will be paying for it 
 nothing nobody no where has made any <unk> that these wings are free 
 and im about to get lit up for it when shes figures it out 
 so in preparation i retreat to the kitchen because i 've run out of ideas 
 by the time i come back out this table is looking angrily at their tickets 
 i try to <unk> by them on my lap around the dining room but she stops me and demands why were n't we disclosed that we would be charged for the challenge '' at this point my creativity is about <unk> so i just say its on the waiver you signed '' 
 instead of so let me get this straight you thought the wings were free even though nobody here even finished them under which circumstances it might be understandable that you would think you might get free wings but because you signed a waiver you acknowledge that that is not the case and you 're still walking out of here with a t shirt that you didnt earn '' 
 i hand the dad the waiver he goes up to my manager and hands her his ticket with cash and twenty dollars missing and says if you dont like this you can shove it wherever you want '' 
 which causes my manager to calmly and cooly ask one of the cashiers to get down their license plate info 
 say what you want about this manager 
 shes not popular 
 but she 's certainly no easy <unk> 
 five minutes later gladys is back in the restaurant with a twenty dollar bill in her hand <unk> like a mom who is afraid to get arrested for theft in front of her kids 
 just take the money we dont want any confrontation we have our kids in the car '' 
 last thing i hear my manager say just as calmly is : keep your money 
 we wont call the police but we still reserve the right to refuse service '' 
 here 's a tale from the customer side 
 i worked retail for many years and know the big box '' system pretty well 
 i always have a receipt for my returns exercise patience with new people and say thank you to those that help me 
 i never thought i would have to resort to violence 
 yesterday was i was wrong 
 i am at a very busy home <unk> store that has two returns lines 
 it is father 's day and the store is packed 
 my return is a snap ring plier set that broke on first use 
 i was just going to exchange it for the same product 
 i had my receipt and had waited about 10 minutes in line for my turn 
 three people in front of me was a <unk> gentleman of color 
 he was returning a sump pump that was not working 
 it was also covered in what looked to be <unk> sewage and smelled horrible 
 the guy did not have a receipt and they called up the plumbing manager for assistance 
 this took a good five minutes and the guy was starting to get more and more agitated 
 the manager arrived and got his story 
 his sewer line broke and backed up into his basement 
 he was using a standard sump pump used for keeping ground water pumped out to pump out raw sewage 
 this wo n't work as it is not designed for that 
 the manager explained this and looked at the pump 
 it was not even one they sold 
 he did n't buy it there 
 the manager said there was nothing they could do for him except sell him a sewage pump 
 the guy did n't take this well and started screaming profanities and questioning the plumbing manager 's mother 's <unk> 
 the manager walked away and left the guy there with his horrible smelling pump 
 the next two people get thier returns done and the guy is still there getting madder and muttering something under his breath 
 it 's my turn for returns and the cashier is visibly upset and shaking 
 the other return person called for a store manager 
 as i 'm starting my return the guy interrupts and yells bitch get the fucking manager up here before i start killing mutha <unk> 's up in here '' 
 he is litterally less than two feet from me 
 i turned and said hey there is no need for that 
 he then said <unk> <unk> with you '' and reached under his shirt 
 i snapped and hit him square in the face 
 he dropped everything and was on the floor 
 i got on top of him and pinned his arms down 
 another customer ran over and from behind me sees a gun in his <unk> and grabs it to keep it away from the guy 
 the manager arrived and some others had already called 911. i stayed on top the guy for a good 20 minutes until the police arrived 
 in that time the guy tried everything to get away 
 he struggled threatened me my family tried kicking out anything but i kept him pinned 
 the police got there and <unk> him and me 
 once witnesses got the police informed of the real story i was let go 
 come to find out this guy was a gang member with two warrants for two separate <unk> 
 he likely would have killed me and a few others with me 
 they said he likely would n't be prosecuted for this incident since he has two murder charges already 
 happy father 's day 
 tl dr : stopped a shooting at the hardware <unk> time lurker first time poster in talesfromretail 
 i 'm sure most people in this sub know by now but for those who do n't in the uk as of october 2015 any business with over 250 employees have to charge 5p for plastic bags 
 so i work in a store in the uk that sells games accessories and things of that nature 
 i had just finished serving a lady who was buying sims 3 on 360 for her daughter transaction was smooth said thanks and they left 
 about 30 seconds later a guy comes in with the game presumably to be a husband 
 lawyer guy : got a bag for this 
 me : sure it 'll be 5p lawyer guy : no it wo n't i 'll take one for free me : i 'm afraid i ca n't as its against the law we have to charge for them 
 lawyer guy : you ca n't charge me if the bag has the companies logo on it not true i 'm a lawyer i know about these things 
 me : still have to charge you 5p 
 lawyer guy : fine i 'll have a refund then 
 me : sure if you have the receipt so i can process it through the till 
 he then walks outside the shop and gives the game to his wife who i had served previously she walks in and asks is it 5p '' 
 so i told her he wanted a refund and she rolled her eyes sighed paid for the bag said thanks and walked out 
 the one thing that baffled me out of all of this is why would you <unk> to me that you 're a lawyer earning god knows how much money whilst complaining about something so trivial as a 5p bag 
 i am a courtesy clerk at a grocery store 
 i was sweeping the floor when a customer asked me if i could get him some bottles from the liquor cabinet 
 i smile and escort him to the alcohol isle 
 once there i follow the policies like normal stand between him and the liquor once opened never let go of the bottle and close the cabinet immediately 
 after doing all this i turn around to inform him that i have to bring the bottle directly to the check stand and he can meet me there to purchase it 
 i 'm unable to finish my sentence before receiving a swift left hook to the face 
 i was out for only about 3 seconds 
 the first thing i see after i look up is my <unk> lying face down a few feet away from me the bottle smashed all over the floor 
 my managers and the security guard check up on me and grab the very <unk> shoplifter 
 now here 's the kicker about an hour later we 're checking camera 's to figure out what happened and : after punching me the guy tried to run and tripped on my leg falling face first and knocking himself out 
 <unk> worked for fast food chain several years ago 
 i was on the closing crew 
 my location would stop taking new orders at 9:30 and close the doors at <unk> this particular night was n't interesting just cleaning up the dining room as the last few stragglers left 
 it was 10:00 so i decided to start locking up 
 as i 'm closing the front door a car screeches into the parking lot 
 a woman jumps out and charges towards the entrance flailing her arms and yelling <unk> 
 i had already removed the <unk> so the door was slowly swinging closed 
 at the last second the screaming lady sl jams her foot in the door to prevent it from closing 
 sl : <unk> '' 
 me : uh ... i 'm sorry ma'am but we close at 10 '' 
 sl : but it 's not 10:00 
 see '' 
 she shoves her phone in my face 
 the display reads <unk> i do n't say anything 
 the cashier girl cg up front is watching this exchange with amusement 
 sl shoves past me and <unk> half-trips her way to the front counter 
 sl : i want a sandwich '' 
 cg : ma'am we 're closed '' 
 sl : but it 's only <unk> '' 
 at this point it 's <unk> cg explains that the grills are turned off the bread has been put away the dishes have been cleaned and the kitchen crew is going home 
 sl grumbles under her breath and asks if she can use the bathroom 
 after she left i found that she had <unk> the entire roll of toilet paper and smeared <unk> all over the counter and <unk> lurker first time poster 
 let me preface this story by explaining somethings 
 i 'm a biker beard long hair tattoos leather jacket the works

 i put out my cigarette and walk in the store and then behind the counter making eye contact with the embarrassed kids

 maybe her friends will let her ride in their new cars cause she will be taking the bus 
 and she 'll need to get a job now to pay for that 
 & gt sb eyes wide : i 'm sorry daddy i want the car now ... & gt dad : too late sb 
 you just <unk> yourself into a hole 
 better ask your mom in two weeks when she gets back from italy 
 sb proceeded to run outside crying while her dad shook my hand 
 oddly i felt something <unk> into my palm and i looked down to find that he shoved a hundred dollar bill in there 
 & gt dad : that 's for wasting your time and costing you money 
 but that spoiled girl is n't getting a car from me 
 let her <unk> get her one 
 & gt me : thanks 
 i definitely appreciate it 
 and best of luck 
 he walked out and got into his car then they both took off again 
 not two weeks later the spoiled brat came back and was driving a broken down old <unk> 
 turns out that that is the car her new dad got her paid a whopping $ 500 for it and it needed service 
 she did n't even look at me as she walked in 
 score : awesome dad - 1,000,000 points <unk> sb - one hefty repair bill 
 edit : it was indeed a 328xi coupe 
 i sell new mazdas so bmw naming <unk> are beyond me.hey tfr 
 i 've got a good one for you today and i still get giddy thinking about it 
 i work at a bank and this occurred about four years ago 
 we had a customer come in slightly upset : someone had broken into his car and stolen only a few checks from his checkbook and had immediately gone on a spending <unk> at nearby grocery stores the kind where they use your check to pull the funds out immediately identical to a debit card 
 our manager immediately refunded the lost money and put a * '' warning '' * on his account telling us not to cash any check <unk> from 1001 to 1010 : the numbers of the stolen checks 
 he was assured that any more money he lost would be refunded 
 he did n't want to close the account which is what i would have recommended because it takes a while to get new checks and cards and he did n't want to go through all the trouble 
 not 2 days later we have what 's called a <unk> walk in meaning they do n't have an account at that bank but still have transactions to run most often cashing checks 
 i 'm currently covering for several coworkers lunches so i 'm the only teller covering the lobby 
 he walks up to me hands me a check and his i.d. and tells me he wants to cash it 
 alright cool let me just check <unk> -- whoa wait a minute 
 *this is a check that was stolen from that customer a few days ago 
 * i doubled and triple checked my suspicions and i was rewarded with numerous red flags : • the check number was within the stolen range 1001 to 1010 • the signature was <unk> forged and was easily the most <unk> evidence • the amount of the check was for an <unk> high amount based on the babysitting job '' description scrawled down in the <unk> line the check was for $ 3000 
 we the tellers had been instructed to call the police in the event that anyone ever came in an presented a forged check and also had strong reason to believe that the person in front of us had done the <unk> 
 the dude in front of me was covered from head to toe with tattoos smelled like an ashtray dressed in the dirtiest clothes you can imagine and had the words fuck off '' tattooed on his right forearm in very large very <unk> letters 
 in other words i was calling bullshit on him cashing a $ 3000 check based on his babysitting work 
 so i needed to call the police but how 
 there was no way this guy would stick around the second i picked up the phone and accused him of stealing a check not to mention the fact that this guy actually looked fairly dangerous 
 normal protocol said that i need a manager to verify the check '' at which point i would go to the back room and call the cops -- and stay back there leaving the customer at the counter getting frustrated and suspicious 
 so i <unk> : i started angrily hitting the <unk> on my keyboard and muttered loud enough for the thief to hear me come on not again '' 
 when he looked <unk> at me i <unk> and said sorry my system just froze up 
 we 've been having trouble with this stupid thing all day 
 let me see if i can get someone else to do it '' 
 i gave a <unk> look at my only other coworker who fortunately picked up on what i was doing immediately and complained that sure enough her system went down too 
 i looked back up at the thief and apologized in a half-laugh <unk> that his wait would be a few minutes because our entire network had just gone down 
 **he totally bought it ** even going so far as to say something like damn computers they never work when you need them too hahaha '' 
 i agreed and told him i 'd go back in the back room to get his cash ready if nothing else 
 i called the police explained the situation to them and they assured me a cop was on his way to our location fast 
 i hung up and called our corporate office and let them know what was happening and they assured me that i was doing the right thing and that they were sending the bank lawyer to our location asap and to be safe '' 
 i then called our branch manager who was on lunch at this time and then the customer and let them both know what was going on and that we 'd keep them <unk> 
 once i was done with this stuff -- i walked back out to the counter and walked right back up to the thief apologized again for his wait assuring him that we had our it department working <unk> on the situation and would he like a free soda to compensate for the wait 
 he like that so i went and got him one 
 5 minutes later and i was sweating bullets at this point my body was swimming in adrenaline the cop walked in directly behind the thief who was completely unaware of the whole situation 
 i made eye contact with the cop nodded and then nodded again towards the thief 
 long story short : the thief turned around and completely went <unk> at the sight of cop 
 he admitted to stealing the checks almost instantly and was promptly placed into handcuffs right there in our lobby 
 our bank lawyer who was on the phone with the customer who 'd had his checks stolen and branch manager walked in a few minutes later after that 
 after the thief was <unk> off i was told i had done well by upper management 
 **the best part 
 ** saying that our system was down became the <unk> go-to excuse whenever tellers needed to stall for time in order to call the police 
 <unk> one night i am working the returns desk at my big-box hardware job when i see this girl <unk> my way pushing a flatbed with 4 five gallon <unk> of paint 
 at this exact moment i get a call from paint : spoon 
 you see that girl coming to the desk right now 
 i literally watched her and her buddy load those on the cart in paint 
 lp and management is tracking her friend right now 
 stall '' 
 <unk> this is my first red flag to a fraud return 
 let the games begin 
 so of course when she reaches the desk she has no receipt and driver license in hand 
 oh your dad is a contractor and misguessed how much white paint he needed 
 he paid in cash but does n't mind gift card '' 
 right 
 that is a totally <unk> excuse i hear all the time 
 red flag number two 
 of course when i scan them the amount comes out to over the limit 
 a manager is needed to approve so i go ahead and page for one 
 she totally starts sweating bullets 
 she asks if i can break down the transactions so i do n't need the approval but still put them on the same gift card 
 ah ... there it is 
 red flag number three 
 you 've done this enough times to know how the system works 
 <unk> 
 nope 
 i can not <unk> process a transaction like that to avoid manager approval 
 do n't worry though 
 as soon as my manager is done with your friend he will come up here to deal with you '' 
 <unk> 
 she <unk> and <unk> the store 
 her buddy realizes his ride is gone only when he tries to <unk> lp into the parking lot with his <unk> 
 police come shortly after 
 but wait 
 you left so fast that you left your id with all your info at the desk 
 i was nice enough to give it to the cops so they could return it to you personally 
 i do n't want you to walk away from our little game empty-handed 
 have a lovely evening a previous job of mine was cashier and occasional stock boy at a party supply store 
 i especially <unk> the register on saturday mornings when moms rushed the store in <unk> to <unk> bundles of filled balloons for their precious flowers <unk> 
 the first incident took place on a weekday evening when most balloon orders seem to be placed 
 a mom who had separated from her gaggle of other ladies and children walked up to the balloon counter 
 nobody was there 
 so i walked over to help her 
 can i help you '' 
 i asked in my nicest customer service voice 
 i need some of those um silvery balloons '' she replied 
 ah the mylar balloons 
 do you have a <unk> in mind '' 
 she examined the wall of flat balloons to find one that she thought fit the theme of her son 's party 
 her first choice was # # 
 sorry ma'am it seems to be sold out '' 
 she chose another 
 sorry ma'am that one is also sold out '' 
 in a snarky tone i 'm asked : do you have any balloons '' she looks at my name tag <unk> or are you just yankin my chain '' 
 i assure you we have balloons 
 you need to pick one that does n't have a <unk> out sticker on it '' 
 she replied with a sigh of exasperation and finally chose one we have in stock i filled out the order form and that was that 
 upon returning to my register the display directly across from me <unk> <unk> party plates cups <unk> etc. was in complete <unk> 
 the racks had been pulled down cups and <unk> candy were all over the floor loose ones that did n't come in bulk bags and toys were misplaced 
 that balloon lady 's kid about twelve or thirteen years old standing quite close with an item from the display in his hand had simply destroyed the display 
 i 'd have to stay overtime to fix it up 
 i asked the child if he planned on cleaning it up but he replied with a snooty it 's your job i 'm not doing it '' 
 his mom eventually comes up and i let her know what her kid did to which she replied you know kids right '' 
 <unk> 
 it 's not too difficult to clean up right 
 son of a ... fine 
 whatever 
 like mother like kid right 
 a few days pass and i 'm back at my register 
 this being a saturday morning before opening i had two things to do : 1 help blow up balloons and <unk> ribbons and 2 clean the windows and sweep the floors 
 after helping with the balloons i went up to the windows and removed the signs from in front of and off of the doors and windows to clean them 
 i had just finished with the doors and moved onto the windows when the customers began to arrive the minute the store opened 
 many moms with their demonic spawn in tow entered the store and balloon lady and snooty child were amongst them 
 she walks over to the counter to get her balloon bundle and her kid is left to his own devices 
 that 's when i hear the loudest bang 
 of my life 
 i turned to see the kid falling backward onto the ground 
 no response from mom 
 he touches his forehead and to his <unk> a minor amount of blood is found 
 the kid had run straight into the window beside the door you push open 
 now his mom was super concerned about her child and what he had been doing 
 she is helping him up and asks me in a commanding way what happened '' 
 i received a warning for my remark but it was worth it : dunno 
 that 's your job '' 
 edit : grammar tl dr : my <unk> window cleaning skills completely wrecked some <unk> here 's my contribution to the world of crazy that is retail 
 <unk> tl dr me to the jury in federal court : yes it was the man in the light blue suit sitting over there '' when i was in high school over 15 years ago now i worked at a copy/ship place 
 i worked there for 6 years and had a lot of fun 
 i got very good at shipping <unk> items with the <unk> being a roughly 24 '' x18 '' x18 '' <unk> house 
 it arrived with only a gum drop tree that fell over 
 they faxed us a picture because they were astonished it arrived in one piece 
 but that 's not what this story is about 
 one day an older gentleman came into our store 
 he needed to overnight a set of keys that his daughter left when she was in town 
 not an uncommon request 
 just a simple set of keys with the cars keyless remote 
 we package up the keys the gentleman decides that he wants to put them keys in a small padded envelope before putting them in the tyvex fedex envelope 
 i slap on the label and the man pays and leaves 
 i offered all the normal insurance options but he decided the standard $ 100 was enough as they could just get keys remade 
 pretty uneventful transaction but i specifically remembered him putting the keys in the padded envelope and then into the tyvex envelope to keep them safe as he was worried that the cardboard envelopes could get torn open with the <unk> package inside 
 the keys are then off to california 
 a few days later the man returns and needs to file a claim the package had not yet arrived 
 i had been working in this store for roughly 2 years at this point and we had never had a package that was n't eventually found by the various carriers 
 so called fedex to get a trace started on the package and informed the man that we would likely get a call back in 24 hours and we would call him as soon as we heard something 
 the next day i get a call from fedex that the <unk> envelope was found but the contents were missing 
 this is literally the only package that i sent in 6 years of sending stuff with fedex and ups that actually went missing 
 i called the gentleman and had him come back in to start the claim process to get his money to get the keys remade 
 this is where the fun begins 
 when the man returns he fills out the insurance claim paperwork and lists the contents as : keys car remote diamond earrings $ 500 cash 
 in seeing this i confront the man and let him know that since he did n't list the earrings '' on the original shipping info it would n't be covered and that cash is also not covered 
 and since he only accepted the basic insurance he would not be getting anything over that 
 got the standard but this is what was actually in it '' response even though i know <unk> he is lying 
 oddly enough this was the last time i saw the old man until a few months later 
 the story starts to get some <unk> at this point so take an adventure with me to my junior year prom i took an awesome friend from a regional youth drug and alcohol <unk> group that i was part of 
 she lived about an hour away from me and after dropping her off at home after prom i know.. i was a good <unk> it sucked 
 i was heading down the highway tired as heck at 3am 2 exits from my dad 's house where i was going to crash when i forgot the speed limit changed and i got my first and still only speeding ticket of my life 
 a week or so later i was back at work 
 a scruffy looking guy comes in most people would look at him and think this guy has to be on drugs or in a gang or at the minimum drive a motorcycle which is perfect because he was one of our regular customers and was a county drug task force sergeant and frequently made color copies of his crime scenes photos various cases 
 sergeant knew everyone who worked in the store and after waiting until he was the only person in the store pulled out a picture and asked if anyone recognized the man 
 my manager recognized old man '' from earlier and sent sergeant my way 
 sure enough it was old man 's mug shot 
 i fill sergeant in on the transaction and follow up and say i have n't seen him in a few weeks 
 well that 's because he 's in federal custody '' 
 sergeant asks me a few more questions about what was sent in the lost package and if we had done other business with him which we could n't recall doing and left it at that 
 a few days later i get a call from sergeant at home and he has a few more questions for me and asks if i can come up to work real quick 
 being the good citizen i am i obliged and was at work a few minutes later 
 instead of asking questions sergeant hands me a <unk> to testify in federal court ... 
 <unk> 
 he asks if i have any events coming up in the next few weeks that would take me out of town 
 the only thing on my schedule was our annual state youth drug and alcohol prevention conference that prom date and a few others from our local group were going to attend 
 sergeant says he or the prosecutor will be touch with <unk> on when i would be needed to testify 
 and that he would try and work around that conference 
 a few more days later and i get notified that the prosecutor had moved the schedule of witnesses around so i would be the first person on the stand in the trial that coming friday and i would be free to leave for the conference after that 
 so basically i get to testify in federal court miss the groups transportation to the conference which was several hours away and likely miss the opening speaker of the conference which just happened to be <unk> boss the us district attorney 
 the day of the trial comes and i 'm at the federal court house in the large city near where i live i 'm getting a little <unk> prep from sergeant going over the questions they will ask when he pulls out a standard fedex box full of meth 
 he had apparently been trying to use fedex drop boxes to send drugs around the country which was intercepted by a drug dog in a warehouse and the keys which were legitimately lost were to a car full of drugs in california that was part of some drug deal he was trying to do 
 so here i am 17 years old getting <unk> in to testify in a federal drug <unk> case the day i 'm supposed to be at a youth drug and alcohol prevention conference with the <unk> speaker being the district attorney that was overseeing the case 
 the first question ... on some date a now decades ago a man sent a set of keys with you while working at copy/ship place do you see that man today '' ... yes it was the man in the light blue suit sitting over there '' ... the rest of the <unk> went on he asked what was sent what happened to the package etc 
 it took about 5 minutes 
 the defense did n't even ask me any questions and i was free to go 
 as we leave the court room sergeant follows us out and thanks me for helping and he hopes i get to the conference on time 
 he ends with if there 's anything i can do for you let me know '' 
 i think for a second ... ca n't hurt to try ... i 've got this speeding ticket a few weeks ago ... '' sergeant <unk> and says he will see what he can do 
 i head off to the conference where i make it just in time to hear the opening speaker 
 he 's giving us some <unk> speech about how kids make all the difference blah blah blah and then it 's time for questions ... up i jump 
 mr. district attorney i had the <unk> of <unk> in one of your cases earlier this morning is it a growing trend for drug dealers to try and send drugs via the various shipping services '' 
 mr. district attorney chuckled and replied oh i heard about you thanks for your help on that glad you could make it down here on time blah blah blah drugs are bad blah blah blah law enforcement ... '' you may think this is where the story ends ... but now comes two somewhat are you kidding me moments '' a couple of days after the conference when i was due to either pay the speeding ticket or appear in court i got a call from sergeant 
 he said to head to court and it should be taken care of 
 so ... i do 
 they call my name and the judge asks how do i plea to the charge of speeding ... when the traffic court prosecutor speaks up excuse me your honor this is the case that sergeant has been <unk> on '' judge looks at me <unk> off a bunch of legal stuff ... faulty equipment ... court costs ... <unk> slam '' the look on the officers face that gave me the ticket was pretty awesome 
 a mix of wtf just happened '' and who the heck is this kid '' 
 i paid like $ 30 bucks and nothing on the record 
 it turns out that old man was convicted and sentenced to something like 30 years in jail 
 the last piece of this story <unk> a month or so later 
 i 'm back at work enjoying the end of summer and waiting for the start of my senior year when a lady walks in and needs to send a fax 
 i help her with a smile and when i look at the cover page for the fax number i see to : federal court of metro city name '' re : people <unk> old man '' notice of <unk> '' ... signed ... blank 
 as i 'm about to send the fax she asks me to stop and let her check something 
 i then witness her sign old man 's name ... i 'm thinking ... are you kidding me does she not know who i am ... that was the last i heard of old man nothing came of the forged signature i assume he 's still sitting in federal jail somewhere or maybe got out on good behavior 
 he seemed like a nice guy ... <unk> : cleaned up spelling from when i typed this in word pad corrected attorney general to district <unk> 'm standing outside on my break enjoying a smoke 
 a clueless lady cl walks up to me and asks if i have a spare 
 since i only bring enough with me to have at work it 's a great way to cut down i tell her no 
 she walks away and goes into the store 
 i finish my smoke and walk in as well 
 i walk past the counter say hi to one of my managers and go to clock back in 
 once i 've clocked in and returned i see cl standing at the counter and talking with my manager 
 cl : there he is 
 pointing at me cl : that 's your employee who was rude to me 
 my manager mm : ... and tell me again what it was he was rude about 
 cl : he would n't give me a smoke 
 cl : i demand that you tell him to give me a smoke 
 mm : i 'm sorry but his cigarettes are not the store 's property 
 it 's up to him to decide if he wants to or can give one out 
 cl : but he 's your employee and i 'm the customer 
 now tell him to give me a smoke 
 now 
 mm : actually as of right now you 're no longer our customer 
 please leave 
 after many dirty looks and all sorts of wonderful language cl finally leaves realising that she will not get what she wants 
 my manager and i exchange bewildered looks 
 mm : where the fuck do they crawl out of and why do they always come here 
 me : shall we go have a smoke 
 mm : yes 
 please i work as an assistant manager for a local chain of gas stations 
 the one i 'm at is probably one of the busiest stores in the state from february to september and the only one with two restrooms with multiple stalls instead of just a single <unk> one 
 not to mention we are pretty far from the nearest large city so no local police 
 i just got done inspecting our gas pumps and was sitting in the office busy calling in for maintenance a pump hose that started <unk> some nasty cracks 
 normal uninteresting gas station fair 
 in walks one of our cashiers my back turned to her and she says excuse me i just found this in the women 's restroom '' 
 i turn around and she is holding a loaded handgun 
 she hands it to me and i tell her to let me know if the owner comes back 
 i lock up the office engage the safety yay the safety was off 
 unload the handgun put it in one drawer then the magazine and the round that was in the chamber into another drawer away from the first one 
 i call the state troopers give them all the info thank god it was n't stolen and they say they will be by soon 
 trooper comes along picks up the handgun gets my info and leaves 
 about 5 minutes later i get a call from another trooper saying that they just pulled over a lady who was speeding on the way towards my store and let me know she is on the way to pick up her handgun 
 she arrives and gets extremely pissed off when i tell her that the troopers already collected it i give her their contact info and she leaves ... as a responsible <unk> owner myself the fact that she just left it laying around in the restroom pisses me off ignoring the fact it had a round in the chamber and the safety was off 
 i am just incredibly happy that an employee went in after her and not a child or thief 
 where i work there *really* needs to be a sign up telling people what is and is n't our job 
 i was working in a large fast food restaurant and it was a pretty slow day i was on drive thru handing out the food 
 being a slow day i walked up to the front to hang around the new girl 
 i wo n't lie she 's slow and i do n't like her very much 
 but if i work with people i try be as polite as can be 
 a woman with a baby walks in lays her baby on a table and beacons one of us to come over 
 <unk> you just change him while i find my car keys '' i tell her we 're not allowed to leave our positions ''i am the customer you do as i say '' i try to explain that we really ca n't do that ''well i 'm going to tell the manager '' and she starts cleaning him up on the table i 'm still explaining that there is a toilet to do that ''i do n't have to listen to you toilets are dirty and humiliating why would i change him in there '' 
 unfortunately for us the baby had taken a poop with the consistency of <unk> and his darling mother managed to get it on the table and it did n't smell fantastic 
 when she was finally done she looked the new girl in the eye and grinned ''i 'm not getting anything because you were so rude and i 'll be telling your manager how you refused to serve a new mother when she asked for *your* assistance '' i 'm not paid to clean children please do n't expect it of me 
 also she did call and my wet <unk> of a manager apologised and offered her a free meal 
 so this just happened a few days ago 
 i apologize for the wall of text but it 's <unk> for the story 
 i manage a shipping store that loves the color brown 
 we have 3 employees and we do the typical packaging and shipping that you would expect along with copies printing etc 
 as an additional source of revenue we have private <unk> to do fingerprinting for two different agencies that run background screenings 
 people in certain lines of work in our state medical child care education etc 
 are required by law to have these background screenings done before starting a new job and after every 5 years of employment 
 people are registered with one of these two agencies make payment to them and are then sent to us with a registration number form to have their fingerprints collected 
 we collect the fingerprints <unk> on equipment provided to us by the agencies and they are then electronically submitted to the background check agencies who in turn send them to the fbi and our state law enforcement agency for processing 
 we then sign off on their registration number form and tell them to hold onto it in case there are any problems 
 i should also mention that these screenings are quite expensive to register for but we are only paid a small commission by the agencies for each person we fingerprint 
 we are also the only place in the area to have this done for these agencies 
 no we do a lot of fingerprinting here easily 20-30 people a day between the two agencies and it can get quite the <unk> to handling of other business in the store when you’ve only got 3 people working 
 we have lots of strict guidelines that we are required to <unk> by for fingerprinting so before we start we simply give folks a <unk> of what we are going to do and what we need them to do to get them finished as quickly as possible 
 most people cooperate some do not 
 some are just downright rude about it 
 if someone isn’t <unk> with what we need them to do keeping relaxed not trying to roll their fingers themselves etc 
 we will ask them again a few times to cooperate 
 if they are rude about it or still don’t cooperate then we just do what we need to do to get them finished and out the door 
 if you 're fingerprints are <unk> or damaged or if you were just uncooperative and didn’t allow us to get clear prints the prints can be rejected by the fbi or state law enforcement agency as <unk> 
 if this happens they send you a rejection number and then you have to come back with that and your original registration number and get them done all over again 
 this is where our story begins 
 i am at the counter helping customers when this woman walks in 
 you know those people who you can just look at and instantly tell that they are going to have a bad attitude 
 this was one of them so we’ll just <unk> her bad attitude ba 
 me – “hello how are you today ” ba – <unk> <unk> random paper at me me - <unk> paper see scribbled number on paper “okay let’s see what we’ve got here 
 ah it looks like you need to be fingerprinted <unk> ba – *in extremely condescending tone “uh <unk> me – “okay do you have your original registration <unk> ba – *sigh <unk> tone “no why don’t you just look it <unk> me - “i’m sorry but i don’t have any way to do that 
 i don’t have access to the agencies systems to search for your information 
 we simply enter your registration number to pull up your <unk> ba – <unk> i don’t care just do it” me – “i won’t be able to do anything without your registration <unk> ba - <unk> paper from me <unk> is f*cking ridiculous 
 ” me – “okay well that was <unk> ba – starts stomping <unk> people <unk> just done your f*cking job 
 ” i’ve had it with this lady at this point me – “alright then you have a lovely <unk> ba – <unk> 
 you too asshole 
 ” at this point she walks out the door 
 mind you this all happened in front of other customers 
 i apologize to them for her language 
 one of my associates m begins telling me that he was the one that fingerprinted her originally 
 he tells me that she was very uncooperative and was just as rude when he had dealt with her 
 i then tell m and my other associate d that if she comes back in to let me handle it 
 i plan on refusing her service and asking her not to return to the store 
 i am just finishing up with a customer when m motions toward the door 
 ba is coming back in and she’s talking to someone on the phone 
 she walks up to the counter and thrusts her phone at me 
 i know what’s going on here 
 bad move lady 
 ba – <unk> talk to <unk> *starts muttering about how stupid we are me – “hello this is <unk> i’m the store <unk> phone – “hello this is <unk> 
 i’m the hr director for blabiddy blah health care center 
 i understand that there’s a problem with ba’s fingerprinting what information did you <unk> me – “well we needed to have her registration id to collect her finger prints again but at this point i’m not going to be able to complete this for <unk> phone – “what is the issue ” ba is standing directly across the counter from me with a slightly puzzled look on her face 
 i look her dead in the eyes as i continue <unk> me – <unk> she came in earlier and i asked her for the information i needed she became very rude and combative telling me that my request was ‘effing <unk> and that we <unk> done our effing <unk> before calling me an <unk> from across the store on her way out 
 this was all done in front of several customers in my store 
 we do not tolerate this kind of behavior and i will not allow her back into this store.” a look of horror and plain old “oh <unk> <unk> flashes across ba’s face 
 ba – “well you started it ” i give her a look that just says <unk> <unk> 
 phone – “oh my god i am so sorry 
 i apologize for this 
 i completely understand 
 please know that we will definitely handle this and she will not be back in your store 
 could you please put ba back on the phone 
 again i am so sorry for this.” ba is standing there mouth <unk> looking like someone just ran over her puppy 
 i hand her phone back and say “she wants to talk to you you can leave my store <unk> she turns to walk out and puts the phone back to her ear 
 i’m listening with delight as she walks out 
 ba – <unk> <unk> he <unk> i can’t….no wait <unk> 
 hello ” she glares back at me 
 i just wave and say <unk> ” haven’t seen her since 
 **tl dr horrible lady berates me and calls me an <unk> job for you 
 ** so there 's pretty strict laws about liquor store operations where i am the one in question here was the fact that a liquor store has to sell liquor in sealed containers ie you cant open an <unk> <unk> and customers are not allowed to open or consume liquor on premises 
 i ran a <unk> this was a small country town and the two <unk> would help each other out and keep each other in the <unk> about problem customers etc 
 one day i got a call from the other shop about a group of tourists who got all offensive when they were told they could n't open or consume on premises <unk> their right to have their own liquor etc 
 they stormed out without taking their goods 
 they came into my store being nice i said i would give them their products that they paid for at the other shop and sort out the stock transfer with them later as long as they did n't open or consume it on premises 
 they were pissed that i knew that they had left stuff behind and what have you but went and grabbed their stuff one of them on the way out stopped at the door turned to me opened a can took a sip being quite the <unk> and walked out 
 queue the cop a local that was walking into the store he saw a little bit came in and asked what was up 
 i explained it to him he excused himself and left the store 
 10 minutes later i hear screaming from the carpark 
 the police officer had given a ticket to the guys for a bunch of things but the big one was effectively driving while drinking just pulling out of carpark 
 the guys stormed off on foot 
 brilliant i thought perfect <unk> from the local cop had a smile on my face the rest of the day rang the other shop and we were cracking up laughing 
 i leave at the end of my shift and the cop is sitting there next to the car i went over to say thanks and the cop tells me in what i think was the most brilliant move ever that he rang the rental company who instantly terminated the rental agreement and were sending someone to pick up the vehicle 
 apparently it stuffed their whole six week itinerary there was n't anywhere to rent a vehicle for close to a days solid driving ... customer comes in asking help for a certain problem 
 my conversation yesterday went like this : <unk> l me= me obviously lady : my grill is not working do you know whats wrong 
 after looking at it i noticed the ignition was broken off so she couldnt <unk> it 
 me : yes ma'am the <unk> is broken and needs to be replaced 
 we sell <unk> ones for cheap 
 lady : of no thats not right my friend told me i just needed some more propane 
 me : why did you bring the entire grill in here if you just needed propane 
 lady : can you help me or not 
 or do you now know anything about grills 
 i just sold her a new propane tank and helped her load the grill back in her truck 
 she will be back and blame me tomorrow probably about selling her the wrong thing 
 this happens all the time people ask for help i give them an answer and than they just ignore my answer and insult me that i dont know anything 
 original story : so i 'm an impatient bastard so i decided to not wait for a reply to my email to corporate and instead called their corporate hotline 
 i was connected to the district manager for <unk> and i told my tale of <unk> to her 
 when i was done she admitted that while it was legal to accept state ids ... dm : however it is against our store policy to accept them for alcohol purchases 
 me : can you explain why 
 dm : there are so many different state ids out there that it 's impossible to train our employees on what they look like so we keep it simple and just do n't accept any 
 me : but you accept out of state driver 's licenses 
 dm : oh yes we accept those 
 me : would n't your argument about the number of different state ids also apply to driver 's licenses 
 how can you deny state ids for that reason but accept driver 's licenses 
 dm : it 's just our policy 
 that 's when i decided to bring up an issue that people had mentioned in the original thread 
 me : are n't you worried about violating the americans with disabilities act 
 dm : how so 
 me : well lots of disabled people do n't drive and have state ids instead 
 is it your grocery store 's official policy that disabled people are n't allowed to buy alcohol there 
 dm : um ... can i call you back 
 so she calls back 20 minutes later and surprise 
 it turns out that she was <unk> and that state ids can in fact be used to buy alcohol at their stores 
 she promises to personally call the general manager of the store i went to and make sure that he <unk> his employees on alcohol sales protocol 
 she also promised to find out what manager was working that shift and make sure they get a talking to about the proper way to deal with a guest who has an issue 
 all in all i 'm satisfied and kind of amused by this whole situation 
 i did n't want people fired i just wanted their obviously incorrect actions corrected 
 though being a petty bastard every time i go into that location to buy booze in the future i 'm going to look for that particular manager and if she 's there ask her if she can ring up my 12 pack of beer for me - when i was in college i was the night manager at a fast food place near campus that stayed open until 3am 
 after we closed we had a half hour to clean the store and leave 
 my boss said if we could not get the store cleaned in that half-hour i could do one of two things 
 i could have everyone clock out and finish cleaning the store or i could call him and explain why we could n't get the store clean in a half hour and maybe just maybe he would let us all stay clocked in to finish 
 the minute he told me this i thought to myself this is b.s 
 one night we got a rush at <unk> 
 apparently there had been a <unk> party and at least 50 people poured into the lobby to order tacos 
 it was just me and one other person on duty because that <unk> was usually very slow 
 we managed to clear everyone out by <unk> we did $ 300 worth of 39 cent tacos in that 40 minutes 
 after everyone was gone i looked around and realized we were past our <unk> for clocking out 
 now i 'm not going to even ask someone to clock out and work for free 
 it 's not in my nature 
 so ... i called my boss 
 yep 
 i woke him up 
 after he screamed at me for not calling him when the rush started so he could come and help he lived 30 minutes away he yelled at me some more 
 i simply asked him if he wanted us to stay clocked in and clean the store or if he wanted us to clock out and go home 
 he chose the former 
 edit : for those of you <unk> of math the 39 cent taco was an example of how cheap the food was 
 people ordered drinks and other food items too mostly burritos but also <unk> work in a neighborhood children 's store 
 we sell toys and books and most of our customers are grandparents people buying birthday gifts or both 
 yesterday a grandpa came in to shop for his grandson 
 grandpa : i need something for my 5 year old grandson '' 
 me : great 
 are you looking for a toy maybe something to build 
 or we could do a book does he still like picture books '' 
 grandpa : a book would be nice he likes to read '' 
 so i suggest a few books to him and we finally settle on the wonderful and hilarious * this <unk> belongs to me you should all read it 
 me : would you like this <unk> today 
 is this a birthday present or a 'just because gift '' 
 at this the grandpa paused 
 normally this is a pretty easy question but i could tell he was trying to figure out what to say 
 i try not to pry about what people are buying but i did want to know what kind of paper to use 
 grandpa : well it 's kind of a long story '' 
 i ring him up and start wrapping the book and then he explains why he 's buying the gift 
 grandpa : my grandson has a favorite stuffed dog he takes everywhere 
 a few months ago he asked his mother when dog was born 
 she picked a date out of the air and thought nothing of it 
 a week ago he piped up and said <unk> dog 's birthday is coming up 
 march 29 '' 
 me : starting to laugh 
 this is a gift for his stuffed dog '' 
 grandpa : yup 
 we 're having a birthday party tomorrow with pizza and ice cream and everything 
 and i figured you ca n't have a birthday party without a gift 
 and a book is a nice gift he can read it to dog '' 
 i finished up wrapping and sent him on his way 
 i have to say after 2.5 years working here this was the first time i 've ever wrapped a gift for a stuffed animal 
 i found the whole thing absolutely charming i hope you did too 
 happy birthday dog 
 edit : i did not expect this story to get so popular 
 thank you everyone for your kind comments 
 while i 've had plenty of experiences with bad customers it 's moments like these that make me happy to be a bookseller 
 hello 
 i apologize in advance for formatting <unk> and spelling errors 
 i 'm on my phone 
 so i 'm in my early 20 's and work part time retail at a beauty supply store to <unk> my disability income 
 i just went through a 9 month long battle with a very aggressive form of <unk> which for any who are n't familiar with it is a blood cancer in 2013 including daily <unk> of arsenic and <unk> and even though there isnt a <unk> it can be controlled with <unk> <unk> now that i 'm past the first year but i will be <unk> and immune <unk> for many years if not the rest of my life and will probably have to be on these medicines for the rest of my life as well 
 earlier today i had a lady come in and just by the look of her and how she acted you could tell she was going to be self entitled and some what rude at best 
 she was overly tan with bleach blonde hair super long bright pink <unk> channel bag and drove a mercedes 
 she goes directly for our selection of hair extensions and browses for a few minutes she was talking loudly on her cellphone the whole time and didnt even acknowledge my greeting as she entered the store she then starts snapping her fingers at me to get my attention 
 snapping her fingers like i 'm a dog 
 i guess she couldnt be bothered to tear herself away from her riveting conversation about why her friends coworkers boyfriend was having lunch with another woman to speak to me like a human 
 i walk over to her and politely ask what she needs help with 
 she wants me to unlock all of our hair so she can browse as she liked we keep it locked because a lot of it is over $ 100 and is a high theft item i told her i wasnt allowed to do that but if there was any color that she wanted to look at i would be happy to unlock it for her and we also have a ring of full length swatches she is welcome to look at 
 she starts huffing and giving me dirty looks how dare i tell her no as per our company policy do n't i know who her husband is 
 eventually she <unk> on one of our <unk> sets of 100 % human hair clip ins 
 before i ring her up i let her know that all of our hair is absolutely not <unk> or <unk> for any reason once she walks out the door 
 she says fine and i ring her up and tell her the final price plus tax close to $ 200 she goes ballistic 
 but my daughter may have cancer so i should get a discount '' 
 so your buying extensions for your daughter because she may have cancer '' 
 no they 're for me but its very stressful having a sick child and the cancer will be very expensive to treat if she has it '' 
 ... ... <unk> 
 ma'am i 'm very aware of how expensive cancer is but we dont offer illness discounts '' 
 if you had ever had a loved one with cancer you 'd understand '' i 'm a really easy going person and usually let things like this not effect me in the slightest hell i love making cancer jokes but i hate it when people use other peoples <unk> to gain sympathy and benefit 
 my mother had a really tough time dealing with my illness so i l know how <unk> <unk> it can be to have a sick child 
 i have cancer ma'am so i know what its like and how devastating this type of illness can be on the body and mind 
 all four of my grand parents died of cancer and my step mother is <unk> breast cancer for the 3rd time and it has metastasized to her lungs <unk> <unk> and brain and they 're giving her less than 2 years so yes i know how it feels 
 if i were to give a cancer discount it would be to the people fighting it not people trying to gain my <unk> ... '' <unk> and stunned look from <unk> ... ... ... your total is $ 200 would you like a bag '' 
 she was very sweet for the 2 minutes it took her to pay and leave 
 tl : dr my kid might have cancer so discounts on items to make myself look good through my grieving period maybe 
 i worked at a few grocery stores and convenient stores during and right after high school 
 i was never cut out for these jobs 
 i get extremely upset with myself if i let someone walk all over me and i do n't retaliate 
 i replay the incident over and over in my head and <unk> over it 
 so i would retaliate often and get myself into trouble 
 i remember this one time when a redneck walks into the convenient store tosses a wadded 20 dollar bill onto the counter and barks at me marlboro <unk> '' 
 oh boy here we go 
 i was about to be a jerk back and <unk> are usually ready for a fight 
 i took the twenty and began slowly unwadding it while staring directly into redneck 's beady little eyes with a straight face 
 once i had the bill unfolded i placed it neatly into the till and gathered up his change 
 however before handing it back to him i wadded up the bills and then dropped the wad and the change onto the counter 
 my adrenaline was kicking in full force in <unk> of the confrontation that was <unk> 
 to redneck 's credit he proved me wrong 
 he just chuckled and said i see what you did there '' 
 then scooped up his changed and stuffed it into his pocket 
 i wished him a nice day and he thanked me 
 sometimes people just are n't thinking and genuinely do n't <unk> to be rude 
 i do n't mind this as long as they are reasonable human beings who recognize and acknowledge their rudeness after it is pointed out to <unk> this did n't actually happen to me but to a coworker 
 i work for an attraction in a tourist town that hires high schoolers for summer jobs 
 a couple of days ago we had a group of elderly men and women come in to play our <unk> golf course 
 now this day we had one of the high schoolers running the register 
 we shall call her mouse because she 's normally very quiet at least when dealing with customers 
 the first old man walks up to the counter and very quickly says one for <unk> '' 
 mouse says okay sir that will be 11.99 '' 
 old man replies with what about the senior discount '' 
 now we do n't have a senior discount but if you 're nice we will normally give the local discount 50 percent off 
 mouse says i 'm sorry sir we do n't have a senior discount but i can- '' at this point the old man loudly interrupts with well what kind of s*** is that 
 do n't you support seniors '' 
 now you should understand that our <unk> is families with young children 
 so there are kids everywhere 
 he stares at mouse with a smirk on his face 
 what followed surprised me 
 mouse looked him straight in the eye thank god for the <unk> cash wrap because she 's like five feet tall and otherwise would have had to <unk> her neck to do it 
 and says that will be 11.99 '' 
 he starts in again she interrupts with that will be 11.99 '' 
 every time he opens his mouth she just says that will be 11.99 '' 
 the look of utter defeat as he handed his money over was very satisfying 
 tl dr old man tries to intimidate a 16 year old girl by yelling and cursing at her 16 year old girl do n't give a fuck old man puts tail between <unk> operations manager was on vacation this past week and no one picked up her slack 
 cue her return on sunday and the safe empty of anything smaller than a $ 20 
 ca n't go to the back so we had to be creative 
 it 's against policy but i ran out of fucks to give ages ago and made a hand written sign that said we need ones 
 please 
 thank you '' 
 and posted it on the side of my register 
 most anyone who puts their stuff down would be able to see it 
 some donated their excess garage sale cash while others ignored it and insisted on paying exact coin change so they 'll get an extra dollar back 
 it all balanced out in the end so who cares 
 a young family comes up daughter in the cart dad at the pinpad and mom unloading the groceries 
 the daughter is a small kid i ca n't judge ages very well but maybe 4 or so 
 she looks up at me and says & gt kid : why do you need ones 
 & gt me : because we ran out 
 i 'm kind of awkward around kids i 've had too many parents get upset with talking to their child in the past so i always keep it short and sweet without being <unk> or condescending 
 i keep ringing up their order and notice a strange tension between the parents all of a sudden 
 i start to worry that i may have <unk> my answer inappropriately somehow and ring faster to make up for whatever <unk> i might have caused 
 the mom suddenly stops and looks at her daughter & gt mom : you can read 
 the dad stops too and looks back and i stop ringing so he wo n't have to worry about price watching 
 & gt mom : she just read that sign and asked her about it 
 it 's not even the number one it 's spelled out 
 & gt dad : you can read 
 what 's this word 
 & gt kid : we keeps pronouncing it wrong but how kids say words wrong sometimes 
 the dad gives up and goes back to looking at the screen while the mom insists that she 's saying we '' 
 it was just such an adorable moment and the girl looked so <unk> with all the attention she was getting 
 she had this expression kind of like yeah of course i can read duh '' while her mom and dad were each giddy and ecstatic 
 it just made my day to see a happy family celebrate a <unk> 
 i had to share 
 the other day while working two middle school boys walked into the store 
 we are very close to the middle school so lots of students come down after school for candy 
 i happened to know one of the kids as his mother coached girls <unk> with my dad many many years ago 
 although i do not think he recognized me at all 
 they bought two boxes of candy and their total was $ <unk> so their change was $ <unk> 
 the kid i knew told me to keep the $ <unk> and just to give him the $ 16 
 i finished up the transaction and thought nothing of it 
 about an hour later i see the two kids respond with the mother who i know 
 she immediately recognized me but that did n't seem to change her attitude 
 & gt he said he only got $ 11 back instead of $ 16 '' 
 i thought back on the transaction and distinctly remember pulling out 3 $ 5 's 
 i told her this but she did n't believe me and asked if we could check the drawer 
 luckily the manager was walking by and i had he quickly count the drawer 
 drawer came out perfect 
 goddamn kid took one of the 5 's and pocketed it thinking his mother would n't find out.i ca n't believe that i have n't thought to share this yet 
 <unk> : at my university we have a grocery store type thing where students can buy things like milk and eggs with their meal plan 
 it also was a pizza place that <unk> any kitchen food and beverages 
 it was pretty common that people would think we delivered anything from the store and disappointed to find we did not 
 i was a cashier and i took deliver orders 
 **the <unk> me and <unk> boy hb <unk> <unk> & gt me : thank you for calling campus pizza store my name is linzdarling how can i help you 
 & gt hb : yeah i need to place a delivery order & gt me : alright what can we get for you today 
 & gt hb : i need a large pepperoni pizza and a box of condoms 
 & gt me : um unfortunately we can only deliver kitchen items and beverages 
 would you still like to order a pizza 
 & gt hb : but i 'm naked already 
 & gt me : were you going to answer the door naked when your pizza arrived 
 - <unk> he hung up on me 
 to this day that is my favorite delivery order 
 this just happened 
 i 'm working in drive thru on a slow sunday afternoon 
 lady orders a coke and pulls around 
 she hands me her debit card and i hand her the coke 
 & gt lady : i do n't need my receipt 
 & gt me : alright 
 we stare at each other for a moment 
 & gt lady : yeah i do n't need it 
 * waves hand around * & gt me : okay okay 
 we stare for another moment 
 & gt lady : well can i have my card back please 
 & gt me : just a moment ... just then the card transaction finishes processing and comes back with insufficient funds 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but this card is declined 
 do you have another one 
 & gt lady : angrily no ... & gt me : well i can give you the card back if you hand me that coke again 
 she begrudgingly gives up the coke and i return the card 
 i offer her a water instead but she drives off 
 usually i 'm happy to give away free soft drinks for various reasons 
 but not like that long time lurker yada yada 
 a friend of mine runs a local supermarket 
 i was there picking up some stuff for the weekend when the manager friend mf gets paged to a checkout 
 i follow him as he was giving me a discount damaged goods he held on to them for me loud man lm was <unk> poor trainee pt over something mf : : excuse me sir what appears to be the problem '' 
 lm shouting : this f***ing idiot wont give me a discount '' here we go 
 mf : i 'm sorry sir what discount was that '' 
 lm this $ 500 item is marked at $ 4.50 and she 's not giving me it for that price '' mf : well i 'm sorry sir but that must be a mistake 
 that item only goes down to $ 400 even on our biggest sale 3 months beforehand i would say that this was a <unk> and should be $ <unk> dollars 
 i am happy to give it to you for this price '' 
 lm : no you have to give it to me for the price on the sticker '' mf and i look at the box only to see 
 a competitor 's sticker on it with <unk> saying $ 4.50 mf : i 'm sorry sir this is n't one of our stickers let alone for the price you are saying '' 
 lm : you have to give it to me for that price the law says so 
 this goes on for about 5 minutes when suddenly mf grabs a passing team member 's sticker gun he was fixing up prices at the time and <unk> with it then puts the new sticker on the item not for sale '' lm : what 
 not for sale 
 what is that supposed to mean 
 mf : it means 
 that i have to follow the sticker 
 the law says so '' 
 lm stands there jaw dropped for a good 20 seconds then just walks off without the rest of his cart 
 tl dr fake sticker = super cheap 
 new sticker = no sale + 1 angry scammer.soooo i work at a pet store 
 this happened maybe five minutes before i got to work last night 
 obviously we sell lots of animals 
 including reptiles 
 and spiders 
 from what i heard we had a woman come in yesterday that wanted to buy the one small <unk> we had 
 so the one person working that is n't afraid of spiders come on they 're creepy gets it all packaged up in an empty betta cup and hands it to her to go cash out 
 the reptile tanks are pretty much 30 steps from the registers 
 so the woman walks by the dog beds then starts to walk out of the store 
 the cashier asked her what was going on with the spider she decided she did n't want it and walked out 
 cue my manager freaking out because she 's terrified of spiders 
 they found the little guy thankfully still in his betta cup shoved between two dog beds 
 moral of the story 
 if you do n't want an animal tell someone 
 do n't hide it in the store 
 i just do n't even know anymore 
 edit : typo cause i suck 
 edit 2 : we sold the <unk> to one of my coworkers so he can live a happy life now 
 <unk> we have a lot of religious crazies on our town 
 one guy loves to sit on the street corner screaming at anyone who walks by that they 're gon na burn or screaming words like whore '' or slut '' to any woman that walks by until the cops come and chase him off 
 another one just hangs around using religion to threaten people for things he wants i.e 
 money or cigarettes 
 him : hey can i bum a cigarette and a dollar '' 
 shop owner : i do n't smoke and i dont have a dollar 
 you also ca n't sit in front of my store doing this '' 
 him : fuck you 
 you 're gon na burn you son of a bitch 
 the judgement is coming for you and you 're gon na burn '' 
 every now and then however one of them comes into my shop 
 i was running the store one sunday and i had just opened when a family walks in with their three kids 
 i open with the pleasantries : hey guys 
 hows it going 
 ya 'll wan na see some magic we just got in '' 
 the kids light up 
 they 're excited 
 then dad steps in ... dad : no 
 we would not like to see any magic 
 because we all know that magic is the tool of the devil and those that practice the dark arts will burn forever in the <unk> <unk> of hell come judgement day '' 
 he made sure to scream it loud enough so people outside of the shop could hear him ranting 
 after looking at him in dead silence for a moment i turned around ignoring him and went right into showing his kids magic until he dragged them out of the store because he was n't getting enough attention 
 a more recent incident happened just last week 
 a mother comes in with two kids and she 's talking to them as they walk in 
 mom : you wan na see a magic show 
 maybe they 'll show us a magic show 
 would n't a magic show be so much fun '' 
 i show them a good 30-45 minutes of magic but the moment i mention the prices of the various tricks we have she interrupts me 
 mom : oh no no no 
 we do n't want to buy any magic 
 magic is the tool of <unk> and i do n't want my children being <unk> 
 thank you for the show '' 
 this happens so much that it 's become the running joke of the shop that every trick we sell comes with a free slayer cd and sacrificial <unk> starter kit 
 <unk> i 'm not a huge fan of coupons in general 
 there is usually some problem with them like they are either expired they do n't scan or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up which is a pet peeve of mine 
 if you want to use one or two coupons i am fine with that 
 i completely understand wanting to save some money 
 but there is a trend that pisses me off to no end 
 couponers '' 
 a lady came in a while back with a large amount of deodorant in her basket 
 after i finished ringing her up she said oh and i have a few coupons ... '' she then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse 
 none of them having scannable bar codes meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually 
 i called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as i am supposed to 
 she notices i am reading them and says yeah 
 those should pay for the entire transaction '' 
 i 'm sorry it says limit one coupon per customer and that they are n't to be used with any other coupons '' 
 i reply 
 no 
 i did the math 
 i have enough here to cover the entire transaction 
 in fact you guys should technically be giving *me* cash back '' 
 she says with a chuckle 
 at this point the line was piling up again on my register so i called up a third cashier and the manager 
 the manager comes up and asks how he can help 
 she says yeah this guy wo n't let me use my coupons '' 
 i point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons ca n't be used like this 
 the manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so <unk> for free 
 before she left you could just feel the <unk> radiating off of her 
 she says you should be expecting more of us 
 we couponers are starting to get pretty big around here 
 next time just scan the damn coupons '' she then struts out the door with a smile 
 the manager was fired soon after 
 had this type of customer come in yesterday 
 i work at a. hardware store where we sell wood obviously 
 we keep wood on the floor for customers to buy and than the <unk> stacked behind it in pretty high stacks bundled together 
 sometimes we get very annoying difficult customers who think the stack of 300 peices of wood on the floor are not good enough and want us to cut the wood in the back 
 we can not do this for a multitude of reasons but the main is safety 
 here is the conversation that followed 
 me= me 
 <unk> angry guy me : sorry sir 
 we ca n't cut that bundle because the lumber will fall and it becomes a safety issue 
 also we have no place to put it once we open it since it ca n't go back up 
 ag : i do n't care all of the wood down here is bad me : have you looked through it 
 i do n't think you could have looked through all of that in five minutes 
 ag : i do n't care i want that wood 
 points at bundles in the back 
 if you are n't gon na do it i can get the manager to make you do it for me 
 at this point i walked away and went to talk to my manager about the proper procedure 
 he told me to go back and explain to him exactly what i said before 
 when i came back however he was climbing on top of the wood cutting the bundle himself 
 keep in mind this is about 15 feet high 
 we had to ban him from the store for safety concerns over customers safety 
 some people just like being <unk> to know : i work as a deli assistant at a popular grocery store in my state 
 in my store we have <unk> <unk> etc 
 in the cabinet which makes up the majority of orders although we do slice on order for customers who ask 
 now onto the story : i was working the easter saturday <unk> in australia big supermarkets are usually closed easter friday open saturday and closed easter sunday and monday been up since <unk> slicing ham prepping the cabinet cleaning all the fun stuff 
 it gets to 1pm and i am all but done i was supposed to be sent home a few hours back but it 's very busy so i 've stayed on 
 a customer asks me for one of our more popular hams 200g i pick up his ham put it on the scale and it 's 200g exactly on the scale 
 unfortunately due to the paper weight the tare brings it down to <unk> but the customer is <unk> impressed 
 the customer next asks for 300g of danish feta of which ours are in <unk> sized blocks 
 i grab a block and put it on the scale it <unk> over <unk> so my lessons in fractions of primary school comes back strongly 
 i cut the feta with the paper tare on and boom 300g exactly 
 the customer now looks upon me with <unk> <unk> and sleepy me is soaking it all up 
 dear employer i have <unk> <unk> customer service level please increase pay above minimum wage 
 thank <unk> was out of country now before i left country i had interviews a very smart intelligent young lady 
 i had every intention on hiring her and training her when i returned from my vacation 
 however due to an employee getting into a car accident and being <unk> i was forced to hire her and have her start without me from 9 <unk> away 
 it was only going be 4 days ... which should be fairly slow 
 however because of this and the nature of the job she could only greet <unk> <unk> be nice 
 so i <unk> to do exactly this i also told her to explain the situation the employee who was supposed to work today is in the hospital unfortunately i am not trained to handle your problem i however am more then happy to take notes collect contact details and on this date my manager will call you to take care of you we apologize for the circumstances '' she had 5 customers in that 4 day time frame she took notes and did as she was asked ... but one customer she mentioned was incredibly rude 
 called her stupid said she was lazy etc 
 whatever shit happens i still want his business maybe he was just having a bad day 
 well that customer comes in and i begin handling his situation keep in mind besides a few minutes of wasted time ... this situation did n't cost him anything 
 well of course my employee is in the office as i do on the job training 
 he <unk> resorts to insulting my employee i ask if he was explained the situation ... on why she was unable to help him ... he said that does n't matter ... she should know better how complicated could this shit be 
 she 's an idiot for not figuring it out '' at which point i had enough i grabbed our brochures from him cleared my desk looked at my employee who was standing and said please have a seat '' room is silent ... customer is looking at me with a strange look on his face when i start look sir here is the deal i normally have two employees work for me ... this is what the market will bear 
 one employee just joined the military and the other one was in a car accident meaning i had no one left to keep the office open and take notes 
 i hired this young lady from 9 time <unk> away ... in another country and she had interactions with 5 customers to include you 
 out of those 5 only one said he had a negative experience and the other 4 understood the unfortunate circumstances which lead to those 4 days of having an untrained employee behind this desk 
 now because a mistake in this business could cost both myself and you a large sum of money i instructed her to only take notes and advise the customer i will work with them as soon as i get back 
 now i can understand that you might be frustrated with the current situation and i apologize for that ... that however gives you no right to call this talented intelligent young lady a moron do we understand each other '' 
 he responded with well you should have had a trained employee ready '' i fired back well hindsight is 20/20 and i could n't predict a car crash 
 i apologize for that 
 now what gives you the right to insult my employee '' 
 he is quiet sir are you married 
 he goes yes '' i go how would you wife feel if she saw how you acted both the day of the incident and today '' 
 he 's twiddling his thumbs do you understand the situation better now '' 
 he responds yes '' great ... now with that in mind do you feel that it was appropriate to insult this young lady intelligence and make her visibly upset 
 is that something your ok with 
 cause i 'll tell you what ... i 'm not ok with it '' he agreed ... quite shock actually sir i feel it 'd be an appropriate time to apologize for how you treated this young lady ... would you agree '' he agreed i then asked him to apologize to her 
 which he did he was actually quite sincere about it 
 i turned to her and said do you accept his apology '' with the biggest shit eating grin on her face she accepted of course <unk> where high so i said sir you 've proven yourself to the bigger man 
 i thank you very much for your apology ... i suggest before we move on we have a cup of coffee 
 how does that sound '' 
 he agreed i brewed up a couple cups of coffee and we all calmed down got to know each other personally ... and he became my best client ever 
 also the employee in question is still loyal and <unk> to me to this day 
 after he left she was shocked she never seen a manager stand up to a customer like that before 
 especially in an industry where we only see a dozen or so clients a month 
 i personally at my business i put employees needs ahead of the customer 
 i feel creating more satisfied employees creates a better environment <unk> customer service.i work at a grocery store near <unk> 
 for those of you unaware it snowed here recently 
 a lot 
 the parking lot is mostly <unk> but the cart corrals are still filled up with snow so a lot of people have been just leaving their carts outside the corrals waiting to get hit by a car 
 so i 'm doing carts last night and some lady comes up to the other end of the corral i 'm at and asks is it okay if i just leave this here '' 
 while starting to put her cart next to the corral 
 normally i would n't tell a customer that i 'd prefer them to put their cart back inside but since she asked i assumed she actually cared where i wanted her to put it 
 i say actually can you put it back in the store '' 
 & gt lady : you 're kidding right 
 & gt me : no ... the corrals are filled in with snow ... carts slide around cars get damaged it 's just a big mess 
 & gt lady : so you want it back in the store 
 & gt me : yeah ... & gt lady : that 's crazy 
 and she walks away with her cart in a huff 
 i see her go up to another customer and yell he wants us to put the carts back in the store 
 can you believe that '' 
 as i 'm bringing in a line of carts i pass her coming out the entrance 
 i see that after all that she did put her cart away so i say thanks '' and she just looks away with a scowl on her face 
 sorry lady 
 being asked to clean up after yourself like an adult can be tough i guess 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 **story : ** welcome to the week of scam artists 
 they rarely get away with it but that sure does n't stop them from trying 
 everything we sell is buy 1 get 1 free bogo 
 we also send out <unk> and have business cards that are good for buy 1 get 2 free on any item up to $ 50 
 we also let you mix and match the items so you don’t have to get three of the same things 
 i 'm basically giving you an extra $ 25 in free fireworks just for showing up in the hopes that you purchase more than that and that you come back to see us every year 
 the coupons have your typical legalese at the bottom 
 can only be used on one item can not be reproduced one offer per day one offer per family our group only valid on items up to $ 50 etc 
 i usually keep a stack of these coupons in my pocket and i hand them out pretty freely when the store is open 
 i think it 's a great promotional tool and although it does impact my bottom line i would n't think of getting rid of it 
 as you can imagine we get our fair share of people trying to scam us with the coupon 
 **scam 1** there 's a lady and her husband that show up at our tent at least four or five times each season with coupons 
 each time it 's the same routine 
 they 'll spend an hour watching videos and carefully examining everything we sell 
 when they’re ready to checkout the husband and wife will both approach the counter separately each carrying their three items and each with and a coupon 
 they each pay for one item and get the other two for free 
 if we ask them if there together which i 've done before for laughs they shake their heads and act like they’ve never met even though they just spent the last hour shopping together 
 the very next day <unk> show up and do the exact same thing 
 another hour of examining products pick out three walk to the counter separately use their coupon 
 even though they are technically scamming me i always let it go because frankly i think it 's funny as hell 
 **scam 2** another regular customer 
 every season this guy comes in and picks out three of every item he <unk> to purchase 
 when he gets to the counter he presents his coupon and we of course explained to him that he can only use it on one item 
 he 'll then spend 5 minutes arguing that i let him use it on everything he purchased the last time he was here 
 in the end i’ll let him use it on two items and he <unk> like he’s won the lottery 
 the thing is he’s a regular and he buys a <unk> of fireworks 
 i’d probably give him a better discount than the two uses of the card if we didn’t have to go back and put up all the extra shit he picked out 
 i seriously think he does it just to feel like he’s gotten something over on us 
 **scam 3** a lady walks up to the counter with a fountain $ 19.95 and two massive <unk> $ <unk> in her cart 
 i was standing behind the counter so i went to ring her up 
 before i could start she handed me a coupon and this conversation took place 
 **lady : ** i’m just paying for the fountain i’m going to use the coupon for the free items 
 **me : ** wondering wtf she is thinking i’m sorry but the coupon is only good on items up to $ 50 and the free items have to be of equal or <unk> value 
 **lady : ** it doesn’t say that anywhere on the coupon 
 i look at the coupon and sure as hell she’s <unk> she’s cut off the bottom third of the coupon that had all the legalese 
 **me : ** i’m sorry but this coupon has been altered 
 it normally has all the details on the bottom handing her another coupon from my pocket so she can see 
 **lady : ** that’s not my problem 
 my coupon doesn’t say that so legally you have to honor my purchase 
 **me : ** rudely because wtf really 
 yeah that’s not going to happen 
 i don’t know what happened to your coupon sure i don’t but it’s been altered and i’m not obligated to take altered coupons 
 the lady is now full on yelling at me insisting that i’m breaking the law and that she can sue me for not taking her coupon 
 on this particular day thank god we actually had hired an off duty uniformed police officer to sit at the entrance to the tent acting as security 
 we do that on our <unk> days because it’s a great <unk> for theft and it builds <unk> with the local police since they make great extra money for a really easy gig see here besides they love my mom’s cajun cooking 
 the lady stomps away from the counter and approaches the police officer to obviously raise hell about me 
 before she can say anything the officer looks her in the eyes and says <unk> moment <unk> the calls over to me loudly enough for everyone to hear 
 **officer : ** did you want me to arrest her or just throw her out 
 **me : ** it’s up to you 
 you’ve got to fill out the paperwork 
 she left without another word 
 -- -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here preface : i work at a telecommunications kiosk in a mall in canada 
 as we <unk> got a moment of quiet i decided to start wiping my kiosk down with lysol wipes 
 i also noticed at this time that a price card holder had fallen off of the kiosk and so i had to replace it 
 part of replacing it involves wiping the area with a goo remover '' to get the old glue off so the new one will stick perfectly fine 
 as i 'm doing this a kid walks up right against my kiosk and walks away 
 suddenly a very loud woman starts <unk> at me 
 & gt woman : what the **fuck** did you try and poison my child with 
 & gt me : i ... what 
 & gt woman : my child put his mouth on **your** kiosk and now he says <unk> mouth is <unk> 
 ** & gt me : well ... i just <unk> it with lysol ... and a glue remover 
 & gt woman : **you tried to poison my child** & gt me : no i was cleaning 
 *you* neglected to watch your child 
 who lets their child lick a kiosk i mean really 
 & gt woman : **what 's your customer service number i 'm going to report <unk> & gt me : right here ma'am 
 seriously 
 why 
 why are people so damn stupid i work electronics in a regional retailer and an elderly lady came in early today and was looking at the 3ds systems 
 being the customer service rockstar i am i went to help her 
 & gt me : can i help you find anything ma'am 
 & gt lady : yes i was wondering if this 3ds will play games for the wii 
 i had a brief did i really get asked that '' moment but <unk> quickly 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but they do n't 
 & gt lady : what 
 how will my granddaughter play this wii game i got her 
 & gt me : only the wii and wii u can play wii games 
 & gt lady : but you 're all out of those 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry ma'am 
 it is christmas eve so a lot of the last minute shoppers came in very early this morning and took the rest of them 
 & gt lady : you know this is terrible customer service 
 i opened my mouth to tell her we were expecting more systems on friday but she just took her cart off in a huff 
 merry christmas everyone so at the pet store i work at we require certain information when taking returns if you are getting cash or store credit back 
 namely we need your name address phone number and driver 's license 
 so a few days ago i had this really talkative lady tl come in and buy a bunch of stuff for a hamster she was buying at our competitor 
 why she was buying the stuff she needed to house it from us i do n't know but whatever 
 anyway she comes back today with the food in tow and claims that the little guy - a chinese <unk> - was n't eating it and her vet said it was because it was n't the food he had been eating before 
 well ... no shit i thought 
 not my fault she did n't specify that she needed a specific food but whatever x2 i started the return anyway 
 so i process the reciept scanned the food and tell her the return amount and also that she 'd have to give some information for filing purposes 
 she says okay i hand her a pen and the slip and she fills it all out going on about how it 's so sad that her little rat it 's a fucking hamster dammit was n't eating the past *four days 
 * she hands me the slip and i point out that she needed to fill out the phone number section 
 we get in trouble if it is n't filled out 
 & gt tl : oh no i do n't give out my number 
 that 's too private 
 & gt me : uhh ... okay but we just need it to give you your money back 
 & gt tl : whatever i 'm not giving it out 
 *sigh* whatever 
 i write a big ol refused in the phone number section and enter it all in and at *that* point she goes off with her returned money to find some other stuff to buy 
 comes back with some toys and i ring her up 
 & gt me : okay so your total is $ x.xx 
 do you have a rewards card 
 & gt tl : oh yeah let me give you my phone number 
 it 's ... fuck you so much lady.i used to work at a well-known boutique grocery store that is beloved for its quirky mostly <unk> products 
 i worked at a store in a major american city 
 i 'm a straight male 
 this is important 
 one day i was floating on the floor and a guy about my age mid-twenties at the time asks me a question about beer 
 he then struck up a conversation and it did n't take long before he said the following : i read an article that gay men in our city are increasingly shopping at name of store because of all the attractive men who work there '' 
 i responded i had n't heard that '' 
 hopefully that line worked for him on someone else i was working up at the cash register and a man was buying 4 new books for his <unk> daughter 
 after i finished the transaction he hands the bag of books to his daughter saying happy birthday '' 
 the daughter rolled her eyes and walked away 
 after this the father says 
 i 'm sorry but i have to return these books because someone is being an ungrateful little brat '' 
 and he actually went through with it and made her watch the return 
 it 
 was 
 amazing 
 my co-workers and i were all in awe 
 this man seriously deserves dad of the year award 
 edit for those asking for more context : he did n't yell happy birthday '' at her for everyone to hear i suppose i should n't have put it in all caps 
 he just said it as he was trying to hand her the bag that she refused to take 
 i saw it as a <unk> <unk> experience and the books looked like they were clearly picked out by her not the father 
 they obviously were n't her only birthday <unk> a quick one that surprised me 
 i work at a small tourist attraction with <unk> <unk> who dress up in <unk> 
 a guy came in and asked to take a picture with one of them and if it cost anything 
 we joked with him saying it would cost $ 200 bucks then saying we 'd settle for a box of donuts 
 he laughed took a picture and left 
 5 minutes later he showed up with a dozen donuts and said to enjoy them 
 he knew we were joking so it was a bit surprising 
 still put a smile on our faces 
 this story happened a couple of hours ago 
 i 'm badly bruised and tired and for some reason i wanted to tell my story before i take a warm bath and go to bed 
 i apologized in advance if it seems rushed 
 my boss had an incredible idea to have a gaming lounge upstairs 
 he bought it when the pizza place got sued because of <unk> incident 
 i am not usually assigned to the lounge but i was there when this all went down 
 anyways there was a battle going on against two clans ages about 18-25. they were playing dota and boy they were taking it very seriously 
 i 'm talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> and just basically swearing their greasy heads off <unk> while they play 
 well after the other clan won the <unk> of the group stands up and just flipped the other team the bird with both hands and just insulted them with all the swears he knows 
 it would make a sailor blush i tell ya 
 this went on about a minute before a member of the other clan got pissed and he grabbed his keyboard and just bitch slap the fuck out of the dude 
 that was the <unk> that erupted into an <unk> 
 the two clans started fighting grabbing chairs <unk> their drinks and just went bat-shit insane and just started <unk> with each other 
 my co-worker and i tried our best to keep them from destroying the entire lounge 
 while my co-worker was trying to regain the control of the situation and getting beaten up 
 i helped it and it got me a punch in the face 
 now i have anger issues and it triggers when i 'm physically hurt 
 my blood boiled and i grabbed the guy who punched me 
 he is the biggest and oldest among them but my rage filled self does n't care and i punched him at his <unk> 
 hard 
 he went down like a sack of potatoes 
 every body shut the fuck up '' 
 i screamed that did the trick as everyone stopped 
 bossman entered the doors with three <unk> behind him 
 apparently he went upstairs and saw the <unk> and he immediately called the cops 
 the two clans were arrested and we were questioned 
 they 'll spend the night in jail 
 25 year old that i punched wants to press charges dad tells him it was self defense and we can charge for assault 
 police agreed 25 year old shits pants 
 parents got called begged for the police bossman and my dad not to press charges on them 
 my dad was so pissed but i asked him not to sue 
 parents were asked to pay for all the damages to the lounge about $ <unk> and co-worker 's hospital bill as he broke his arm and have a bruised <unk> 
 bossman gave me paid 1 week vacation 
 i only have a bruised face knuckles and i think i chipped a tooth 
 edit : just got a text that co-worker would press charges 
 edit : answering some questions 
 & gt why the parents are being called 
 in the <unk> it 's very common to still live with your parents in your late 20s 
 <unk> some of the guys are scared of going to jail that they called their parents and all of them followed suit 
 & gt why do they call it a clans if it 's dota 
 any <unk> group that does n't have a <unk> will be called a clan 
 & gt did you really knock a guy with one punch 
 i apologize that i did not tell that very well 
 i am a girl but a very big girl 
 the dude the oldest and biggest but he was a runt compared to me 
 they are pretty skinny bunch 
 the dude was also very beaten up so i just basically finished him ... that sounded weird 
 & gt how can there be a restaurant upstairs 
 the building has two floors and there is a little stairs by the side so you can go to the pizza place 
 it 's very common setup two businesses on one building 
 i honestly do n't know how you can be confused 
 & gt what is with the rat in the pizza story 
 i have no idea 
 i 've worked at a major supermarket chain in australia for almost nine years so i have a lot of regular customers who i adore 
 yesterday was my birthday so naturally i was rostered on to work 
 while i was on my tea break one of my favourite regulars chases after me asking me about light globes 
 she 's a little old italian lady who always says things like god bless you 
 you are like a granddaughter to me 
 sometimes she can be a bit hard to understand as her english is good but not perfect so we play charades trying to guess what it is that she wants 
 for instance one day she kept drawing a square with her hands in the air while i guessed a box 
 no a baking tray 
 she wanted frozen puff pastry sheets 
 anyway i happily help her with the light globes and mention that it 's my birthday before i go on my break 
 15 minutes later when i get back to the kiosk one of my co-workers says that lady 's been waiting for you 
 i think she has something for you '' 
 she waited my whole tea break to give me a box of chocolates 
 she comes up to me covers my cheeks in <unk> and wishes me a happy birthday while doing her usual god bless you you 're like a granddaughter to me '' 
 sometimes i really do love customers 
 reading some of these stories reminded me of a time i used to work at a fast food restaurant a couple years back 
 i was handing out food at the drive through and a customer ordered an ice cream cone she pulled up to the window and i politely attempted to hand her the ice cream 
 she gave me a disgusted look and said i 'm not having that you just breathed on it 
 let me speak to your manager '' 
 i happily accepted and went and told my manager what happened 
 he started laughing took the ice cream off me walked out of the view of the customer and returned with the same ice cream and said there you go darling sorry about that here 's a fresh one '' 
 she gave me a <unk> smile and drove off licking her <unk> on ice cream 
 edit : my manager was great he once threw a pikey over a small fence when she spat in his face 
 edit 2 : a pikey is an irish traveler they tend to steal harass and generally cause a nuisance to the unfortunate areas they choose to call home for the next couple of <unk> 
 not all are like this as i have been reassured many times on traveler related tv shows but i have yet to meet a nice <unk> was n't sure where to post this since it was n't me that was mistaken 
 if it 's in the wrong spot lem me know 
 i 'm working on an aisle bringing stock to the front of the shelves making a wall '' tidying up walking customers around to the items they 're searching for and i hear a faint excuse me '' 
 from a man over in another aisle 
 i 'm guessing they spotted another floor associate and continue with my business organizing the jelly jar section 
 suddenly the excuse me 
 s get louder and louder and angrier and angrier 
 uh oh 
 i start walking over as it <unk> and the man 's angry voice is joined by a female voice 
 is a co-worker getting yelled at 
 i do n't recognize the voice ... i start hearing their heating conversation 
 & gt man : why were you ignoring me 
 i want to know where the paper towel is 
 & gt '' i do n't know where it is i do n't <unk> & gt man : you should know you work here 
 as i 'm rounding the corner i 'm getting confused 
 no new people were hired recently newest department change was me and i know where 90 % of the stuff is in the store 
 how can they not know if they work here 
 i turn the corner and see a middle aged man yelling at a girl in a blue shirt 
 oh no 
 my store uniform was blue but has been a grey striped shirt for over a year 
 & gt '' i do n't work here 
 i work at dept 
 store 
 & gt man : no you do n't 
 i know my chain 
 they always wear blue like you 
 stop being a lazy cow 
 where are the paper towels 
 & gt me : sir 
 she does n't work here 
 paper towels are in aisle 1. he turns around and spots my uniform and looks back at the girl 
 normally you 'd get a sorry right 
 oh no ... & gt man : ... why is she wearing the old uniform 
 is she lazy 
 the girl kinda ... snaps 
 & gt '' <unk> dept 
 store logo on <unk> i. work 
 at 
 dept 
 store 
 i do n't work at my chain 
 it 's people like you that make me hate my job and hate my life 
 i hate people like you 
 leave me alone '' 
 i wish i had a camera 
 the dude 's face was priceless as this girl just kept lighting him up and flying further and further off the handle 
 the whole store went quiet and the man sheepishly asks me again for directions to the paper towel 
 a few co-workers arrived hearing the yelling and asked if i was abusing a customer 
 i explain what happened and point out the girl now in tears 
 the managers talk to her and she finishes her purchase and leaves 
 i felt sorry for her 
 her day had to have been bad for her to snap like that 
 tl dr : customer gets mistaken for a store employee gets yelled at she responds by bringing the wrath of a thousand disgruntled employees down on his head 
 today i got to play supervisor '' for the beverage cart managed by our restaurant 
 edit : we are located on amusement park grounds and are only responsible for maintaining the cart 
 we do not own it and it is not located inside the restaurant 
 crappy ms paint <unk> 
 our cart clerk called off this morning so we had to have one of our <unk> work the cart 
 he had never worked at our food cart before so my manager asked if i would stay and help him for a while until he got comfortable 
 as we were stocking the cart a girl probably about 15 came up and asked if she could have a soda 
 us : sure that 'll be $ 3.00 her : ok $ 3.00 
 grabs bottle and tries to walk away without paying 
 us : uh ... excuse me that soda is $ 3.00 
 her : yep $ 3.00 
 continues to try to walk away with the soda without paying us : ma'am you need to give us $ 3.00 if you want that soda 
 her : yeah $ 3.00 again tries to walk away without paying us : ma'am do you have $ 3.00 on you 
 her : no ... us : then you need to give that soda back 
 we ca n't give it to you until you pay us 
 her : oh ok ... gives soda back and starts to walk away but comes back a few seconds later 
 can i have a bottle of water then 
 us : ... do you have money to pay for it 
 her : no ... us : then no we can not sell you water if you do n't give us money first 
 greetings tfr here is a badly <unk> verbal exchange for you all 
 i 'll set the scene : a couple of young girls <unk> came to the petrol station yesterday after some cigarettes 
 it 's not uncommon for young people to come to us since major uk supermarkets use a think 25 '' policy on tobacco products - as a small shop we are perceived as being more lenient 
 anyway they pulled up and a big girl looked about 17 got out 
 i looked away because she started doing star jumps - much to her friends amusement but i did n't want to see that 
 sorry i digress 
 the conversation went as follows sjg = star jump girl i 'll be me '' sjg : can i have 10 redacted cigarettes 
 no <unk> no please - no problem 
 /s me : yes certainly can i see some id please 
 sjg : oh really 
 do i not look 18 
 me : no i 'm afraid not but you should be flattered 
 <unk> sjg : oh fine <unk> out and talks to her <unk> her friend looked a little older was wearing a <unk> and shall be called ts accordingly 
 in she walks ts : can i have exact same cigarettes 
 *starts removing items from her <unk> me : *thinking she was looking for <unk> yes ... ... ts : well 
 me : oh i need to see your id i thought that 's what you were getting out ts : oh are you serious 
 i drove here 
 me : the driving age here is 17 you need to be 18 to buy cigarettes ts : oh come on 
 i have 2 kids 
 me : well i do n't know that do i 
 ts : oh i have a tattoo *pulls up top to show small <unk> me : that 's not id it does n't prove you 're 18. how do i know they checked your id 
 ts : you have to have id to get a tattoo 
 me : and you have to have id to buy cigarettes ts : ugh you 're just being difficult 
 and back to the car she went flipping the bird honking the horn and driving off into the night 
 it was a good effort but even if she was 18 she was buying for her friend who was n't 18 anyway 
 it <unk> me when they know they 're in the wrong but act all outraged at me as if i 'm being so unreasonable but as far as i 'm concerned i won ***side note*** some people have quite <unk> said that i should have point blank have refused the sale due to the obvious reason that ts was buying for sjg a <unk> sale '' 
 i explained somewhere in the <unk> of comments below but thought i 'd add it here that i agree but i thought it was easier to argue with a proven lack of id - if i 'd said no they 're for your friend '' she could have potentially argued with <unk> time poster been meaning to share this for a while 
 so i used to work in a mom and pop restaurant as a server 
 it was a great job and i was regularly recognized as a great server 
 i loved my job and being good at it gave me a lot of pride 
 i would typically work after school and from <unk> saturday 
 <unk> were typically crazy busy a lot of older folks in for the good deals and great food 
 it wasn’t uncommon to be completely full for 4-5 hours in the morning and sometimes <unk> take tables in other server’s sections to help with the load 
 one saturday things were going as normal and i was <unk> along 
 it got to be about 11:30 and lunch was beginning to come out of the kitchen 
 when i noticed something it took a moment to hit exactly what i was looking at 
 there was a table of an older married couple that i <unk> but why did i recognize them… 
 oh my <unk> they were my table from another server’s section 
 a rush of blood went straight to my <unk> this table got here at about <unk> what time was it 
 <unk> it couldn’t be 
 i felt <unk> i hadn’t seen them in at least 2 hours 
 so i go over and the exchange went something like this 
 me : i.. i am so sorry.. i don’t even know what to say 
 it has been a really busy morning and i just lost track of <unk> i can’t begin to apologize <unk> i am so sorry 
 him : with about the <unk> smile i ever remember seeing he takes his <unk> hand and says don’t worry about it 
 we enjoy each <unk> company 
 it was the sweetest thing i’d ever seen 
 i tried <unk> their meal but he had none of it 
 they paid in full and left me a $ 5 tip on about a $ 10 bill 
 to this day it was one of the most forgiving and genuine acts of love i’d ever seen 
 i’ll never forget it 
 tl : dr i’m an idiot and left a table sitting for damn near 2 hours 
 after i realized the old man assured me that the time spent with his wife wasn’t wasted 
 i work at a high-end movie theater where we serve people in nice <unk> seats 
 yesterday was my fourth day working there and a family came in to see maleficent in 3d 
 the mom calls me over and asks if this movie is in 3d which i politely answer yes too 
 she complains that she hates 3d movies and did n't order 3d 
 i tell her to sit tight and see what i could do for her 
 i grab my manager and explain the situation and he says the family bought tickets online not our fault she ordered the wrong theater but he offered to have her switch to a later showing in 2d and we would refund the extra money 
 i go back to inform the guest what was decided and she said that since her kids were already comfortable in the seats that they were going to stay in that theater and expect us to switch the movie to a 2d version 
 i explained to her that it was n't possible and apologized 
 she states that she will just refuse to wear the 3d glasses for the movie then ... edit : she died in her sleep 
 at least she was n't in pain and did n't suffer 
 i worked again today and was in tears as soon as i saw my other coworkers 
 by now everyone has been told 
 and it really struck hard 
 what 's normally a <unk> cheerful environment full of laughter was total silence 
 none of us would talk aside from greeting a customer giving total and saying bye to the customer 
 no small talk 
 no laughter no loud noises 
 most of the customers sensed something had happened 
 a lot of people were in the break room taking breathers and being idle grieving in our own <unk> 
 some went home early a lot of workers from other stores were there 
 the mood felt like a real thick heavy fog as soon as you walked in the door 
 end edit 
 we do n't know what happened 
 her daughter called this morning 
 i arrived at 3:30pm for my shift and noticed her name on the <unk> was crossed off 
 i thought nothing of it 
 just thought she had a sick day or something come up 
 it was busy 
 very busy 
 for most of my shift it was one customer after the other and i noticed the morale was low 
 i just thought it was because of being down two workers and being really busy 
 i finished my shift thinking all was fine 
 was a busy shift but was glad that it was over 
 as i 'm walking out to my car the duty manager stops me says she needs to talk to me 
 i assumed it was about the <unk> man wandering around earlier 
 we called the police and they took him in but maybe since i was there i needed a <unk> 
 and then she told me about my co-worker 
 it was like <unk> a brick 
 just a huge weight <unk> to the bottom of my stomach 
 someone so healthy full of life always happy and such a good worker ... gone 
 she was n't sick she was n't that old 
 she 'd only be in her early fifties 
 we were exchanging cute cat videos the last time we were on break together 
 laughing at cats and kittens on <unk> 
 i 'm still trying to register that i 'll never work with her again 
 never see her again or hear her again 
 she 's gone 
 so i say to you guys live life to the fullest 
 these jobs may suck and the people may be horrible but enjoy what you can 
 you never know when time is up 
 it does n't matter how healthy you are you never know 
 rest peacefully <unk> 
 we love and miss you so much 
 i work for a company that is kind of known for selling everything 
 well today while stocking some pasta sauce i heard a convo between a young boy and his mother 
 the boy was complaining about not getting a toy while the mother replied if you behaved youd get it 
 but you are n't behaving so i may just return you to everything store '' 
 the young boy came up to me 
 yb : excuse me 
 do you really sell kids here 
 me : we sure do 
 it 's just sometimes they can be a little to wild so we keep them in back 
 yb : really 
 me : yup 
 they 're mostly good kids but sometimes we get a bad one in the bunch 
 they tend to get returned 
 yb : did i come from here 
 me : i 'm not to sure 
 i think i remember seeing you but i ca n't be sure 
 let me bar code 
 it 's on your neck so if you could just turn around for a second 
 i pretended to scan him me : yup ... <unk> 
 it looks like you were <unk> 
 i looked at the mother to talk to her me : i 'm sure if you take him to the service desk they 'll just trade him out for a newer model 
 at this point the boy looked scared while the mother was trying not to lose herself i the laughter 
 mom : thanks but i think i 'll keep him for a little while 
 she walked off trying not to smile 
 i did n't here the kid complain about that toy for the rest of their <unk> work at a coffee shop that also serves soups and sandwiches 
 today i was working the sandwich station 
 when orders pop up on my screen they 're labelled either eat in '' or take out '' depending on what the cashier punched in 
 an order comes up- a bunch of soups and sandwiches to go 
 so as i was finishing placing their food into bags a rude lady rl pipes up : & gt '' surely you 're not bagging up all my food '' 
 & gt me : yeah it says <unk> go on my screen '' 
 & gt rl : she scoffs well i want it for here 
 what is so difficult about that for you '' 
 & gt me : ... i just follow my screen 
 i 'm sorry 
 usually a customer will tell us if they 're eating in otherwise we assume it 's to go 
 i 'll remake this for here '' 
 i said this in a pretty neutral tone i just wanted her to know for future so we do n't waste more materials bagging her food next time 
 & gt rl : well i never 
 i should n't have you tell you guys whether i 'm eating here or not '' 
 i just bite my tongue and continue on 
 as i 'm walking away to grab some china plates a co-worker cw asked her if there was anything he could do as she was visibly irritated : & gt rl : no 
 the girl was being very rude '' 
 & gt cw : ma'am she has a <unk> it 's <unk> 
 we would thank you to show us a little respect '' 
 after that the rude lady completely shut up and took her food to go 
 <unk> to work at the weekend after a short <unk> when someone hit me with a fridge they were stealing my colleague let 's call her rose is with me on the customer service desk making sure that i 'm ok on my first shift back when she spots someone 
 she points him out to me 
 & gt rose : that guy wearing the <unk> coat is a shoplifter 
 he 's banned from the town centre so tries his luck out here 
 he 's not very successful 
 & gt me : why 
 & gt rose : watch him 
 he 's on the <unk> 
 shoplifter then proceeds to head towards the mobile phone display at the rear of the store 
 these are dummy units made to resemble the actual phone 
 they have a massive bolt through them that slots into a <unk> on the display and is held down by a cord but our shoplifter is either too high or too stupid to realise this 
 smartphone = cash = whatever his fix is 
 sidenote 
 our store is fairly large but is laid out so you ca n't take the smaller items and have a straight run at the exit 
 i know for a fact that there are two uniformed guards around the store both of which at this point are closer to the door than the shoplifter 
 shoplifter makes a show of checking his phone and looking for accessories 
 he picks up a case a charger headset reading the boxes before looking around 
 the security guards are not looking in his direction 
 he grabs the nearest dummy smartphone still not realising that it 's a dummy and starts to run 
 before now i never realised how much of the cord can <unk> before it stops 
 for anyone else curious about this the answer is not much 
 our <unk> thief gets no more than two metres before it stops and like in a cartoon he is <unk> backwards and to the floor 
 <unk> he stands up and tries again snapping the cord and running off with the dummy phone 
 i honestly do n't know what was <unk> - the drop to the floor the look on his face when the police informed him that he had stolen a dummy phone or the fact that the security staff and the duty manager were really trying hard not to laugh at the guy as he was led away in <unk> tale i have is an elderly customer who used to come in once a week for <unk> we used to have a bit of a chat it was a social outing for her for the week 
 i did n't see her for a couple of weeks a letter <unk> up to work 
 it turns out she had passed on and left me all her antique furniture and for my family to live in her place until we all die rent free 
 best i can tell she did it to screw over her kids who never paid her attention 
 very awkward position that took some <unk> work to get out of and not come across as a scam artist had to update my <unk> for this and everything 
 this happened about a few minutes ago 
 i come in to work in the morning to open up the store i work as a guy trying to sell you phones and i start setting up the place 
 wiping the counter cashing in and making sure all our phones in the back are fine and dandy 
 anyways the first few hours by myself pass just fine without any customers walking through the door and i continue browsing tfr 
 eventually the other coworker comes by to relieve me so i can go on my break 
 i start to think about to have for my lunch as i forgot to bring it with me in the morning and as i 'm <unk> over a sandwich or something else from a local coffee chain nearby i hear the door open and happen to overhear this conversation between my co-worker and the customer 
 & gt coworker : good afternoon sir welcome to <unk> store name here* how can i <unk> '' & gt customer : hey i have to go real badly do you have a washroom '' 
 & gt cw : umm yes just in the back here '' & gt customer : oh thank you ive been holding it in for a while '' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at this point i 'm wondering if he 's really running into the washroom or if he 's coming into the break room he sounds really close *door opens* the conversation now continues with me and the customer 
 & gt customer : this is weird why 's there a table in the washroom 
 oh well excuse me please '' *he grabs a nearby empty cup and <unk> *i immediately back up putting a table between customer and me* & gt me : whoa sorry sir but this is n't a washroom this is our <unk> '' *customer starts to pee into the <unk> & gt me : sir this is not a washroom please stop peeing where we eat '' *he finishes up* & gt customer : oh ... sorry '' <unk> up and thankfully takes his pee cup with him outside* i stood there stunned as all hell as to what just happened 
 after about 3 minutes i grabbed my things and left the break room 
 called up my manager and told her i 'm taking the day off 
 have a good rest of your shift reddit 
 *edits for <unk> tfr 
 long time lurker first time posting 
 some background i work at a pretty nice gym 
 it has a <unk> <unk> and all that <unk> 
 any way 
 it is our policy that when members want to bring a guest for the day that they have to pay a guest fee 
 for adults 15 and older its 10 bucks a day 
 for children 15 and under it 's 5 bucks a day 
 however if you 're under 15 and do n't have a person who is 18 years or older to supervise you you ca n't get in 
 story time 
 it was a holiday when this occurred 
 now on holidays we 're pretty busy 
 kids are out of school parents looking for something for their children to do etc 
 i was on the phone when these three girls came in 
 my coworker was handing them guest forms for them to fill in and telling them that it was 10 dollars to get in 
 i had to help another customer but i could hear that they were arguing with him about something 
 he got paged to go help in another department so i took over for him 
 hi '' 
 i greeted them 
 it 's 10 dollars each 
 will you be paying together or separately '' 
 ummmm yeah 
 we were told that it was going to be only 5 dollars each '' 
 the girls looked at each other and rolled their eyes 
 their friend that was the member shows up at the front desk 
 note that he is 16 
 well actually that 's the children 's price '' 
 oh '' 
 the girls looked at each other 
 well i 'm <unk> under 15 you have to give me the child 's price '' 
 the other two piped in 
 yeah we 're 13 '' 
 oh well i 'm sorry but then i ca n't let you in '' 
 their mouths dropped open 
 i answered the phone as the girls <unk> with the their friend 
 i finished the call and see them holding out their credit cards to pay 
 i 'm sorry but unless you 're 15 i ca n't let you in '' 
 i say as i smile sweetly 
 you have to be <unk> by someone 18 or older '' 
 they do n't know how the rules work '' 
 the member <unk> out 
 oh '' 
 i raise my eyebrow at them 
 look i 'm sorry 
 i 'm actually 15. we all are '' 
 the lead girl said 
 that 's funny you told me you were 14 a second ago '' 
 i know 
 i 'm actually 15. she probably was they all looked about upper high-school age 
 are you ... '' 
 i stared at her intently almost like i was trying to stare into her soul 
 she <unk> 
 yes 
 i apologise '' 
 her voice wobbled 
 i was trying to get the cheaper price '' 
 victory 
 i stared at her a moment longer 
 okay '' 
 i <unk> happily 
 that 'll be 10 bucks '' 
 the one thing i do n't like about being a cashier is the amount of people who believe i 'm a high school drop out or something 
 backstory : i first started using <unk> and autocad in 2010 college i was doing drafting 
 so this lady comes up and i ring her up i convince her to sign up for our rewards program & gt ok ma'am i will also need your email address 
 well so it begins 
 & gt it 's my first name and last name followed by the number one spelled out 
 as in oh as in one n as in new and then e as in eat ... c as in cat a as in apple d as in dog 
 oh cool cad i remember autocad & gt ok ma'am oh cool cad 
 you do drafting 
 she seemed a bit shocked to see me say that 
 & gt oh 
 i 'm surprised you know what that word means 
 did your parents do it 
 no 
 & gt no i did 
 i do n't want to explain my life to someone 
 & gt well you 're not doing drafting right now ... let me guess you failed because it was to hard 
 it 's ok its not for everyone some people just do n't have the <unk> 
 i had to drop out of college so i can pay my bills in could n't afford rent car etc not full time 
 i did n't say anything after that and did my best not to call her a bitch while i handed her her things 
 but damn does that make my blood <unk> 
 background : i work for a consumer electronics store 
 i 've worked in nearly every department and this particular exchange happened when i was working at the asset protection desk 
 lady : you guys are sold out of this item can i get a raincheck 
 me : sure you 'll just have to go to the customer service desk and they can issue one for you 
 lady : i do n't have time to stand in line ca n't you just give me one here 
 me : i 'm sorry but i do n't have a computer here to issue <unk> 
 there is only one person in line at customer service i 'm sure they 'll be done soon 
 lady : so what you are saying is you 're not going to help me 
 i 'm never coming to this store again 
 <unk> out of the store* me : <unk> another satisfied <unk> here 's another story from my <unk> at a sandwich shop 
 a while back i was working and a lady came in 
 she looked grumpy so i <unk> myself for the worst 
 me : hi 
 how can i help you today 
 gl : i want a 12 '' ham on <unk> 
 so i make it for her and was just about to put it in the <unk> when she asks if she can get bacon on there which i happily oblige to 
 so i finish making her sandwich and surprisingly nothing annoying had happened yet 
 so i ring her up and tell her the price when she gets this pissed off look on her face 
 gl : hey 
 i thought that was supposed to be $ 5.00 
 me : sorry ma'am 
 bacon costs $ 1.00 extra 
 gl : ugh 
 if i would have known that i <unk> have gotten it 
 you were supposed to tell me 
 me : i 'm sorry ma'am but all of our prices are listed on the signs directly above me 
 i assumed you were aware that bacon is n't free and had looked at our signs and understood our prices 
 gl : that is ridiculous 
 i should n't have to look at the signs 
 that bacon should be free and i 'm not paying for it 
 i had enough of her at this point 
 me : tell that to the deli at the <unk> store and see what they tell you 
 i 'm sorry but bacon has never been free and you will pay for it or you 're not getting it 
 gl : i want to talk to your manager 
 the best part : my manager was up there the whole time 
 he just stared at her turned around and walked away 
 needless to say she paid for her <unk> few days ago i was in box office at the chain movie theater i 've been working my senior year of high school 
 it was in the middle of a big rush and a coworker one of my managers and i were working through the line efficiently 
 some woman 35 y.o 
 or so with younger kids got to the front of the very long line and had no idea what movie she wanted to see so she stepped to the side out of the line this is important and told me to take the next few guests 
 a solid 6-7 minutes later the woman interrupted me while i was with a customer and demanded her tickets 
 given that she 'd been loitering for that long and the line was down to maybe 5 people i asked that she wait until i 'm done serving the people in line bear in mind with 3 cashiers this would have taken <unk> minutes tops 
 she proceeded to flip at least several shits saying something along the lines of how dare you 
 i already waited in line 
 i 'm a paying customer 
 i do n't like that '' 
 trying to maintain calm i told her she could go over to guest services where there was no line and they could help her out very quickly 
 apparently the <unk> walk was n't worth it so she just got back in line glaring at me the whole time 
 when she reached the front my coworker was the one who ended up helping her but she decided to interrupt a transaction -- again -- to come and yell at me saying i ca n't believe some high school dropout can tell me to wait in line again '' 
 at this point my manager who is also a total bro looked over smiled and said ma'am that 'high school dropout you 're insulting is actually in the top 10 % of his class and is going to one of the best <unk> in the country this fall 
 wrongly insulting him when he 's doing his job 100 % correctly wo n't get you anywhere '' 
 she stood with her mouth open for a moment glancing between my manager and me 
 we both smiled at her she got her tickets 
 when she got her soda she promptly spilled it and was made to pay for another one by the same manager 
 tl dr : do you see what you get <unk> 
 do you see what you get when you mess with the <unk> 
 it never fails weekend nights i 'm <unk> customers out the door at closing time every time 
 most of them just need a little push not literal though i 'd love it to be sometimes towards the door but some are special little snowflakes who are <unk> gon na stay here as long i as want you peon '' 
 good thing our lighting is controlled by corporate and goes down to pretty much emergency lighting about ten minutes after we close 
 you can see but it is <unk> that the store is closed 
 i was making my rounds the other night after having closed the last register when lo and behold what to my <unk> eyes did appear but a special little snowflake sls coming up the up <unk> into the men 's department 
 i intercepted her at the top landing and asked which exit door she needed to use as they were all locked at this point 
 sls : oh no i 'm not leaving i need to look at men 's bathing suits 
 me : m'am the store is closed i can escort you to an exit and unlock it for you 
 sls : no 
 show me where the <unk> are 
 me : m'am again the store is closed the registers are all shut down we open tomorrow at ten am which exit door would you like to use 
 sls : none 
 i demand you show me to the men 's bathing suits 
 you are not closing until i ... <unk> 
 lights go out sls : clearly <unk> why are the lights off 
 me : because as i said we are closed 
 now which exit did you need to use 
 sls : meekly points in the general direction of an exit i let her out she never says another word 
 so our pos system is stupid 
 you ca n't go back once you hit 'total so if the price does n't sound right to the customer you ca n't go back and tell them the price on everything 
 i had my manager come help me because i 'm still new and i all ready <unk> this order once 
 my manager then hits the 'total button tries to go back then turns to me ... <unk> what did you do '' 
 what do you mean what did i do '' 
 i ca n't go back '' 
 that 's because you hit total '' no i did n't 
 rering this up '' 
 ... '' so for the 3rd time i rang this customer up and the customer was just so fed up she did n't care about the price and left angrily 
 and apparently my manager thinks i ninja walked behind her pressed total and silently slipped away to my spot 2 feet away without her noticing 
 maybe it was just to spite her i 'm not sure since i did n't actually do that i 've been lurking here since i started my job at a supermarket and finally i have a story i want to share 
 i was working self service on saturday and somehow despite the fact that i 'd only been there half an hour it felt like i 'd received a full day 's abuse and i already hated every customer in existence 
 there was finally a quiet moment when miraculously i had no customers and a sweet little old man came up and decided to use the self service machine for the first time since there was no queue 
 he told me he 'd need some extra help and i was happy to especially because he was incredibly entertaining to talk to 
 i actually only had to show him where the scanner was because he carefully read and followed all of the directions on the screen 
 i went a <unk> up another machine so he did n't feel like i was hovering and when i came back he had finished his shop and was trying to pay for the shopping by waving his <unk> note in front of the scanner 
 i ca n't get it to work '' 
 he looked at me in confusion 
 i told him these machine confuse everyone when it comes to paying because all of them are different and showed him the hole the notes go in and he laughed at himself when he realised that of course the machines would n't scan anything without a barcode and then he told me he 'd probably be back in an hour because he 'll have bought the wrong milk and went off with his shopping bag to his <unk> just called the store 
 she says she ca n't get into her account and needs to to pay her bill 
 i kindly tell her i ca n't go into her account over the phone but if she has another phone to use she can call customer care to pay 
 she yells read my lips 
 i dont have access to my account '' 
 i said ma'am we 're talking on the phone 
 i ca n't read your lips '' 
 needless to say 
 she did n't like <unk> guys its been awhile 
 so a customer comes over to my co-workers register <unk> yesterday with a very disgusting dog bed - it was <unk> had hair all over it and a hole that was obviously made by said dog 
 the customer starts proclaiming : i want a refund i bought this dog bed two weeks ago and it is an absolute disgrace '' 
 queue co-worker getting manager over to speak with dog man dm for short dm : can you believe i 've had this dog bed for two weeks and my dog chewed a hole in it 
 i would like a refund '' 
 manager : sir we ca n't refund you because your dog chewed a hole in it '' 
 dm : you are n't going to stand behind your products 
 you need to give me a refund '' 
 manager : sir we are an <unk> retailer and we do n't make our own products 
 it 's a dog dogs are going to chew holes in things '' 
 dm : my dog does n't know it 's a dog 
 it has never done anything like this before it must be the dog bed '' 
 manager : i 'm not going to refund your money '' 
 dm : ok can i just leave it here then '' 
 my manager was literally trying not to laugh through the entire thing 
 after working in retail for over 4 years i can say that this is the most <unk> bold thing any of my customers has ever done.a few years back i used to work at a medium sized supermarket in the uk 
 we all used to send each other warning emails if ever someone tried a scam at one of our stores even if the store was the other side of the friggin country 
 i remember once getting an email that actually impressed me 
 it was a two man operation and essentially it was a gift card scam 
 they 'd load a large trolley <unk> of shopping and make their way to the checkout 
 they would also have a gift card 
 what would happen next is that they 'd get the cashier to put £500 on the gift card at the start of the transaction 
 the cashier would then continue to scan each item and then one of the guys would disappear 
 when the cashier had finished scanning everything the dude left behind would suddenly realise he 'd left his wallet in his car '' 
 he 'd then run out to go grab it ... only he 'd never come back 
 during this time the guy who did a <unk> act earlier had gone to another checkout with a £400+ tv and paid with his now pre-loaded £500 gift card 
 sometimes the <unk> of the shifty and dodgy amaze me 
 **edit : for <unk> after this incident our gift card policies were <unk> so that going forward gift cards were processed as the last item in the transaction and were n't had n't over until the transaction was closed and payment taken 
 **i 've had a rough week and yesterday at work something happened that cheered me up immensely 
 i work at a teen <unk> shop 
 a woman came in to shop while her husband obediently followed her carried her clothes and what not 
 eventually she comes to check out and she realized she forgot her purse 
 so being a good husband he goes out to the car to get it 
 on his way back in he sees myself my co-worker and his wife all waiting for him at the counter 
 he <unk> <unk> and then throws the bag over his shoulder like a <unk> model 
 as he <unk> back to the counter swinging his hips side to side and putting a little <unk> in his step he said in his <unk> <unk> oh sorry i just forgot my purse '' 
 might not be as funny on print but we were in a fit of giggles when he walked out the door with his <unk> wife 
 he was still carrying her bags- and still <unk> sure where else to post this but i really need to get this off my chest 
 i am a gymnastics coach and i generally love my job 
 i work with the upper level girls the ones that go out and compete even though i 'm considered pretty young college age to be coaching <unk> 
 we 're a pretty small gym and the parents are for the most part great to work with 
 but there is one 
 ohhhhh there is always that one 
 this mom a woman who takes pride in the fact that she is a children 's <unk> and basically a <unk> tutor is the most i 'm their friend first and their parent second '' 
 person i have ever met in my life when it comes to her children 
 she brought her daughter entitled mini witch emw for short to our program just under 4 years ago 
 now emw is talented but because her mother lets her get away with murder she is one of the most lazy rude and miserable children i have ever had to work with 
 i am absolutely heated in a conversation that happened during my lunch break and i just need to get this out of my system before going back for the team 's second work out because i 'm still livid 
 i 'm eating at the front desk and sorting through paperwork because it 's easier for me to just stay there rather than drive all the way back home then all the way back to the gym and there are no classes during the afternoon so my boss is fine with it 
 this mother storms into the gym marches straight up to the desk and says <unk> i am absolutely shocked and appalled by what emw told me today but i know kids can <unk> so i wanted to come talk to you before going to owner '' 
 <unk> shoot 
 i know exactly what 's coming 
 this girl came to practice 20 minutes late we were almost done with warm up and she was being generally unpleasant 
 but its <unk> and mornings suck so i was trying to be understanding 
 i got nothing but <unk> and i ca n't do event she does n't like my ankle <unk> '' 
 yet when we got to an event she enjoyed she was magically healed 
 i was having none of it 
 but like the good little peon i am i responded with oh uhm okay 
 what did emw tell you about practice '' 
 **mom** : she said that you made her condition for the whole practice while everyone else was working out 
 all practice 
 she was in tears by the time she got home because you were so rude to her '' alright now i 'm kind of agitated but i expected this kind of thing 
 this sounds like a typical case of a 13 year old girl who is blatantly <unk> her mother 
 regardless i know this family and i know that trying to explain this would go in one ear and out the other so i respond in my most <unk> customer service voice ah well i 'm sorry emw was crying after practice but i was trying to keep her as healthy as possible 
 see when she got here late i asked her to warm up on her own while we went to tumbling 
 as soon as she finished she got through two turns before complaining that her ankle hurt 
 i had her sit and ice it for 10 minutes take the ice off for 5 then had her come try tumbling again 
 she said it still hurt so i had her do the <unk> injury '' conditioning list so that she was still working while giving her ankle a break '' 
 **mom** : okay but then why did n't you let her do trampoline '' 
 understandable question but i was so sick of this girl coming up to me demanding to do trampoline insisting that her ankle felt better and that i was just a horrible mean person that i had had enough of the way she was treating me 
 i explained to the mother that if the impact of using nothing but a spring floor and her own momentum caused pain in emw 's ankle so badly that she could n't tumble adding a trampoline into that mix would absolutely cause her excruciating pain 
 i did n't want her to further injure herself so i had her finish the list '' 
 this is where it gets insane 
 this is where i legitimately expect to lose my stuffing 
 her mom decided to inform me emw was just being <unk> 
 i 'm sure her ankle was n't as bad as it seemed she just does n't like tumbling 
 i 'm sure you know that 
 she wanted to do trampoline though and i do n't understand why you would n't let her just because she was pretending to get hurt '' 
 what 
 no seriously what 
 my mind was absolutely blown 
 i was so <unk> i was <unk> to kick her out right then and there 
 but alas i kept my voice steady and my smile permanently plastered as i informed this mother i 'm sorry mrs. last name here at gym name we take athlete health and injuries very seriously 
 i had no way of knowing whether emw 's ankle was barely twisted or about to fall off 
 i had nothing but emw 's word to decide what to do 
 when an athlete says they are in that much pain i can not in good conscience allow them to further injure themselves 
 if emw wants to be a part of gymnastics she has to practice gymnastics 
 if she wants to be a part of trampoline there is a name of a business with wall to wall <unk> and a history of a lot of injuries that is pretty popular on the west coast about 20 minutes away '' 
 she huffed out and said that emw was n't feeling well and would not be coming to night practice today 
 i asked that she make sure emw gets some ice on that ankle as she walked out the door 
 i called the owner as soon as the mother left and let her know what happened 
 she just laughed and said she 'd take care of it if she got a call 
 sorry for the wall of text and if there is somewhere better to put this please let me know but i really just needed to get that out there 
 **edit** : i realized some of you might not know what conditioning is 
 its basically the strength part of gymnastics 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> things like that where you are n't actually doing anything completely gymnastics related just focusing on building muscle and <unk> 
 **edit 2** : obligatory holy shit i 'm on the front page '' 
 edit 
 but seriously thank you to everyone who <unk> and everyone who commented 
 y'all made my day so much better 
 if anyone was wondering second practice went very well and we even played a game at the end of practice 
 one of the girls asked where emw was and i explained that she was resting her ankle 
 one of my other girls asked you know she was faking right '' 
 my only response was i know '' and we moved on 
 very good very <unk> practice 
 i love my <unk> : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new year’s eve 
 **story : ** saying that we get a lot of interesting characters at the fireworks tent is an understatement of epic proportions 
 it 's the equivalent of saying <unk> <unk> has changed since <unk> on <unk> <unk> 
 one of our regulars is affectionately known as <unk> 
 the first time i met him he arrived at the tent riding a bicycle i should mention he was 19 then and looking for a very specific type of firework 
 he wanted something small less than 1/2 inch in <unk> that would shoot <unk> balls or some other object <unk> that exploded on impact 
 it also had to be less than 7 1/2 inches long 
 in retrospect i probably should have been more curious or concerned about his requirements 
 in all honesty i get so many strange questions and requests i do n't think his went above a 4 on my weird shit meter 
 i spent some time walking around with him and showing him different fireworks that might fit his needs 
 i suggested possibly a roman candle <unk> down in length since most of the tube is just empty space anyway 
 he browsed for a while and then left without buying anything 
 a few hours later he <unk> up to my tent again and asked if there was someplace private that we could talk 
 i was busy but now i was definitely more than a little curious 
 i led him outside of the tent and into my <unk> storage container reaching into his backpack he pulled out a set of black batman forearm guards similar to this but made completely out of metal 
 there was a metal cylinder that ran the length of the guard to support the blades 
 he had pulled the end off of the cylinder and wanted to shove the fireworks in the hole so that they could shoot out 
 i stupidly asked him what this was for and he looked at me dead in the eyes and told me that he could n't say 
 <unk> 
 ** it 's like that one perfect moment where time slows down and everything inexplicably comes together to create a magical point in time 
 it 's like hitting the <unk> in the bottom of the ninth <unk> to come from behind and win the big game 
 it 's like looking up and seeing the lottery numbers you picked displayed on screen after the drawing 
 it 's like watching your newborn baby draw their first breath 
 i was about to supply bat-shit crazy batman with his weapons 
 i spent the next hour personally <unk> roman candles so that they would fit in the cylinder 
 i provided him with a generous supply no charge of course 
 how can you charge batman for his weapons 
 he solemnly thanked me <unk> onto his bicycle and <unk> off into the sunset 
 i anxiously watched the news every night for weeks waiting for the tales of his exploits 
 alas they never appeared obviously covered up by the <unk> media in <unk> with the <unk> bosses 
 i see him every year back at the tent and browsing for fireworks 
 when our eyes lock we exchange a knowing nod and i always <unk> as to whether he needs any more ... '' supplies '' 
 he has not 
 obviously he 's now <unk> them from china in mass quantities under a <unk> company name so as to avoid suspicion 
 and so it begins 
 -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here so this just happened about 30 minutes ago 
 i work for a <unk> and it 's not that busy in the mornings but today was unusually busy 
 i 'm doing a shipment for a lady and this guy comes in asking if we send express mail and he has important documents to send remember this for later 
 i say yes we offer that service and give him an express envelope to put his stuff in 
 he seals the envelope immediately and asks if we do same day local delivery 
 again i say yes we offer that service but because he sealed the envelope already i just needed him to write the address of the receiver on a sticker so he does n't need to take his documents out of his envelope 
 for same day delivery we have to call a driver over so there 's no need to print a label and all that 
 apparently that was too much effort for this guy and goes : wow you guys have absolutely no clue what you 're doing 
 i 'm going to another location 
 let me talk to your manager '' 
 i am the manager '' i 'm 19 and asian so i probably look like i 'm 15 fuck this i 'm out '' what happened next was totally unexpected and hilarious 
 our express envelopes have a little strip you can tear down so you can open it without ruining the whole thing but mr. hulk here had a little <unk> in judgement so instead of tearing through the small strip he literally tore the envelope from top to bottom destroying his precious documents 
 as soon as he did that he just stood there stunned and i just burst out laughing and giggling and told him to gtfo the store 
 his face was red with embarrassment and he just stormed out with his ruined documents 
 tl dr : do n't piss in your own cereal edit : formatting posting from <unk> work at a large retail pet chain 
 we are constantly understaffed 
 for example today for a saturday it was me in pet care a cashier and one manager 
 it was awful 
 my manager posted some comments we got on a survey and i swear i want to meet the people who wrote this a hug them 
 why less than satisfied : the line was long 
 cashier called for help and it was a long time before anyone showed up 
 manager was not helping he was walking around '' 
 beautiful 
 edit : on break currently 
 store manager yelled at us because our offering of assistance scores were extremely low 30 % 
 huh i wonder why 
 so i work at an autopart store and today i had the most amazing thing happen 
 so this old lady comes in and i greet her and ask if she needs any help 
 well her car battery turned out to be bad and she needed a new one 
 so i looked it up and it cost $ 110 after turning in her old one 
 she agrees and i go grab it i ring it up and with the $ 15 core charge it comes out to around $ <unk> 
 she <unk> her debit card and it gets declined 
 she kind of sighs and she gets out her credit card and it is declined again 
 i can see she is almost in tears so i decide to remove the core charge in good faith that she will bring the old battery in and i take 10 % off the purchase 
 she is very thankful and we try to slide her card again and its declined 
 now i 'm feeling very bad 
 there was a lady that was being helped right next to us and she notices that the card was declined 
 she asks the lady if everything is okay 
 the old lady answers that she 's okay but unfortunately does n't have enough to buy the battery 
 she then tells me that she will be back to buy the battery after she goes and <unk> some money from one of her <unk> 
 then the amazing thing happens the other lady tells her not to worry that she will buy the battery for her 
 the old lady burst into tears and tells the other lady that its fine she does n't have to do it but the lady does n't take no for an answer 
 she swipes her card and pays for the battery 
 this old lady is in tears i 'm trying my best not to cry and so is my other coworker 
 the lady tells the old lady that she had recently got some money from an <unk> and that she did n't really need it 
 so she figured she would do a good deed and help someone out in need 
 i ask the old lady if she had anyone to put her new battery in and she replied no that she was planning on taking it to a shop 
 i told her not to worry that i would install her battery in for her 
 she started crying again and hugs the other lady and then runs up to me and hugs me 
 i drove her to where her car was <unk> and changed her battery 
 she was so thankful and told me that today would have been a horrible day if it was n't for me and the other lady 
 she tried to hand me a $ 20 bill for gas but i refused telling her this was my good deed for the day 
 i 've never seen such an act of kindness like i did today and i will never forget this day 
 tl : dr : old lady does n't have enough to buy a car battery random stranger buys the battery for her out of kindness and then i gave her a ride to her car and installed the battery for her 
 there was a lot of tears shed today by everyone 
 edit : thanks for the gold a couple of days ago i was pulling a double shift 9 <unk> and it was <unk> - four or five customers six associates in the store just another tuesday in retail 
 we 're across the street from a <unk> neighborhood so a lot of our customers come from there 
 lot of nice people some <unk> speakers but people who are super nice and make the job fun 
 around <unk> pm three teenage boys started to ride around the parking lot in their bikes 
 we do n't think much of this - it 's a large parking lot filled with many stores such as sprawl mart 
 we start picking up the carts from the parking lots as the three boys walk into the store playing with the laptops and tablets then the cameras 
 fine whatever we thought we 're almost closed so be it 
 then they entered the small electronics department and started to knock things over - throwing down ipad cases on the floor putting the music on loud and cursing at each other running around the <unk> area and putting terrible things on the smart tv 's websites with pornographic images loud music - note : we never blocked websites on the smart tv 's but now we do we never thought this would happen '' 
 my manager comes over talks to them but as he does they start calling him names - old man mcgee '' our boss last name is mcgee - as well as attempting to push around the vacuums and knocking things over 
 our manager a patient man who we never heard raise his voice yelled learn some <unk> manners and get out '' 
 the boys laughed and gave up and walked out the store as we cleaned up the mess they left us especially one in the furniture area who peed on the recliners 
 at close as we were removing the recliners and marking defective merchandise - move to <unk> '' on each of them a woman banged on our doors they were locked and screams open your doors '' 
 my manager walked up to the door and pointed to his watch we 're closed ma'am 
 we 'll be open at 10 am tomorrow for your shopping convenience '' 
 but then we see those three boys as well around her banging on the doors 
 the manager opened the doors slowly and as the woman tried to push herself in our manager blocked her entrance 
 ma'am we 're closed 
 and your boys left us a mess so even if we were open we would n't let you in 
 one of your boys peed on the recliners which is going to lose us money on each one 
 we have to order new ones and tell corporate what happened to each one '' 
 the mom kept pushing on the manager and the doors then yelled yall do n't yell at ma kids 
 they good yall evil 
 they just express themselves 
 yall evil and bad and we will yall managers '' 
 our manager in a smug voice says sure ma'am call corporate but we have so much evidence against your boys '' 
 one boy kept screaming over us i aint goin back to juvie '' 
 no way 
 aint going back to juvie 
 mama i aint going back '' 
 next morning we open up at 10 am and who 's the first customer - mama crazy 
 the store is quiet a lot of us had just pulled doubles and so everyone is tired and just waiting for the day to end 
 the same manager from the night before is there and she walks up to him huffing and puffing 
 lem me see those recliners 
 i do n't believe you 
 yall trying to put my boys in juvie and they all i have '' 
 my manager walks the woman to the warehouse and we follow 
 he shows her the photos of what her boys have done and then showed her the recliners lined up marked defective 
 how do i know you did n't pee on it 
 how do i know you did n't stage this because you do n't like ma kids 
 this is a witch hunt ma boys aint going to juvie yall got no proof 
 i love my boys '' 
 our manager walks her out and as she leaves he says we are pressing charges ma'am 
 we have every camera every photo and six associates who saw what happened 
 we 'll see you in court '' 
 as of today friday 25 january - the police arrested the three boys they pleaded not guilty and we 're going to court 
 background info 
 in the little rural city i live in there is a pretty common thing teenage <unk> 
 not saying it 's a bad thing because it is n't always 
 what i mean is we get lots and lots of them 
 mainly between the ages of 14 - 17. i 'm 18 and currently work in fashion retail it 's a mid - high end unique boutique only one of us 
 so there is no head office just the owner 
 i 'm at work the other day it 's been pretty slow so i 'm just wasting my time trying on clothes 
 i hear people so i quickly rush back to the counter where i see two former friends of mine 
 we lost contact when we were all 14 because they were getting into alcohol and drugs heavily and i was backing away i ended up moving town and so did one of the other girls 
 i moved back and i had no interest in trying to reconnect with any of them so i have n't 
 four years have past and now here they are standing in front me 
 let me paint a picture 
 both hair quite messy hair and thick makeup uggs quite worn looking leggings and plain shirts both with a toddler in a <unk> 
 they are t and s i am me & gt me : oh wow it 's been ages 
 how are you 
 & gt t : amazing 
 having a child has changed my life i feel so fulfilled now 
 i finally have something to do with myself & gt me : that 's wonderful & gt s : so how long have you been working here 
 never seen you here before & gt me : about 18 months now i think & gt s : aw 
 that 's so funny my little boy here is almost 18 months 
 it 's funny that thinking i could 've been wasting my time away in a shop all this <unk> & gt me : excuse me 
 & gt s : oh silly me of course 
 you have a baby at home right 
 & gt me : uh no.. & gt t : but you 're 18 
 you 're 18 and you still have n't had your first baby 
 <unk> & gt me : blankly stares at them in disbelief & gt s : you 've at least started trying right 
 your boyfriend wants kids too right 
 she actually looked concerned that i had n't started popping out kids yet & gt me : yeah we want kids in like 8 years maybe if we 're ready 
 who knows when all i know is not right now & gt t : engaged 
 & gt me : he turned 18 like 2 weeks ago so i do n't really think marriage is at the top of his priority list 
 or mine actually 
 we 've been together for more than a year but there 's no rush especially while we 're young & gt t : well good luck with <unk> if he 's not willing to commit now then i do n't see much hope for the <unk> word of advice though honey i 'd push to have those kids soon because otherwise you 're going to be stuck with the same nothing you have now & gt me : i have nothing 
 wrong i have a high school education and <unk> job with plenty of room of growth 
 i 'm not so insecure in my relationship i demand a ring in 6 months 
 if a guy wants to cheat a little metal band does n't stop anything 
 you however well 
 good luck living off one minimum wage paycheck for a few years until you can get a job 
 and then good luck getting a job when you have nothing past a year 9 education and no job experience 
 big smile that says fuck you stupid bitches '' they just looked at me in stunned silence for a few minutes then & gt t : well actually i get welfare money because i have a baby so that makes two paycheck bitch to my luck they then stormed out of the shop 
 yay 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven 
 **story : ** welcome to the week of scam artists 
 they rarely get away with it but that sure does n't stop them from trying 
 one of my cashiers was ringing up a large order when she flagged me down 
 she noticed that the price sticker on one of the items was wrong and wanted to let me know so we could fix it 
 we occasionally screw up once again i 'm talking about you josh and <unk> stuff 
 when we do we always sell it to the customer at the marked price since it was our fault 
 we 'll then go back and fix the mistake on any remaining inventory on the shelf 
 the item was a large mortar kit that <unk> for $ <unk> buy 1 get 1 free 
 the price tag on it said $ 49.95 so the female customer was definitely going to get a deal on our <unk> 
 i walked over to the shelf to check the price on the remaining products but they all seem to be ok so i went back to helping other customers 
 a minute later i get flagged down again for another price check 
 it 's another large item and it 's priced for less than half of what it normally sells for 
 i make a mental note to <unk> josh then go to check out the remaining items 
 once again they all seem to be priced correctly but i did notice that a different package on the shelf was totally missing a price tag 
 i grabbed a price gun and tagged the package missing a sticker 
 i barely finished putting a sticker on the item when i 'm flagged down again 
 now the customer starts fuming and berating my cashier about what screw ups we are 
 she really starts to raise hell so i apologize and tell her that we 'll take care of the issue 
 i also remind her that even though the items were mispriced we were giving them to her at the lower price 
 i go to check the item on the shelf and once again all of the remaining inventory seems to be priced right 
 now my spider sense is tingling 
 i walked back to the counter to <unk> the cashier ring in the rest of the items 
 amazingly i noticed that at all of the larger items that the woman has brought to the counter are mispriced 
 all of her large items no matter what the original price now have a price tag of $ 49.95 
 i stopped the transaction looked the lady in the eye and told her “i 'm not selling you anything and you need to leave <unk> 
 do you remember the scene from the movie <unk> exorcist” where father merrin <unk> von <unk> tries to <unk> the demon from reagan <unk> blair 
 the scene that unfolded at my tent was very similar to that but with less head spinning and more swearing 
 i’m in my <unk> and i honestly believe that i learned a few new words that day 
 she combined swear words and <unk> slurs that i’m fairly certain have never been used together before 
 she <unk> an amazing <unk> of obscenity <unk> occasionally by wild arm waving and the liberal use of her middle finger 
 i think she could have honestly set some type of world record but i apparently threw off her rhythm when i started <unk> her performance 
 i offered to call the police and have them sort it out but she was apparently <unk> and made a beeline for the door 
 the sad thing was she would have gotten away with it if she had just changed the price on one or two items 
 in retrospect i really need to train my staff better 
 my cashier actually did a great job in spotting the mispriced items but when i started to applaud the impressive display of obscenity none of my staff joined in 
 i’ll be adding that to our standard operating procedures <unk> before the upcoming new years eve 
 -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here short story english is not my first language blah blah 
 my friend has a private nail salon and always offers a very large box of <unk> candy on the table for customers 
 normally people eat one while they wait sometimes kids take two or three you can see where this is going ... so after she paid a middle aged lady asked are these free '' 
 to which my friend replied yes 
 the customer opens her purse and nonchalantly pours the *entire box* of chocolates in it 
 some of them fall down to the table she swipes them to the edge of the table and into her purse which is at this point filled to the brim with chocolates 
 she shakes my friends hand and happily walks off 
 ... the same lady wanted to know if there 's any way to stop her nails from growing for good since filing is work '' claiming the nail <unk> keep this a secret so they wo n't go out of <unk> dr - aerosol cheese ai n't for <unk> 
 just about 20 years ago i worked my first job at a local grocery 
 fun place to work generally a good group of kids my age 
 so i start in the pet food aisle and after the manager notices i can read the codes i get promoted '' to pasta where i rotate the stock 
 this leads to another promotion '' to cereal where i thwart a casual shoplifter with a well placed mouse glue trap 
 <unk> : he kept a pack of candy bars hidden behind some cereal i noticed it when i was rotating stock 
 asking how to handle it i was allowed to use my best judgement '' 
 the cops and the owner thought it was enough punishment to just pay for the rack of candy 
 i put promotion in quotes since it 's just more responsibility with no more money 
 so then just between the holidays i get promoted to dairy since the guy who did it before went on a long vacation 
 so my promotion '' to dairy came with a bonus - i got to call myself **the <unk> 
 so i notice that there is lots of damaged whipped cream in the back - i mean 2 cases 
 the red flag went up when i started the job and i was not doing said whiff-its 
 the manager we 'll call him the davestator gets really puzzled when the next shipment comes <unk> and we 're left with 2 extra cases 
 this is per week 
 davestator finally determines that the previous dairy guy we 'll call him pdg had been doing whiff-its in the cooler 
 at the time whipped cream cost about $ 2 a can so that was worth about 2 tanks of gas 
 every 
 friggin 
 week 
 it was n't my problem so i let it go 
 so pdg comes back with a tan and is put on cereal 
 whatever 
 a few days go by and someone is eating cheez whiz in the break room 
 i mention to pdg : hey did you ever think about how much more gas there is in that to move the cheez out 
 i mean it 's so much <unk> than whipped cream ya know '' 
 what happened next taught me more about the limits of human stupidity namely that there are none 
 about eight minutes after my aerosol cheese <unk> cream gas power <unk> i am coming out of the break room 
 i turn to see pdg spread eagle in the snack aisle 
 a half empty can of whiz is rolling away from him as he is coughing up yellow a <unk> <unk> rolling out his right <unk> 
 i did n't think he would actually try it 
 especially in the middle of the store 
 davestator is sitting in his observation cube up front trying very hard not to laugh 
 he <unk> himself having to blow his nose to clear the tears of <unk> and makes his way to the scene 
 davestator genuinely liked young adults so with a look of <unk> he stood over pdg and said : i am sure i do n't have to explain why you 're fired '' 
 he looks at me and i immediately say : i did n't think he would be dumb enough to try it 
 i was just joking '' 
 he just winked at me and told me to get the spill kit 
 thanks for listening i work in a big chain store in australia one of those stores that sell clothes *and* pet food *and* fishing gear *and* makeup ... all in one convenient location 
 you know the sort 
 i was working a long shift as door greeter a few weeks ago 
 we do basic loss prevention too but the <unk> i can go is checking people 's bags and stopping them if they set off our alarms when they leave 
 so the scene is set 
 enter stage left : a family unit - mother adult daughter and apparently <unk> father in full <unk> mode 
 as they walk into the store the dad sees me and shoots his arms up puts on a cheesy grin and yells strip search '' 
 his daughter fades carefully into the background as i shake my head at this guy 
 he puts on a pout and says aw you do n't wan na strip search me '' 
 before i know it the words spill out of my mouth ... nah only the attractive people '' 
 ... and then my brain kicked in 
 ohmygod what the fuck did i just say holy <unk> just as i was about to <unk> the dad <unk> with laughter slaps me on the back and promises to put on some pretty makeup for me on his way back out 
 it still took me a good ten minutes to get over my split-second panic attack ... hello tfr 
 this happened a few days back i work in a very well known pharmacy retail chain here in the states 
 it was a typical day except i was only doing a very short shift instead of a full 8 so i was full of spirit and pretty happy to be going home earlier for once 
 i was helping a very nice lady with her young 4 year old daughter 
 normally it 's the young ones that cause us problems but i digress 
 this happened word for word ... and i could n't be happier 
 starts off with the typical hello how are you lines and then it came to ringing up her stuff 
 some of the items were a bit out of sight for me since some of the items were <unk> and next thing you know the daughter starts grabbing the smaller items and handing them to me in the gentlest way ever 
 daughter : here you go mister 
 me : thanks 
 i did n't see those 
 still there were a few more items i still could n't see and there she was standing there and helping me 
 i 've never had a single kid before help us out normally they just chuck it at us or throw it in the basket for their parents to give it to us but nope this young girl was helping me out completely 
 me : thank you so much for the help 
 daughter : you 're welcome mister 
 i could n't resist gave the mom an in-store coupon of 5 bucks just to spend on her next time 
 sometimes ... the young ones really make the day better 
 <unk> in advance for any formatting issues* i was zoning late last night in the toy department when i heard the most dreaded <unk> the laughter of a small child as he began to play with all the talking action figures i had just fixed 
 i sighed and prepared myself for having to redo the aisles 
 after a bit i returned to see how bad it was.. only to see the father patiently standing behind his little boy showing him other neat toys he could choice from and cleaning up what little mess the child was making 
 eventually the little boy settled on a star <unk> <unk> vadar mask 
 just the cheap little face mask no lights or sound effects 
 his dad helped put in on and the little boy <unk> to march '' around the rest of the store all the while attempting to sing the <unk> march ... except he was so young all he could manage was repeatedly signing doo doo doo doo doo '' as he walked 
 dad picked it up though and hummed the rest of the song as they shopped 
 i laughed and the dad smiled and said the <unk> is strong in this one '' 
 anytime the little boy marched away his dad would say vadar come on down here '' 
 and he would return singing his little doo doo doo '' 
 i laugh that i do n't like children that much but little vadar was the cutest well behaved child i have ever seen 
 i work in a really high end designer 's evening gown boutique in a major city we 're talking dresses costing upwards of $ 1000 so i 'm guessing you can all predict the high maintenance types we come across on a daily basis but this one customer still stands out to me 
 she was a typical trophy wife who came armed with a superiority complex and a pair of heels 
 she wanted to try on everything in the store to <unk> what matched the shoes best 
 after trying on the a few dresses the assistant helping her noticed she 'd just dumped the dresses she 'd already tried on the ground and was standing on them in her heels 
 assuming the customer was just <unk> minded my coworker politely asked if she could pick up the dresses and <unk> them just to ensure they did n't get damaged reasonable request for a cool $ <unk> $ <unk> worth of dresses sitting on the ground right 
 this customer snapped at our staffer and during the rest of her stay continued to dump the rest of the dresses she tried on the ground and continued walking all over them in her heels 
 eventually our manager entered the change room and <unk> but still politely requested that she pick up the dresses on the floor to keep them from being pulled or damaged only to be called out as being rude by this customer i remember her saying something like you are so rude i respect my own clothes and for you to imply that i might damage one of your dresses is just unforgivable '' 
 after leaving the change room in a complete <unk> customer comes to the register with a white dress 
 i want this one but i 'll be needing a discount because it has a dirty footprint on it '' 
 at this point i 'm pretty sure my manager snapped because the customer is always right even when they are n't '' <unk> she always taught us just went out the window although she stayed deadly calm during this entire exchange : manager : i ca n't give you a discount because this is your footprint '' 
 customer : excuse me it is n't my footprint '' 
 manager : it is though i <unk> that dress this morning in our new stock delivery and it had no footprint on it and nobody had tried it on until you did '' customer she 's really irate now : how dare you say i damaged this dress 
 i 'm going to call our designer 's office about this 
 even if i did put the footprint on the dress it was still technically there before i bought it so i should n't have to pay full price 
 i 'm sure designer is going to be very interested to hear about your customer service '' 
 manager : feel free to call designer because i 'm sure she would tell you exactly what i 'm going to tell you now : our brand does n't need customers like you and we do n't want customers like you 
 good day '' 
 as my manager calmly walked off into the store and the rest of us <unk> our giggles the customer stood there for a second with a slack-jawed look before grabbing her <unk> designer purse and storming out 
 consequently she did call our designer 's office and not only did they agree 100 % with our manager 's actions they apparently also invited her to seek her future evening gowns from other labels '' 
 so great working for a company that <unk> us retail workers up when we get attacked by a <unk> was working the cash register at a drug store when <unk> guy rg came up to me with several packs of disposable razors and a handful of other items 
 i scanned everything and told him his total and he handed me coupons that made the razors free 
 i scan the coupons and tell him his total 
 now up to this point be was very pleasant 
 as soon as the total was out of my mouth he started flipping out 
 his face was red the veins were popping out of his neck and he gradually became louder and louder until he was screaming at me ... over 11 cents 
 rg : that is not my total 
 you over charged me 
 those razors should be free 
 me : they are free sir 
 rg : the total should be $ 0.11 less 
 you are ripping me off 
 me : sir the $ 0.11 is tax on the razors 
 the coupon states that you are still responsible to pay tax on the product 
 rg : you 're full of sh*t 
 they 're supposed to be <unk> 
 not 11 cents 
 <unk> free 
 get me your manager 
 now 
 i page for the manager and am forced to stare at this guy for 5 minutes while we wait 
 manager comes up and listens to rg scream at him about the few cents and tells him about the tax as well 
 they go back and forth for a few minutes before the manager takes a deep breath and asks do you want the stuff or not 
 because if you 're not going to buy it then you need to leave '' 
 rg : of course i want it 
 here tosses his debit card at manager who swipes it and hands him his receipt ... wait 
 you still charged me the 11 cents 
 that is robbery 
 i 'm calling your corporate office ... manager : turning his own shade of red reaches into the take a penny leave a penny '' cup pulls out 11 cents and slams it on the counter here 's your change sir 
 now get the hell out of my store 
 rg leaves and manager looks at me and says : that has got to be the cheapest <unk> i have ever met 
 tl dr : man loses his mind over $ 0.11 tax manager gives him change from take a penny leave a penny '' cup and throws him <unk> is my first time post in here so sorry if the formatting is off 
 anyways this happened a couple of nights ago 
 i work at a large grocery chain store 
 this happened on sunday night so it was slack and i was clearing excess cardboard off the shelves when this woman came over and asked me where the olive oil was 
 this wasnt unusual i get these type of questions all the time 
 the next part just got strange 
 i will call the woman cw crazy woman and myself <unk> <unk> working on my own task* & gt cw : do you know where the olive oil is 
 & gt m : yes its down aisle 10 at the other end 
 & gt cw : could you come with me and show me where it is exactly 
 & gt m : alright 
 *at this point it was slack so i didnt mind showing her where it was <unk> & gt m : alright here is where its at 
 & gt cw : can you hold it for me 
 i dont have enough arms 
 *this is where it got really <unk> & gt m : mam do you want me to get you a basket 
 & gt cw : <unk> i dont need a basket 
 i wont use it 
 *i walk to the front and get a basket from the front of the store 
 & gt m : here i got you a basket as it seems you need it 
 & gt cw : can you hold the basket i dont want to hold it 
 & gt m : <unk> ... ... *she then walks away and i put the basket down and go on about my work 
 & gt cw : i didnt say you could go <unk> i need you to carry my basket 
 & gt m : i have to get back to my work 
 & gt cw : but we still have to get the other things on my list 
 & gt m : look im not shopping for you 
 & gt cw : <unk> me a look* & gt m : oh i think someone needs some help in the back 
 i must go ill leave your basket right here 
 at this point i leave the basket on the floor and go around the corner to do something in the back 
 this was by far the weirdest experience ive ever had at any given point 
 i think once i gave her the basket she then thought i was going to do her shopping for her 
 now this person wasnt old or anything and seemed fine before this 
 but i will not become someones personal shopper for them.a few years ago i was working at an office supply store when an old lady comes in 
 she looks around a bit and then comes up to me and asks where we kept our <unk> 
 i lead her to where we keep them and she starts looking through them 
 her : wow $ 4.00 
 i could go to dollar tree and get one for a dollar '' 
 me : well you know you get what you pay for '' 
 her : you 're right 
 they probably have some titties on them or something 
 i was taken aback that something like that would come out of such a sweet old lady 's mouth but i just chuckled uncomfortably 
 so she picks out the <unk> she wants and says : her : where do you keep your pens 
 actually nevermind i 'll just go get those at the dollar tree 
 me : careful you might get some with some titties on them 
 she had a horrified look on her face and then responded : i said <unk> '' 
 much embarrassment and many apologies followed 
 tl dr i sexually harassed an old lady.a tale from a few years ago 
 i was the store manager at a supermarket 
 i was a really hot day over <unk> c. the store was air conditioned but there 's only so much it could do it was probably 30 when its normally kept at <unk> it was absolutely dead 
 mum comes in with kids grabs a <unk> of icecreams she opens the box to let the kids have one while their walking around which ticks me off in itself exception being to calm a baby or something which this is n't they do and grab a few drinks and some salads 
 she gets to the checkout and she <unk> that the icecreams she has been holding have started melting and have stained her <unk> white top 
 she comes up to the customer service counter i grab some paper towel and wipes and she spends a couple of minutes trying to blot out as much as possible we 're chatting and im playing concerned manager and all its seemingly all good 
 then when its obvious it was n't all coming out she gets snappy 
 & gt her : if this does n't come out you are buying me a new shirt this is brand new and cost me $ 80 
 & gt me : look i 'm sorry this happened ill do what i can to help you here i 'm even happy to get you a <unk> single serve stain remover type product but we wo n't be replacing the shirt.. & gt her : getting *really* aggressive and shouting oh yes you will 
 your store is too hot 
 it not fair 
 & gt me : staying calm i 'm sorry but you did n't use a basket and you opened the packet i suggest getting home and as quickly as possible ... at this point she cuts me off 
 shes not going home and is going out and whatever else she <unk> 
 she then takes off the top i 'm obviously telling her to stop 
 she does n't she rolls it up and slams it into my face saying & gt '' you <unk> removed clean it '' 
 so now i have a lady with a couple of young kids standing in front of me with just a bra on the top half 
 she was being <unk> and nothing i was doing <unk> with the standard retail face was <unk> the situation 
 & gt me - right that is not on 
 leave 
 now 
 she refuses so i call the police in front of her 
 & gt her - give me my shirt back 
 & gt me - will you leave 
 & gt her - no 
 you have to clean the shirt 
 & gt me - no 
 you just committed assault and i am keeping it to give to the police as evidence 
 you have to leave 
 now 
 the police rock up pretty quickly 
 they ring the dad to come down and get the kids its suggested to him to walk down or get dropped down so he can take the car as she 's likely to be arrested 
 dad comes down gets briefed by the police grabs the kids and leaves 
 so police ask me what i want to do 
 i serve the standard barring notice on her and ask me what i want to do with regards to pressing charges 
 i say that i 'm happy to leave it if she 's calm and the police do n't want to do the paperwork 
 police tell the woman that shes not being charged today but being fined for something else and the shirt is being taken pending a decision on the assault question and shes free to go for now type thing 
 she rings her husband who presumably mortified by the situation refuses and tells her to make her own way home 
 cops refuse to give her a lift says that the bra is as much coverage as is needed and shes not committing indecent <unk> and does n't live that far away 
 she had to walk home in her bra and shorts 
 clear across the small country town 
 i never got a call to go to court so i do n't think the police <unk> <unk> i am working the register and answering the phone at bigchaingrocery 
 hello thank you for calling bigchaingrocery this is rusty how may i help you 
 lady : <unk> ... <unk> ... i was there a few days ago and i got ice cream and there aint none in tha house 
 me : ... lady : maybe i left it on the checkout 
 she is practically shouting at this point me : well its certainly possible 
 do you have your receipt 
 lady : yall gon na replace my damn <unk> 
 my store is very big on give the customer whatever they want as long as the leave happy 
 whatever 
 i make <unk> wage 
 i dont get paid enough to care me : sure maam just bring in your receipt and well replace it for you lady : well hold on lem me find the damn thing 
 cue loud rummaging 
 apparently she finds it and starts reading off her items one by one 
 its a long list 
 finally she <unk> and suprise she never had any ice cream 
 lady : now what about my ice cream 
 me : maam ... you didnt buy any ice cream 
 lady : what you mean i aint buy no damn ice cream 
 me : ... ..you didnt read off ice cream on your receipt 
 lady : i didnt 
 me : ... .. the lady starts reading off her <unk> again 
 i just zone out 
 lady : fuck 
 hangs up me : i can help the next person on register 1. closer to the end of my shift today a family came into the store 
 it was a mom dad and two daughters probably around 8 and <unk> they browsed for a bit and every once in a while i would listen in 
 the mom kept asking the daughters if they had enough money for what they were buying and the girls would think it over and answer 
 when they picked out the items they wanted to buy two disney infinity characters and a game and my coworker told them their total the mom turned to the oldest daughter 
 you 're paying for these with your birthday money 
 do you remember how much money you have '' 
 when the daughter shook her head the mom pulled out her money and slowly counted it with her daughter letting the daughter add up the 20 dollar bills 
 when the girl had decided she had $ 80 my coworker reminded her that she owed $ 65 
 the mom asked her if she had enough money to pay for her new toys 
 the daughter replied yes really <unk> and her mom encouraged her to be confident in her answer 
 so the daughter handed the money to my coworker who rang up the transaction gave her the change and helped her count it out 
 the daughter thanked us and began to leave carrying the bag but the mom stayed behind to thank us 
 she was trying to help her daughter understand the concept of money and its value and at other places cashiers would get impatient with how long it took the daughter to count her money and decide if it was enough 
 it may seem very insignificant but examples of good parenting coming into my store are few and far between and i thought i 'd share with you all.a woman we shall call bbb barbarian book buyer came into my used bookstore browsing and chatting 
 it seemed pleasant enough at first 
 bbb pulled out a book and said oh what a lovely inscription '' 
 she read it aloud 
 someone had written on the fly leaf a sweet poem 
 she liked it so much she read it out loud again 
 bbb said i want this '' 
 i thought she meant that she wanted the book but no she just wanted the poem 
 she started to tear the page out 
 whoa '' 
 i yelled 
 you ca n't just tear pages out of a book '' 
 bbb : what 's the problem 
 it 's just a blank page 
 who cares '' 
 me : i care 
 if you want the poem you can buy the book '' 
 bbb : i 'm not buying a book just for one page '' 
 me : well you 're certainly not tearing a page out of any of my books without paying for it 
 if you buy it you can set it on fire 
 until then please do n't destroy the books 
 but then the book is only three dollars '' 
 bbb : fine 
 i 'll buy it '' 
 she put the book on the counter and proceeds to tear the page 
 me : i must insist that you pay for the book first before you destroy it '' 
 bbb : huh 
 i said i was going to pay for it 
 did you think i would n't '' 
 me : ma'am you 're in a bookstore about to rip pages out of a book 
 i think you could be capable of anything '' 
 bbb : you 're kind of a bitch are n't you '' 
 me incredulous but not giving ground : you have no idea of how much of a bitch i am '' 
 bbb : fine '' 
 she slapped a five down on the counter 
 i gave her change 
 me : okay now you can tear the book up to your heart 's content ... although it 's still painful to watch '' 
 bbb : god 
 you are a real piece of work 
 so ... are you hiring '' 
 tl/dr : customer wants to tear out a page from a book calls me a name then asks me for a job 
 so i was a cashier working at a major grocery store chain 
 often we have deals with items that are buy one get one free 
 so anyways onto the story 
 i was working as a cashier one night and this lady came up with nothing but items that were bogo buy one get one 
 i always try to strike up conversation with customers to make the time go by so i mention how many good deals she 's getting as i scan the items 
 she looks at me and proudly states oh i 'm going take all of these groceries to one of your competitors to get store credit there 
 i do it all the time and they do n't seem to mind 
 i 've saved so much money doing this '' 
 i looked at her in confusion 
 she was buying things at our store for 50 % off and taking them to a competitor to get a store credit for 100 % of their value per item 
 i rang her out but i did n't say anything after that 
 i wanted to tell her off for committing fraud and wasting food but i valued my <unk> happened about 5 years ago and popped into my head after reading one of the top threads <unk> on here 
 i 'm an it engineer by trade and do a lot of travelling and <unk> work with customers so by policy it 's nice shirts a tie and shiny shoes on a daily basis that regularly end up covered in dust 
 i was out doing some work for a local insurance company faulty server nothing major and got kicked out over lunch hour so i went to their local big brand store to grab a bite to eat 
 i wo n't name names 
 so there i am <unk> into the store wondering what <unk> treats await me in the hot food section when i 'm stopped in my tracks by an older man in a suit 
 steps in front of me arms crossed face like <unk> 
 looks vaguely like jack <unk> 
 asks me what i 'm doing 
 i look confused and have no idea how to respond 
 guess i probably looked at him like he was mental 
 he follows up with & gt you were supposed to be here at 9am 
 this is unacceptable 
 my office 
 now 
 & gt me : sorry what 
 & gt you were supposed to be here at 9am 
 when i request management cover from another store i expect you on time not when it suits you 
 & gt me : yeah i think you 've mistaken me for someone else sorry 
 & gt ryan let me put it this way 
 my office or you wo n't have a job tomorrow 
 & gt me : that 's not my name i do n't work here 
 i think you 've mistaken me for ... then his actions interrupt me he pulls a face - obviously not believing me 
 he gets as close as he can to me physically close enough for a good manly hug then he attempts to herd me towards the door behind him marked staff only '' waving his arms towards me at waist level like he was trying to <unk> a fart in my face 
 i also do some teaching part-time at a local college it courses of course so at this point i figure my best line of action is to use angry teacher voice^tm 
 & gt me : right i do n't know who you think i am but i do n't work here 
 and fuck sake get out of my face 
 it causes him to pause 
 he 's obviously catching on that someone junior to him is unlikely to swear at him 
 i can see him staring at my chest i 'm male 
 get your mind out of the gutter 
 of course 
 i 'm wearing the same colored lanyard as his store employees 
 just like he is 
 and i 'm in a suit 
 i probably look like management 
 it dawns on him that he might be wrong and notices the logo on the lanyard is most definitely *not* that of his store 
 what does he do 
 turns bright red and just walks away 
 does n't 
 say 
 a. word 
 one of their employees was watching this whole thing and burst out laughing 
 he came up to me and we had a brief friendly chat 
 apparently it was one of the junior regional managers that had just <unk> me 
 laughs were had i got my delicious cumberland sausage and noticed my receipt was missing about half the items 
 the same employee i 'd had a laugh with had been on checkout 
 guess i got a cheap lunch for keeping someone entertained 
 definitely a very odd encounter 
 i have n't been back in that part of the country since or in the same store 
 i wonder if tales are still told of the sharply dressed man that told the regional manager to get the fuck out of his face seriously who goes to a department store at 5:30 on a friday and thinks it would n't be packed 
 i was on registers last night because they take me off men 's all the time cause im amazing at getting people to apply for charge cards 
 i have a line of five people and im helping them as <unk> as always until this old woman gets in line and within two minutes yells you know some of us have places to go '' 
 she proceeded to scoff loudly and stamp her legs for a whole three minutes before the amazing people in line just laid into her and <unk> her to be next 
 it was beautiful 
 oh shit it 's the center of the <unk> 
 i did n't realize '' 
 oh you can go next you seem a bit unstable '' 
 god i hope no one else has to deal with you today just go first '' 
 my customers all made her feel so bad her head was shrugged in shame and she barely spoke while she bought her $ 24 pajamas 
 i gave everyone in that line 20 % off 
 i 'm allowed to give discounts to my discretion and they all earned it for standing up for me.on mobile so sorry for any errors 
 this happened around 10 years ago in my retail slave <unk> we were prepping for our end of season sale 
 our sale was huge 
 the entire store is in the sale 
 it takes a lot of preparation 
 all the full price stock is taken down and replaced with sale stock or marked down 
 we have to hang <unk> and other signage the windows are dressed for sale all the fixtures are changed around or removed 
 it 's an all hands on deck kinda thing 
 in the day before the sale we close early around 6pm instead of the usual 9pm 
 the window has a huge <unk> sticker announcing that we are closed and the glass doors are blacked out with <unk> paper 
 our store was in a shopping centre and we had an overflow stockroom at the other end of the centre 
 for this reason we had to keep the doors unlocked 
 closed but unlocked to allow ease of movement for staff bringing stuff to and from the overflow stockroom 
 anywho we 're all working away around 20 of us 
 a customer opens the door and strolls in not noticing the empty racks boxes piled high staff members sitting on the ground marking stuff down one of the girls turns around and tells her that we 're closed 
 the customer leaves 
 this happened again and again and again 
 each time a staff member tells the oblivious customer that were closed 
 after about the twentieth person walking in we all looked at the door and shouted we 're closed completely in <unk> 
 the customer slowly backed out the door with a look if utter fear on her face 
 it was fucking hilarious.top post in this sub after one day 
 i need new pants 
 ___ everyone has had a co-worker like this someone who is disrespectful to the bosses and who snaps at the customers 
 one of my bosses is asian yet born and raised in america and she is incredibly nice 
 one day db foolishly decided to <unk> her because of her race in front of at least 10 customers while simultaneously not getting their food 
 <unk> <unk> 
 anyway i got a text from db the following sunday asking if i can give him a ride to work as he missed the bus db told me if he does n't come in they were going to fire him 
 db getting fired sounds petty good to me so i told him i ca n't give him a ride 
 when i got to work later that day i saw db sitting in the lobby while my store manager is talking to him turns out he found a way to work and they fired him anyway 
 i later found out they only scheduled him to fire him 
 he was on for three hours <unk> on monday and he did n't see anything weird with it 
 the asian manager just wanted to see his face when he found out so they had him come in 
 the store manager being the nice person he is gave him $ 3 for the bus which douche <unk> promptly used to buy a lottery ticket if he lost he 'd have to walk miles home in the winter 
 he luckily won $ 20 yet used it to buy alcohol and get drunk in the lobby 
 our asian manager happily kicked his ass out he had no ride home 
 i also got a text from him a few weeks ago asking me for money i did n't respond 
 reddit what are some stories about you getting fired or witnessing someone being fired story the third from london 's hardest working revenue protection officer ... ^ subject to discussion time : 22:18 central line 
 on the way home wearing uniform a lady gets on at bond street station and once the doors close she squats near the door 
 i think nothing of it until i hear her tights rip 
 i look over 
 that bitch 
 she 's changing her tampon on a train 
 me : excuse me madam lady : just one second me : no not one second lady : well what 's the <unk> issue 
 me : public indecency creating a biohazard general obscenity lady : it 's only a tampon me : i 'm gon na need to ask you to step off the train and use the station toilets if you wish to do that lady : no need i 've changed it this bitch then proceeds to hand me her blood covered tampon no amount of bleach managed to clean my hands ... tldr : girl gets caught red handed hands the evidence over to me.i 'm a sales associate at a outlet shoe store that 's recently gained a lot more traffic ever since a video <unk> our brands shoes we all know where i 'm going with this went viral 
 the way our store is set up we have 2 rows of full price shoes stacked in closed boxes on shelves organized by shoe type at the very front of the store then the rest of the store are rows of open boxes of sale shoes organized by size instead 
 in this story the messy shoe box lady '' is who we will refer to as msbl 
 the difference between the sale shoes and the full price shoes is very obvious which comes in handy when explaining what shoes are included in our buy one sale shoe get a second sale shoe half off '' sale we always have 
 it 's literally 2 shelves not on sale in the entire store 
 fast forward to last night - it 's around 7:30 we close the store at 9 and it was pretty quiet 
 i started slowly tidying the rows of the sale shoes - since they 're open boxes with the shoes on display they oftentimes can get messy quickly and putting all the boxes back in order can be pretty time <unk> 
 while i 'm working a woman is looking at the shoes beside me taking a bunch of pairs out of their boxes which she 's leaving on the wall still tried them on decides she does n't like them and then throws the shoes somewhere random instead of putting them back in their box 
 this can kind of be a nightmare for us because not only do we need the barcode on the box should you choose to buy the shoes but hunting the shoe box down in a full store to put the shoes back if you do n't buy them can get overwhelming 
 but regardless it 's part of my job to clean up so i keep quiet 
 i got distracted with a customer who asked for my help and when i came back i noticed the msbl looking at the <unk> shoes and asked if she needed help 
 she then asked if they were included in the sale and when i told her it was only the <unk> shoes in the open boxes she huffed and puffed away 
 a few minutes later she came up to my cash and this happened : msbl : ***walks up with 2 pairs of shoes sans <unk> hello i 'd like to purchase these two pairs of shoes 
 me : awesome 
 i do need to scan the barcode on the shoe boxes though 
 would you be able to grab those for me please 
 msbl : these shoes did n't have a box 
 they were just laying on the shelf 
 <unk> is bull 
 every single pair of shoes in our store has a matching box 
 we do checks throughout the day to make sure and i was literally just cleaning the racks like i said 
 *** me : unfortunately i ca n't process the shoe purchase without the barcode i do need the box 
 msbl : i do n't know why you 're being so difficult 
 i 'll go find some boxes i suppose 
 <unk> away for a few minutes and comes back with two boxes both of which do n't match up to the shoes and are priced at 19.95 our most reduced price for any of our <unk> me : hey i do n't mean to make this process take so long but these two boxes do n't seem to match up with the shoes inside 
 let me try and locate a box for these shoes so we can make this move a bit faster 
 at this point i decide to take a closer look at the shoes and see if i can figure out what kind they are 
 after a year or so working with 10000 different styles of shoes you somehow quickly learn the random and obscure shoe names 
 thankfully it only took me a whopping 5 seconds to realize these are our two classic shoes which are full price which never go on sale which are currently <unk> for 80 dollars a pair 
 shocking 
 me : these two are actually full price shoes that do not go on sale they currently cost 80 dollars and the sale would not apply to them 
 did you still want to purchase them 
 msbl : this is ridiculous 
 i found them in these two boxes and you need to honour it 
 get me your manager 
 you have terrible customer service skills 
 keep in mind my manager is a badass who always sticks up for us 
 i was so stoked she asked me to call him over 
 little did i know he was listening to the whole time and <unk> for the situation 
 manager : ***walks over with the corresponding full price shoe boxes inside of which contain the two cheaper shoes she obviously swapped boxes with when no one was <unk> i do apologize but i have to stand behind my employee on this one as it looks as though the shoes were swapped 
 we 're unable to honour an incorrect box price when it is obvious someone has <unk> switched boxes 
 she got so nervous and i have never seen a woman run out faster of the store in my entire <unk> tale from my overpriced ice cream shop 
 so this young mother comes in with her two children both adorable and under the age of <unk> i 'm already thinking that they 're one of the cutest family sets i 've ever seen when they open their mouth and the <unk> english accent i 've ever heard comes out i live in america 's bible belt 
 english accents are rare 
 so my head just about exploded 
 the kids are looking at the candies we offer as <unk> and keep asking their mom if we have a certain kind of candy that i have never heard of before so i 'll assume it 's <unk> 
 mom tells them to ask me i tell them that unfortunately we do not offer that kind of candy 
 their faces absolutely fall 
 they look like human versions of the : emoticon 
 i feel awful 
 so the kids keep looking at the mix-in options we have 
 suddenly the boy child looks as if he has seen the face of god 
 full-on :0 '' emoticon 
 he then yells in his childhood squeak of an english accent : & gt mummy 
 they have gummy bears 
 america still has gummy bears 
 mummy 
 gummy bears 
 he proceeded to order cotton candy ice cream with extra gummy bears 
 i have never seen a cuter nor a more excited reaction to gummy bears.so i run my own store 
 photo studio where we photograph people they select what photo 's they want prints digital canvas mugs on wood <unk> 
 had a customer in yesterday who started complaining about the photo paper not the photo the paper being of bad quality and she wanted her money back 
 now i know my paper i print on the best <unk> paper i can get my hands on 
 there simply is no way in the world that the quality is bad 
 it <unk> a bath in <unk> <unk> 
 wipe it off with a cleaning agent 
 possible 
 colours do n't <unk> like they used to difficult to tear up the whole nine yards 
 so after hearing her tirade and responding she was gave up 
 threw out one last remark : i 'm going to give you a bad review and i 'm gon na make sure you get fired 
 my retort 
 like hell you are i own this place 
 goodbye 
 angry customer 0 - me 1 tl dr : the magical retail fairy brought me a present i work at a bridal store 
 <unk> are a <unk> those are some fun stories but the moms can get pretty bad 
 yesterday a bride and her mother come in to try on some wedding gowns 
 as they were looking through the store they spot the seamstress in the back of store pressing and steaming someone else 's wedding gown 
 now there is a doorway and a curtain <unk> the front of the store from the back where the main office is and where the <unk> do their work 
 it 's pretty clear only employees are allowed back there 
 but no the mother just strolls back there picks up the train of the dress while the seamstress is working on it and says oh honey look at this one 
 this is gorgeous you need to try it on '' 
 i promptly hurry back there because 1. that 's an area she should not be in and 2. i really did not want her touching someone else 's dress 
 i tell her that it is indeed someone else 's dress her daughter can not try that specific dress on but i will gladly look in our inventory to see if we still have the gown 
 she seemed confused but made her way back to the front of the store 
 i look it up and turns out we do n't have that dress as a sample because it came through a trunk show which i tell her and then proceed to suggest similar styles we do have in stock 
 while the daughter accepted this fact the mother got a bit hostile 
 mom : so if you do n't have it let her try that one in the back on 
 me : i 'm sorry but i ca n't 
 this is someone else 's wedding gown that was specifically ordered for her 
 mom : so 
 me : ... so this is her dress not a sample 
 we make a promise to our customers that their dresses will be safe and treated right 
 mom : just let her slip it on she 'll be extra careful 
 me : ma'am this woman 's wedding is this weekend the seamstress is already half way through pressing it your daughter will not be trying this dress on 
 daughter : mom let it go i have enough dresses to try 
 mom huffs off to look for even more gowns and my coworker and i exchange wide eye glances 
 then while her daughter is in the middle of trying dresses she goes back there again and says well look at this one dear this dress has this and this and this and that dress does n't 
 i still think you should try this on '' 
 at this point i get a little rude 
 ma'am i apologize but you can not go to the backroom and <unk> with the seamstress while she is working 
 your daughter will not be trying that dress on and that is final '' 
 she again huffs off back to her seat and sits there until they leave at which point my coworker and i burst out laughing at that ridiculous woman 
 i know it 's not even remotely as bad as what some of you guys get but like come on lady use common sense 
 edit : well this is a cool response you guys are hilarious 
 i have a real <unk> of a story i 'll be posting tomorrow of a slightly crazy <unk> since you guys want more stories 
 thanks tfr 
 note : using a throwaway as my boss uses reddit and knows my <unk> 
 so i barista at a small cafe five hours a day five days a week 
 it 's a great job with great hours for my college schedule and the customers are generally fantastic 
 in fact in the 8 months or so i 've been on the job i 've only dealt with a small handful of rude customers 
 this lady from about 2 weeks ago was one of those people and her comment still <unk> me today 
 before i continue i must explain how our pos system works 
 we use something called square which uses the ipad for processing credit/debit cards 
 it 's really neat and comes with a lot of features like a <unk> tool that forces non-tippers to select no tip '' before they can sign their names on another screen to authorize the sale 
 most people do n't mind this and think it 's neat and it really <unk> our tips 
 except clueless 
 clueless thinks she 's being forced to tip not noticing the no tip '' option and proceeds to yell at me and berate me 
 brief conversation with her : clueless - the f -- k is this 
 i have to leave a tip for some high school dropout 
 cancel the order 
 cancel everything 
 i 'm never coming here again 
 this is <unk> '' 
 me - ma'am there 's an option below the dollar amounts you see that allows you to process the transaction without <unk> a tip 
 here -proceeds to help her find it- '' clueless - oh i see now 
 you 're trying to make me feel like a bad person 
 well it has n't worked <unk> 
 i do n't believe in <unk> high school <unk> who refuse to get some education and a real job 
 i have n't tipped anyone in at least ten years '' 
 me - okay ... did you still want to cancel the order '' 
 clueless - absolutely 
 and give me back my credit card '' 
 she leaves in a rage 
 i wish her a good day and she tells me she 's going to have a bad one just to spite me <unk> 
 i hate people 
 **background** – i worked in an electronic / <unk> store 
 the kind of store you would go when you need a button a switch a board and wires for your project or your kid’s school projects 
 i used to be a customer there before i got hired as a part time while i was in school 
 i liked the job 
 i was assigned to the computer department we did not sell or repair computers we would sell accessories and a lot of routers 
 at the time of this story it was my first few months working there 
 **story** – one day on my day off i went there to buy <unk> wires and few cables to wire my sound system and plug my computer to the tv / sound system 
 i had the idea in the morning and genius me decided to go buy them now 
 so i was there minding my ~~busyness~~ business when enters sc stupid customer 
 he was a regular which came every one or 2 weeks and bought a lot of computer accessories and other things in the store 
 i was far from the department i would work but he still recognized me without my official uniform 
 **sc** – hey you 
 *now since it was crowded i did not give a damn 
 people try to get the attention on the floor staff all the time 
 * **sc** – i’m talking to you 
 *at this point i turn around as did many people 
 * **sc** – are you going to help me or what 
 while pointing at me **me** - *points at <unk> me 
 i am not working today sir i am actually shopping just like you 
 you can ask any other employee that has their uniform on and they will gladly help you 
 *sc didn’t like that at <unk> **sc** – no you are going to help me or i will fill a complaint 
 i have no time to find another person and it is too crowded 
 so tell me where i could find * brand and gauge of speaker wire * **me** – sir even if i would be working right now i do not know anything about this 
 you would need to ask someone in the <unk> department 
 *sc is staring me down 
 at this point i know what is coming next so i turn around and ask an employee behind a counter to call the manager 
 it literally went that way 
 * **me** to employee – can you please call the <unk> **sc** – get me your fu**ing manager 
 so that basically ruined my morning 
 i was getting shit from a customer when i was not even working 
 if i would have known where his item was i would have told him at least… but i didn’t 
 the manager came and saw me 
 let’s call him stm for store manager 
 **stm** – what can i do for you 
 **sc** – your useless employee doesn’t want to help me 
 i want to file a complaint 
 **stm** – are you working today <unk> 
 **me** – no i am not 
 **stm** to sc – so why are you asking <unk> to help you when he doesn’t have his uniform on 
 there are employees on the floor that will gladly help you 
 sc is now firing <unk> out of his eyes and probably about to shit a <unk> bomb at this point 
 **sc** – i don’t fu**ing care he has to help he works here now where do i file a damn complaint 
 stm and i were just shocked 
 then he went to the service desk to make sc file a complaint 
 once the complaint was filled stm took the form and shredded it in from of him 
 i was too far to hear anything 
 but seeing that just made my day beautiful again 
 **tl dr** : <unk> from <unk> came in to shop when suddenly confetti and <unk> 
 edit : typing is hard and serious ~~busyness~~ business 
 manly tear edit : woah thanks for the tfr quote of the day highlight 
 : di was working at a relatively small convenience store in a village 
 it was around 3:30pm so the kids had finished school and were coming home on the bus 
 this was usually a very busy time as the bus stop was opposite the shop so a lot of them came into the shop with a few pounds in change and bought <unk> drinks etc 
 no real problem there - in fact i enjoyed serving them as they were clearly looking forward to their <unk> goodness after a day at school 
 anyway i serve some kid a <unk> energy drink 
 it was quite popular since my company stocked a <unk> <unk> version instead of the non-pmp version that the supermarkets sold for <unk> 
 the kid was around thirteen it turns out but looked <unk> 
 he leaves happy 
 five minutes later the boy 's mother comes in furious at me 
 how dare you serve this energy drink to my son '' she says 
 it 's against the law - it 's not for children 
 i explain that i 'm sorry to have served her son and that while company policy says that i should serve everyone if they have the right money and there is n't a law against serving them ie alcohol tobacco lottery etc i 'm sure that a written letter asking us not to serve her son again would prevent any repeat of this 
 she was n't having it 
 she was demanding a refund - not going to happen 
 the drink was <unk> and if i processed a refund i 'd get a formal warning from management for going against refund policy 
 obviously i did n't tell her this as she would n't care if i received a warning she wanted me fired anyway so i begrudgingly gave her £1 of my own money thinking that would be that 
 nope 
 turns out that she had phoned the police saying that a shop had served an underage customer something illegal '' 
 the police arrived about fifteen minutes later probably because if i had served the child alcohol i 'd get prosecuted and face a £2,500 fine and criminal record and the shop could lose its premises licence - so quite serious 
 the police officer spoke to the woman asking her to explain what happened 
 he looked a little confused 
 i explained that the company did n't have a policy against selling energy drinks to kids that i was sorry to have caused offence and that the matter could be dealt with by the store manager - who by this point had got back from her <unk> cigarette break ... the police officer gave the worst death-stare to the woman for wasting his time and told us that we should <unk> from serving her son energy drinks 
 after one hour of wasted time and a police <unk> she gave up on her quest to get me fired and left 
 tl dr : woman sees her son is served an energy drink 
 phones police before confronting me 
 police pissed off at wasted time 
 edit : it 's rare that i do this but thanks for the internet points 
 it 's really brightened my day to know that there are people who understand my point of view have experience in a similar situation or at least think that the woman was an idiot 
 thanks 
 : i 'd been recently promoted to a <unk> management position at a big red office supply store 
 my boss called and had a personal issue and asked if i minded if she was an hour or so late 
 not at all 
 we had an older gentleman over at our print center - he had a very nasty cough 
 poor man at one point his cough was too much for his bowels and he ran for the back of the store dripping things that should n't be <unk> behind him 
 his efforts to clean himself quite thoroughly rendered our men 's restroom inoperable ... the floor the walls the sink ... everything covered in <unk> 
 i intended to clean it up - i could n't ask my staff to do it 
 but k one of my amazing associates grabbed the <unk> suit and a bucket and took care of everything 
 i sent my <unk> boss a text message : old dude shot himself 
 do n't worry k cleaned it up 
 she deserves a raise '' 
 whoops 
 another quick text 
 shit 
 not shot 
 i 'm so sorry 
 he shit himself 
 everything is fine now '' 
 she told me later that she was sure she was fired at that point 
 because really if you 're the boss and you 're late for work and there 's brain matter all over your store ... you 're just done 
 we 've had several levels of management across the company laughing at my terrible autocorrect 
 i told my boss that this would go down in the <unk> of history 
 he said i was the only person he knew who could make a pun out of the word anal ... i had n't even planned it that <unk> is a tale from long ago at my first retail job 
 i was 20 at the time of our tale 
 working in a somewhat expensive store though we had a clearance section with all kinds of old discontinued odds and ends that were dirt cheap 
 i was a cashier our store had a mailing list like many stores and if you were on it they would mail you coupons 
 pretty decent ones too 
 so i 'm ringing up a customer and she pulls out her mailing list coupon for 50 % off any one regularly priced item that 's important to note 
 i scan the coupon put it in my drawer and wish her a good day 
 crazy lady cl mid to late 40 's dressed nicely carrying an expensive bag comes up next with some $ 2 item found in the bowels of clearance 
 me : did you find every thing okay today 
 & gt cl : i want a coupon 
 me : i beg your pardon 
 & gt cl : i want a coupon like the last lady just used 
 me : cheerfully oh well if you sign up for our mailing list we 'll send you plenty of great coupons 
 & gt cl : no ... i want that coupon and i want it now 
 me : oh ... uhm ... i 'm sorry i do n't have any of those coupons they 're sent from corporate and i ca n't <unk> that one 
 also it 's in my drawer and i have no access to it 
 & gt cl : now screaming this is outrageous 
 i want that coupon and i want it now 
 i 'll have you fired for this i 'll have everyone here fired for this 
 how do you have a job treating customers so rudely 
 i wave over my manager ma and explain the issue 
 ma : ma'am we do n't have any coupons in the store also that coupon was for a regularly priced item you would n't be able to use it on your purchase 
 & gt cl : still screaming this is the worst customer service i 've ever received i 'll see to it that this dump goes out of business 
 i 'm going to call corporate you 'll regret treating me like this 
 ma : i 'm really sorry you 're upset i can give you our senior discount on the item it 's for 10 % off if that will help 
 & gt cl : yes okay fine 
 she then turns to me with this smug look of satisfaction and says see 
 i always get my way '' 
 yep ... you sure showed me lady making an ass out of yourself and berating a person young enough to be your kid all to save 20 cents ... <unk> go you 
 i did n't say that or anything i just stared at her like the fucking lunatic she was while she walked out of the store and got into her overpriced luxury suv 
 i can not figure out the mentality behind freaking out over 20 cents to this day 
 hello tfr 
 i have yet another tale from the glorious parking facility 
 the events that occurred were just beautiful in every possible way 
 tonight there 's a country concert quite a mix of people 
 some small some big some young some old 
 in comes bumpkin a rather large woman and her <unk> 
 me : good afternoon 
 its 25 to park ma'am 
 bumpkin : yeah i hurt my leg 
 can i park down here 
 me : unfortunately i ca n't let you park on the lower level most of these spaces are already reserved and we keep them open for handicapped and elderly 
 bumpkin : but my legs really killing me i 'll give you an extra 5. me : no thank you ma'am 
 now she never once showed me a placard so i sent her upstairs 
 she did n't have one 
 in comes the sweetest little <unk> woman i have ever seen with her elderly mother 
 like this woman had sugar for blood she was so kind 
 cherub : hello <unk> 
 would it be possible to get a close spot my mommy lol has a walker and she 's a bit passed her <unk> 
 to which the passenger rolls her eyes and laughs 
 she has a placard though so i let them park next to me 
 well bumpkin is already downstairs while this is going on and she 's watching and as soon as i move the cone and cherub pulls in she starts walking up to me calling out 
 bumpkin : what the hell 
 i told you i was in pain how is this fair 
 wtf 
 i have a thyroid issue and i 'm on the dang roof 
 me : ma'am they have a placard 
 bumpkin : and 
 i have a thyroid issue 
 i want my money back 
 me : if you would like to leave i 'll give you you 're money back 
 unfortunately i 'm not going to refund you if you stay here 
 now while this is going on the elderly woman is out of her car looking at us 
 she 's moving with her walker 
 bumpkin : i have a disability 
 this is ridiculous 
 without a pause the old woman <unk> with the sweetest old lady voice ever 
 grandma : sweety being fat is n't a disability 
 and she winked at me i 'm a big dude myself apparently bumpkin was at a loss for words because she did n't say *anything* and walked away 
 i 'm could n't keep a straight face 
 i still ca n't 
 i 'm smiling my butt off as i share this with you all 
 edit : i understand thyroid issues are legitimate 
 but i 'm sure this is just a fat lady using it as an excuse for being fat 
 also for people that <unk> me saying i was fat <unk> i 'm <unk> '' 375lbs 
 i can still walk run and see everything below my waist 
 there 's no excuse.that 's the story 
 that 's the whole story 
 couple hours later my manager asks if i helped someone get thing and i told him yeah and he said that they called and complained about how i tried to sell them something they did n't ask for '' 
 i offered them ... the same thing ... at a lower price 
 <unk> they called and left a complaint about me 
 ** edit : i edited out the conversation because it was short yet <unk> and i got a little paranoid 
 the story does n't lose anything from it 
 sorry 
 this occurred at a store that involves colored shirts 
 i was working a summer job there mostly <unk> the in-store credit card but also doing cashier stuff when there was a crush 
 the instructions for the sale of alcohol were as follows * scan their id * enter their birth date into the field that pops up on the computer this was the <unk> of the instructions 
 an elderly lady comes in clearly old enough to be my grandmother and like an obedient minimum wage employee i ask for her id 
 she gets quite mad at me demanding to know why i want to see her id not accepting the reason i give and then repeating the demand 
 eventually i call for help from the head cashier '' who apologizes for my being new '' and finishes the transaction 
 then they tell me that you can press <unk> to <unk> the age verification screen if someone is clearly old enough that you do n't need to check their <unk> i walk through the valley of the <unk> of boxes ... hey 
 you 
 <unk> 
 can i get some help over here '' 
 & gt <unk> lord i was about to take my break* yes 
 this bin is empty '' 
 she says pointing to an empty bin 
 *how perceptive* i need what 's in that bin '' 
 & gt ma'am that bin is always empty 
 we do n't stock any products in that bin 
 what 
 yes you do 
 it says so right here '' she shouts waving a sales paper in my face and snatching it right back 
 & gt may i see that for a second ma'am 
 she obliges to my relief 
 & gt <unk> the <unk> here 's the issue ma'am 
 this is aisle 2 bin 30. you want aisle 30 bin 2 
 *i can take my break* ... that 's not what this says '' 
 & gt *i 'm sorry <unk> if you line up the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> correctly yes it does 
 no you 're wrong 
 i 'm in the right place now where 's my chairs '' 
 & gt <unk> 
 * they 're in aisle 30 bin 2 if this paper is correct 
 i know what it says stop lying to me '' 
 & gt <unk> then i 'm <unk> ma'am i think a sales coworker <unk> a <unk> would be better able to answer your questions what 
 but you ... '' & gt ... good luck 
 <unk> go fuck <unk> and as promptly as possible i vanish back into my beloved valley of boxes to take my break 
 i 'm so sorry for the poor <unk> who had to deal with her afterwards but <unk> that 's why i did n't sign on for customer service 
 my summer job is working at a retail store in the lawn and garden department 
 they have many heavy bags of soil and <unk> that many customers need help loading into their cars 
 i 'm 38 weeks pregnant and so i am not allowed to lift anything above 30 pounds 
 here is how an interaction went yesterday with a customer : c : excuse me i need 12 bags of these 40 pound bags of top soil loaded into my cart 
 me : okay i will go grab somebody to help you 
 it will just be a moment as i am the only one back here so i need to page for someone to come 
 c : i do n't have time for you to call someone 
 i need help now 
 why ca n't you lift them 
 me : smiling while glancing down at myself sir i 'm 38 weeks pregnant and am not allowed to lift anything over 30 pounds 
 c : you do n't look pregnant 
 besides my wife was lifting way more than 30 pounds when she was pregnant up until the day she delivered 
 i 'm disabled and so i have a *real* reason to why i ca n't lift these 
 just pile them in my cart so i can be on my way 
 me : like i said before i will be right back so i can page someone to come help you 
 they will come quick and be able to assist you both with loading them into the cart and into your car 
 c : fine 
 but what is your name so i can talk to a manager about you 
 they will want to know that you are n't helping customers 
 me : my name is <unk> and i can also page a manager to come right over too 
 c : good do that 
 so i walked over to the phone and paged both a stock man and a manager 
 both came within 5 minutes 
 i hear the customer going on about how i refused to help him and how he is a disabled veteran and deserves to be treated better 
 the manager apologized but explained that i am indeed pregnant and ca n't lift those big bags 
 the customer suggested that i be transferred to a different department where i am able to assist every customer with <unk> **especially** helping disabled people 
 oh i 'll try sir ... really i will 
 especially since i 'm a high school special education teacher during the school year ... a customer 's total came up to $ 101.56 
 the customer handed me one $ 100 bill one $ 1 bill and 56 cents 
 i bagged his stuff said thank you come again '' and waited for him to leave so i can help rest of customers in line 
 guy : *just standing in front of counter looking at me* me : * 
 * uh ... do you need anything else 
 guy : i gave you $ 110 
 me : oh you have me exactly $ 101.56 
 guy : **what 
 ** no i gave you ten dollar bill 
 me : sir you gave me the exact total ... guy : what are you talking about 
 i gave you **ten dollar <unk> 
 the guy demanded rest of his imaginary change and refused to leave the counter 
 i asked him if i could help out rest of the customers before trying to figure out where his ten dollars went and he quietly waited next to counter 
 after i helped rest of customers i explained the situation to the manager so we can take a look at the security camera one of which is pointed directly at the register and the counter 
 so we take a look at the scene and what do you know 
 the guy never gave me any $ 10 bill 
 guy : *immediately checks his wallet* <unk> 
 ** $ 10 bill was in his wallet the whole time me : ... ... ... is there anything else can i help you 
 guy : nevermind 
 <unk> in 2004 i had just started my first job at a very small gift store in my tiny home town 
 it was my very first day and i was manning the register 
 my store manager the only other person on shift let 's me know she will be gone for a 10 minute lunch break 
 if i need her call her 
 sure i got this 
 10 minutes turned into an hour 
 then two 
 before i knew it three hours had passed but i was doing well 
 no mistakes figured she got held up with her kids or something 
 a customer purchases an item $ <unk> 
 pays by card 
 cool 
 as i tap in the amount onto the machine i realise in horror i have just charged this poor woman $ <unk> and need to do a refund 
 i am upset and explain to the customer that i will need to call my manager to do it as it was my very first day 
 she is good <unk> and understanding 
 i call my boss on her mobile 
 no answer 
 call again 
 no answer 
 fuck 
 try again 
 this time she picks up 
 what '' 
 me : hi it 's -- -- i 've just made a mistake and need to make a refund on her credit card but i need you to show me how and to approve it '' 
 just get it out of the til 
 i 'll fix it later '' 
 um it 's over $ 100 i do n't have that much in the til '' 
 fuck alright 
 give me 5 minutes '' 
 boss hangs up and i explain to the customer the wait 
 she is cool understands 14 year old me has no real power 
 cool lady 
 15 minutes pass no sign of boss 
 try to call phone is off 
 i am starting to freak out and cry 
 customer is cool talks calmingly to me 
 turns out she knows my mum small town 
 she owns the new bakery and has gotten to know everyone 
 start joking around relaxing with her 
 nearly an hour later boss <unk> up <unk> of sex 
 even in my <unk> i could see she was a mess 
 shirt on backwards makeup smudged hair mussed 
 so mortifying 
 my boss rolls her eyes at the customer 
 ca n't get good workers these days sorry about the idiot '' 
 i feel like i was slapped 
 customer glared at this woman this <unk> boss and then looks at me 
 you start work in my shop at 9am 
 want a ride home '' 
 i left with her worked at her shop until i graduated in 2007 and moved away 
 awesome woman 
 life is sometimes very good 
 tl : dr : customer becomes new employer 
 when i was pregnant in 2011 i was saving up money by selling bread at farmers markets 
 i enjoyed sitting under a <unk> chatting with the other vendors and interacting with the customers 
 the people who bought my bread were usually nice and fell into the <unk> of soccer moms old ladies or young male <unk> i sold organic vegan bread and gluten-free pastries 
 lots of people always commented on my baby bump asking about the gender or due date and <unk> me on my pregnancy 
 the second to last time that i worked at this farmers market in particular three ladies in their 50s or 60s approached my booth 
 i recognized two of the generally pleasant ladies but not the third 
 this is the girl that we 've been telling you about 
 the one that 's going to have the baby '' 
 one of my regular customers said to the youngest looking of the bunch 
 how old are you hun '' 
 i told her that i was 21 
 you married '' 
 she asked 
 she spoke quickly and i remember it sounding like she was a <unk> chicken 
 no but i 'll wrangle a proposal out of my boyfriend some day '' 
 i said smiling even though i always hate when people asked 
 hun we 've been telling this lady all about you '' 
 one of the regulars said to the unfamiliar face 
 this is lady 's name and she wants to adopt your baby '' 
 what was that '' 
 i thought i was mishearing these ladies 
 you should let me adopt your baby <unk> 
 you 're too young to have a kid 
 you 'd be a horrible mother '' 
 i was hormonal pregnant woman that had been working a long hot day in a parking lot and i wanted to kill her 
 i wanted to <unk> her eyes out with <unk> but i somehow managed to keep calm 
 i 'm not interested in putting my child up for adoption 
 sorry 
 so can i interest you ladies in any breads today '' 
 can you at least consider it 
 i can give you some money 
 maybe you can go to school and make something of yourself '' 
 to this day i still do n't know how i did n't kill those three ladies 
 can you excuse me a moment '' 
 i went over to the jewelry vendors next to my tent 
 we knew each other well because of the numerous farmers markets they also set up shop at throughout the week 
 they were the ones who usually helped me set up my tent and tables we watched each others tables when we needed restroom breaks 
 i asked them if they could watch my stand and they did 
 when i got back from the restroom after mentally rehearsing an angry <unk> they were gone 
 one of the regulars stopped by my booth the following week and told me she was n't buying my bread anymore because of how rude i was to her friend 
 later the lady wanting to buy my kid stopped by and asked if i had given it any thought at all 
 i told her no 
 i switched farmers markets with my grandpa after that 
 the next week he told me that some ladies had been asking about my <unk> happened a while ago but has really stuck with me and i like to think about it on really bad days at work 
 i had been working all day in the <unk> department of my store dealing with all manner of rude condescending customers when this little boy maybe 6 or 7 years old and a woman whom i had assumed was his mother came in 
 they were looking to buy some fish for the tank that the little boy had gotten for his birthday 
 he came right on up to me grabbed my hand and asked me very politely if i could find him some fish that would be happy to come live with me '' 
 my heart just about melted 
 i told him that i most certainly could and asked him if he could ask his mom who was a little ways off looking at the betta fish what size his tank was so we could get started 
 he replied she is n't my mommy she is my all pears '' 
 the woman over heard this and saw my obviously confused face and explained that she was his nanny and that his parents called her an au pair '' once and he had liked the way it sounded but apparently could n't pronounce it correctly 
 i helped them find some fish for his 20 gallon tank some mollies and a couple of <unk> and when i had finished bagging them up and handed them off to the all pears '' the little boy gave a little tug on my apron and thanked me for helping them 
 he also asked if he could give me a hug and take a picture with me and his new fish 
 so i knelt down to his level and let him throw an arm around me while his other hand held the bag of fish and the nanny took our picture 
 it was just the sweetest thing i have ever had happen to me at work 
 the nanny came in about a week later when i was working to get more food for the fish and told me that the little boy had asked her to print the picture out and that now it sits on his desk right next to his tank where the fish can see '' it so that they do n't miss their old house and their old friends '' 
 it makes me smile ever time i think about that little boy and his nanny even though i have n't seen them since that last time the nanny came in 
 he was so sweet and polite and just really made my day that day 
 so yesterday was surprisingly quiet for the week before christmas but i had a older woman in her 70 's come through i know because i had to card her for a 6 pack of beer 
 she paid with debit wanting 60 bucks cash back 
 she then asks as my till pops asking is i can give her all ones 
 i made the comment it might help since i had a waitress come through an hour earlier and i had a lot of ones so i was in the middle of counting when she goes 
 my granddaughter is taking me to my first strip club '' 
 i lost track of my counting and looked up 
 she had a huge smile on her face all i could say was well alright then 
 i recounted her change and gave it to her 
 she left and my co-worker on the till next to me looks over and said that was weird as hell 
 all i could do was nod and go yup 
 this was all yesterday 
 the store i work in has a department that does framing and custom mat cutting so customers can bring in whatever they want framed and often we can do it for them the same day 
 anyways i was covering this department due to the usual guy being sick and things were pretty quiet all day until i got a gentleman at the desk who brought in a portrait drawing very well done btw looking to <unk> it as well as give it a nice look 
 after some looking at what we had available some choices on the color and <unk> of <unk> some paperwork for me to work on it and some talking about the picture itself i learned it was an incredibly valuable and sentimental drawing of this man 's now <unk> brother i did n't ask further for obvious reasons 
 the portrait was incredibly <unk> and i can only assume accurate which i think was making the man a little distressed by looking at it 
 his eyes were going a little red and he was getting a little more quiet as the afternoon went on so i felt it best to let him and his wife walk around while i did all the work for an hour or so 
 after all the work i call him back to the desk and show him the results a really nice monochromatic scale of two mats one <unk> and one solid black with a silver frame <unk> with slight black spots in the <unk> cleaned up glass probably the hardest part of framing and a wire <unk> 
 we walk up to the register for me to give the frame to the cashier and he has me call up my manager while he waits in line 
 i 'm a bit worried and confused since managers are usually called to deal with upset customers and i thought i did alright 
 as i try to think back anything i might have done wrong my manager shows up and the guy pulls him aside and whispers something to my manager that makes him grin from ear to ear then turns to me and tells me how grateful he is for the work 
 he gives me a hard pat on the shoulder with red eyes and passes a tip into my pocket which i assume was him whispering permission from my manager from earlier 
 i 'm <unk> by such generosity since i was just doing my job and i can see then that this picture means much more to him than i could really ever appreciate 
 framing something so sentimental is sort of <unk> because i certainly did n't make something so <unk> on his life in the hour i spent working but the end result rides off the emotional value the picture originally held while increasing it 's <unk> and functional value making me look like a superhero for doing something so basic 
 after receiving the highest praise in my entire career in front of my manager and peers i remembered that yesterday was my last day working at that store i start a new job on monday 
 i guess i get to leave on a <unk> work in an adult shop in a predominantly gay area of my city 
 lots of stories that can be found here short one from yesterday that literally had me laughing out loud 
 a bit of background required 
 our shop has some old signs at the bottom of the rather <unk> set of stairs that you need to climb to enter the shop 
 they are from a sale the boss had long before i started working in the shop just over a year ago 
 the signs are for dvd 's that were on sale 
 no titles are given but the sign does give some cheap prices for dvd 's purchased and <unk> that multiple dvd purchases makes the prices cheaper still 
 to yesterday 
 i spot an old <unk> man coming up the stairs dragging one of those old wheeled shopping carts you usually see little old ladies dragging around 
 he would have been in his late 70 's or older 
 he leaves the cart at the first landing and continues up to the shop 
 looks around a little confused 
 him <unk> ... i saw your sign for dvd 's and thought you might have the sound of music '' but now that i look around i think just maybe i might be in the wrong place 
 me <unk> i am sorry but you most definitely are in the wrong place 
 him as he starts to smile looking around 'i bet you think this is funny do n't you 
 me 'yes sir i have to admit i think it is hilarious 
 him as he starts laughing 'well i think it is pretty funny too 
 i cracked up at that point as he laughing away to himself exited back down the stairs 
 i work in a bakery as the donut girl and am training to decorate cakes 
 yesterday i was there by myself with a bread baker but my bakery manager was on lunch in the sitting area next to the bakery 
 this lady had a cake order that was difficult to understand so i waited until she arrived to finish it 
 she gets here and i explain it to her and she goes oh so it 's not finished 
 can i get ninja turtles instead '' 
 we have ninja turtle cake kit and i show it to her 
 she asks if i can just draw a ninja turtle on there 
 i say probably not 
 i asked my manager <unk> she said absolutely not 
 the lady was irritated well why ca n't you just draw it '' 
 it 's a <unk> image 
 i could be fined $ 5,000 for drawing it '' 
 but i want ninja turtles '' 
 we can put the kit on there 
 it 's only $ 7 '' 
 that 's too much 
 what if we pretend you never looked at the toy 
 can you draw it '' 
 ... no ... '' she gave up after another five minutes of this and got another design for her cake 
 but seriously she was ok with me getting fined $ 5,000 just for the stupid little <unk> <unk> boy walked up to my register holding a playstation network card 
 boy : can you buy games with this 
 me : honestly i 'm not sure 
 the little boy shrugged and decided to buy the card anyway 
 he handed me the card and his money and i cashed him out 
 he <unk> for a minute after i handed him his stuff 
 boy in a borderline snide tone : you work here do n't you 
 how do n't you know about everything in this store 
 me : there are lots of things here i need to know 
 i ca n't know everything 
 i do n't even play playstation 
 boy : oh 
 then what do you play 
 me : i have an xbox 
 boy : ugh xbox is stupid 
 and with that the little boy finally decided he 'd had enough of my <unk> and walked away 
 despite his cheeky little comments he was one of my more pleasant customers that day he *did* hand me his money after all 
 some grown-ass adults ca n't even do that <unk> christmas 
 the one time of year where i 'm willing to work because i get paid double bitches 
 occasionally i get some smart ass customer who asks me why i 'm working on christmas '' to which i wish i could reply with either it 's not christmas in here '' or what are you doing shopping on christmas '' but this time i had a truly memorable story 
 earlier in the day there was a woman who needed help at the self checkout 
 no big deal i just scanned her items and waited for payment but all she had to give me for payment was a dollar 
 in quarters 
 there was nothing in her order that came for $ 1 or less so i explained to her that she was short why do people need math lessons in this day and age 
 i think she said something to the effect of she 'd have to come back so i voided her transaction so i could free up the register for the next customer we were pretty busy in the morning 
 instead of leaving to get more money she kept rummaging through her pockets trying to come up with the total and tried to hand me $ 2 more in quarters as if that would pay for it 
 clearly she was not all there clearly she had no idea how money worked and left after the 5th time i explained to her that $ 3 is not going to cover a $ <unk> purchase 
 it 's never christmas when you work on christmas.i was reading a story about someone being crazy enough to bust into a back room for some <unk> and it reminded me of this 
 i was going to comment it but if got long so here 's a story 
 the one time someone tried to come in to our back room my sm was eating lunch 
 i was n't there but he gave me the story 
 basically sm was on his 30 minute lunch 
 my other coworker there 's only the three of us right now was on the floor at the register 
 there were two people in line 
 if coworker needed help he would 've asked but he did n't 
 so sm is eating minding the security monitor watching coworker just in case it gets too busy and he hears a knock at the door and from the other side excuse me 
 you need to get out here '' 
 he opens the door in case it 's serious to find a woman standing there looking angry 
 sm : what 's wrong '' 
 woman : you need to help him 
 that line in ridiculous and i do n't have time to wait '' 
 sm : ma'am i 'm on lunch right now there 's only one person left in line 
 coworker can help you in just a moment. 
 w : no you get on the other lane so i can leave 
 ill call corporate '' 
 so what does sm do 
 slams the back room door and begins walking to the register 
 on his way he shouts for everyone in the store to hear we 're a small store so he did n't have to be too loud guess i dont get to eat today coworker 
 this lady here is so important she has to interrupt my only <unk> by law required break because she cant be bothered to wait a literal minute '' 
 i wish i could 've seen it 
 ninja edit : words are <unk> post so sorry if the formatting is weird i literally have no idea what i 'm doing 
 so this happened yesterday 
 i work as a sales assistant in a little boutique in my small town 
 we sell clothes jewelry and <unk> and since it 's such a little shop we usually only have one worker at a time especially on wednesday <unk> which is when this incident occured 
 a <unk> looking woman and her daughter walk into the store we 'll call the women cl crazy lady and her daughter does n't need a name because she did nothing 
 i will be me me : good afternoon how are you today 
 big retail smile cl : audibly huffs and continues looking okay maybe she did n't hear me 
 i 'll try again in a minute 
 so i walk over to where is me : have you had a good day today 
 cl : i 'm just looking 
 okay i 'm only looking so can you just let me look 
 do you understand what just looking even means 
 this woman just yelled in my face so i 'm thinking okay then bitch fuck you 
 you can look all you damn want because i 'm not helping you again 
 i keep going with the tasks i was doing when about 10 minutes later i hear this weird tapping 
 i do n't think anything of it because the shop next door always has weird noises 
 the tapping consists for another 5 minutes and gets louder so i have a look to see what it is 
 i find cl just around the corner tapping her foot aggressively 
 cl : finally 
 i 've been needing your assistance 
 why were n't you here to help me 
 me : oh i 'm sorry 
 i was under the impression you were just looking 
 cl : do n't be so damn rude 
 you should be serving people the whole time not just leaving by themselves 
 idiot 
 look i need these pants in a different size 
 she shoves the pants at me very roughly as well 
 the pants she 's given me are from a rack clearly labeled last of the best 
 final item 70 % off '' 
 me : oh sorry but that 's the pair 
 cl : you do n't have anymore 
 what kind of stupid shop is this if you do n't even have the right sizes 
 me : well we did but they 've sold and this is the last pair 
 cl : you know what this shop is fucking useless 
 useless customer service 
 you had me waiting for 15 minutes 
 i obviously needed help you should have been there 
 i am never coming back here ever again so you better understand you have lost a very valuable customer today and i expect you will be fired for this 
 do you understand me 
 she was screaming this as she was leaving the store continuing as she walked out and past our windows 
 i work almost every day and i have literally never seen this lady before so i 'm not worried about losing her business at all 
 i work for an extremely popular coffee chain which is located in a grocery store 
 in retail stores and some other grocery stores different companies people are able to use their phone apps to pay with their gift cards by scanning them or they can type in the card number and pay that way 
 we can not accept the phone app or type in the number at my <unk> you need to have the physical card to swipe 
 this has <unk> in a number of confrontations with customers and this is one of them 
 at the end of a long rush a middle aged lady in a business suit approached my register and ordered her drink 
 as i 'm writing her order on her cup she sighs heavily 
 customer : i hate this store 
 me : slightly surprised at the unprompted rudeness oh 
 customer : yes i hate coming here 
 it 's so horrible you do n't accept the phone app 
 i ca n't get my points when i come here 
 you 're store is basically stealing from me and i do n't appreciate that 
 me : i 'm sorry you feel that way ma'am 
 hopefully we 'll have the app soon and you can finally like our store 
 customer : i mean the regular store has is and other grocery stores type in my number but your store refuses to 
 i hope you lose a lot of business over it and eventually shut down 
 this store deserves it 
 me : then why do n't you go to one of those stores instead 
 customer : this one is on my way to work 
 me : you know you can link a new physical card to your account and use that to pay so you get your points 
 customer : i do n't think i should have to 
 honestly i 'm so frustrated with your store and how it treats its customers 
 it should go out of business 
 me : well let me make your drink ma'am and <unk> losing my job 
 customer : finally realizing how fucking rude she 's been oh ... uh ... i do n't mean your job ... um ... she slunk off and waited for her <unk> latte with extra extra whipped <unk> worked at a grocery store at a full service meat counter - this means if you wanted any type of meat steaks chicken fish etc - not deli meats you had to get it from me behind a counter 
 -- - i was linking up sausages when i was suddenly called out to help some customers 
 thinking this would give me a bit of a break i placed the long line of links down and crossed the <unk> to the meat counter 
 i saw an elderly couple that was dressed in their sunday best and looked like they just came out of the 1930 's 
 i started my usual routine with helping any customer 
 & gt me : '' hi there can i help you two with anything today '' 
 then the gentleman spoke 
 he sounded just like <unk> <unk> and had the <unk> tone he could muster : & gt old man : '' hey there kiddo 
 we 're <unk> for some great food for <unk> 
 we 're gon na be <unk> stuff on a great new grill we got at home '' 
 his excitement was <unk> i suddenly found myself just as happy as he was to help him find something great to make with his new grill 
 & gt me : '' well sir i 'll let you in on a few <unk> here then - i literally *just* finished making some <unk> sausage in the back room i could grab you a few links of that - it should make a fantastic meal on the grill '' 
 then with too much emphasis on every syllable he excitedly asked his wife & gt old man : '' <unk> think <unk> 
 how about some **si-cil-ian** sausages 
 that sounds <unk> kiddo 
 go on and get us some of them **si-cil-ian** sausages '' 
 i went in back grabbed them a few links and showed him what we had 
 & gt old man : '' say kiddo - what 's in those **si-cil-ian** sausages '' 
 as i listed off the large number of ingredients he <unk> <unk> his head along with each ingredient 
 after i finished he replied & gt old man : '' that sounds **perfect** kiddo 
 get us some more of that **si-cil-ian** sausage then we can freeze that right up and eat it another day '' 
 since they had made my day that much better i marked down their sausages to half price told them to have a great day and they went on their way 
 i never saw them again after that but i will always remember how great my day was the time the 1930 's blew through the meat department 
 edit : my first gold ever thanks kind stranger 
 i have a regular customer who is about 15 years old and is somewhere on the autism spectrum 
 he 's not the easiest kid to be around 
 he 's generally pretty hostile and is pretty <unk> in his views about everything but i do n't take it personally 
 and i 'm not supposed to 
 it 's just his way 
 but i always make a point of saying hello and goodbye and trying to hear what he 's trying to tell me when he 's being <unk> 
 it finally got warm enough for him to ride his bike here and so i 've seen a lot more of him lately 
 on wednesday he was here before i got in and he yelled at me for keeping him waiting 
 i told him i was a bit later than usual because my cat needed attention but i was sorry that he was frustrated with waiting 
 then i complimented him on his captain america hoodie and he saluted me so i knew we were friends again 
 he came in today to pick up a book he ordered 
 he brought in his official harry potter elder <unk> to show me 
 it was pretty cool and i told him so 
 he gave me the money for his book and when i walked back to the counter with his change he shouted <unk> '' 
 so i <unk> like he had really done it and tossed his 3 pennies at him 
 he actually smiled at me 
 then he shouted <unk> '' 
 i said no unforgivable curses in the store 
 but it 's okay i could tell you did n't really mean it since it did n't even come close to working '' 
 he was so happy 
 and so am i. i 'm such a hufflepuff.another tale from <unk> friendly neighborhood drive-thru* my fellow <unk> 
 today 's tale takes place not in the cashier booth not in the kitchen not in the parking lot but in the bathroom 
 yes 
 the bathroom 
 while i 'm working i begin to experience a bit of a <unk> in my gut and as is custom i answer nature 's call she seems to have me on <unk> 
 our men 's room features the following <unk> 1 toilet stall two <unk> and a sink 
 i take up position on the toilet and enjoy the relative quiet while i do my <unk> duty 
 i hear the bathroom door swing open followed by the shuffling of feet <unk> in front of a urinal 
 nothing out of the ordinary 
 then comes the faint sound of a zipper opening and a slight grunt from its owner 
 sounds like an elderly gent 
 seems normal 
 then came the sound of ... more grunting 
 okay 
 he 's old hard to pee sometimes 
 makes sense 
 but no 
 the sound of a stream of urine <unk> against <unk> was not the next noise to be heard 
 the next sounds to be heard were a series soft patting noises 
 almost ... <unk> 
 more grunting followed 
 the <unk> of patting and grunting echoing through the bathroom grew in <unk> over the next minute 
 a terrible realization dawned over me as i sat in the stall that i had hoped to be my personal <unk> against the horrors that transpired just a couple of feet away 
 i tried to block it out 
 it did not work 
 a voice in the back of my mind screamed in <unk> this patting noise seems ... familiar 
 no 
 no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no 
 ew 
 <unk> '' 
 *fap fap grunt fap fap fap grunt fap* oh god no why is this happening '' 
 *fap grunt fap fap* please any god every god let this end '' 
 *fap fap fap* there is no <unk> in this world '' 
 *fap fap <unk> it 's over '' 
 and then to <unk> the <unk> <unk> at work i hear him softly mutter oh that was good 
 good show '' 
 did he just ... no 
 oh god no 
 oh <unk> shit no 
 was i just on the receiving end of a penis-serenade from a <unk> old voyeur in the bathroom at work '' 
 my body completely locked up 
 i fought back the urge to vomit 
 i was quickly snapped from my state of shock by the sound of a urinal flush and the shuffling of feet 
 i was relieved to hear that the man whom just <unk> me with a <unk> ambush was leaving the bathroom 
 i do hope he was not expecting any thanks from me for his performance 
 i quickly returned to a state of shock when i next heard the bathroom door swing open and foot-shuffles fading into the distance 
 **he did not wash his <unk> the next two minutes of my life were spent cringing and questioning every single decision in my life that brought me to this moment 
 tl dr- i entered the bathroom a <unk> cheerful <unk> person 
 the horrors i endured in there had left me a broken disheveled <unk> destroyed shell of the man i once was 
 there is no good in the world 
 god is dead 
 hope is a lie.last summer i worked in a big grocery store that also sold some hot dogs and ice cream for hungry customers 
 we sold french hot dogs the ones where the bread is a baguette with a hole in it and you eat <unk> 
 since the dressing has to go in before the hot dog we did this for the customers 
 one day dressing man comes in and buys a french hot dog 
 & gt dm : i want a lot of dressing 
 a lot 
 & gt me : hi 
 i 'll do my best 
 there you go 
 & gt dm : no more than that that 's not enough 
 & gt me : okay here 's some more dressing for you 
 at this point already there is hardly any room for the hot dog 
 & gt dm : no more 
 i always get this much dressing when i come here 
 the girl from last week did it just fine 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry there has to be room left for the hot dog or the bread will crack 
 no one could fit more dressing in this baguette 
 & gt dm : ... just a <unk> bit more 
 i give him another squeeze of dressing and he mutters not satisfied with the amount but takes his hot dog and walks away 
 ten minutes later he comes back 
 & gt dm : i want a new one 
 the bread broke and now there 's dressing everywhere 
 i notice he has eaten more than 3/4 of it 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry i 'll get you a new ... wait you 've already eaten it 
 & gt dm : not all of it and the bread just broke 
 i demand a new one 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry i ca n't give you a new one when you 've already eaten it 
 the bread always breaks in the end with that much dressing 
 he mutters something about never shopping here again and walks away 
 i wonder how many times he has pulled this stunt to get new hot dogs over and over i was on the register scanning bagging blah blah blah 
 woman comes through with her husband and buys a lot of stuff including 2 boxes of cough medicine 
 me : your total is <unk> 
 woman : i do n't have enough 
 take off one of those cough syrups 
 me : sure thing 
 so i voided out the cough syrup and had a total brain fart 
 i said have a nice day '' 
 after she paid and she walked away 
 then my brain finally decided to work and i <unk> i never actually took the cough medicine back 
 i only voided it 
 it was still in her bag 
 me : ma'am you forgot to give me back the cough medicine 
 woman 's husband : no she did n't 
 at this point i could literally see it inside the shopping bag she was holding our bags are flimsy and almost transparent me : uh yeah you still have it 
 i definitely do n't have it 
 they kept walking away and pretending like they could n't hear me 
 after hours and hours of <unk> rude customers a 9 hour shift that seemed to never end and a horrible ache in my feet i had no pleasantries left 
 i ran over to the woman reached into her bag and pulled out one of the cough medicines 
 me : yep there it is 
 have a great day 
 bye 
 see ya 
 and then they had the nerve to <unk> '' at me and shake their heads 
 yeah oops i did n't let you steal 
 <unk> 
 so thanks to the huge response my first story received the other day y'all are getting one more albeit not as great as that tale 
 incidentally this story also deals with credit cards 
 it takes place a year ago shortly after i was first hired part-time at the little convenience store i now work at <unk> 5 days a week 
 it 's an otherwise slow and uneventful sunday 
 around 10am 
 most in this town are at church at this time including the owner and general manager of the store 
 i 'm manning the place on my own for the first time 
 the responsibility was nice a bit intimidating even as i 'm used to having managers surround me at all times while on the clock 
 it was nice to do this though and i figured today would be a calm day 
 not so 
 a gal who looks to be early 20s walks in -- first customer of the day 
 she sticks a cold beer on the counter and asks for two lotto tickets and a pack of <unk> 
 pretty standard convenience store transaction 
 until she gets out her credit card 
 this woman did not understand credit at all 
 she asks why it did n't require a pin 
 i explain that usually debit cards require <unk> 
 this dumbfounded her 
 then as the card is processing those dreaded words appear 
 declined '' 
 i ask if she has something else 
 she pulls out another card swipes it and it works 
 this hilarious exchange follows : her : do n't you just love credit 
 i hear people complaining about it all the time but i do n't get it 
 it 's free money you know 
 am i right or what '' 
 no lady you 're not.posting from mobile 
 sorry in advance for spelling 
 to start things off this was last year when i had broken my right hand which was also my writing hand 
 i had a cast that went all the way up to my elbow and my fingers were a lovely purple colour so it was pretty obvious that i was injured 
 still in pain and looking like mega man i soldier on and go to work a few days after my accident and just work the register 
 i work in a card and gift store so it was n't too tough using the one hand and most of the customers were pretty understanding and patient 
 then this lady comes to the counter with a card ... i say hi '' and smile 
 she says nothing and throws the card on the counter 
 i scan it through tell her the amount complete the sale blah blah blah 
 still no word or even a smile 
 i bag up her card awkwardly with my one hand and pass it over to her but she instantly rips it out of the bag and places it back on the counter 
 lady customer : i need you to write in this card for me '' 
 this happens pretty often and i would usually do it but obvs ca n't with a broken hand me : i 'm really sorry i usually would but ... '' *points to <unk> i 've broken my hand and ca n't even grasp a pen if i wanted to '' 
 lady customer : *sighs* just try '' 
 me : i ... i really ca n't 
 my hand is broken '' 
 lady customer : for gods sake it 's not that hard 
 use your other hand then '' 
 me : i 'm not left handed so it 's going to be really messy though ... '' she grunts and sighs and insists i just try 
 so i get a piece of paper and ask her what she wants written to see how well i can write with my left hand 
 it was pretty pathetic but hey i 've never been forced to write with my left hand 
 what do you expect 
 i 'm halfway through writing the name on the piece of paper when she grabs the card off the counter and says ... oh my god 
 i 'll just do it my self '' 
 and storms out 
 bitch really 
 sorry for having a broken hand and not thinking about how you might need me to write your own damn card out for you 
 how can she even have friends to buy cards for 
 edit : i 'm not looking for any any karma for this 
 i think it 's want any human being would do 
 unfortunately there are a lot of <unk> running things 
 when i was in college 1970s i worked at a fast food place that was right across from a large college campus in a very liberal southern city 
 a lot of <unk> homeless people etc 
 hung out near campus 
 we would regularly have two or three people in their late teens early twenties come in to the store come up to the counter and ask for packets of salt 
 these folks looked like any other <unk> that walked into our store 
 i would give them 5-6 packets and think nothing of it 
 then a co-worker told me they were homeless and using the salt to add flavor to the dry dog food they lived off of 
 it made me sad 
 after a few weeks of doing this once or twice a week my manager who was a royal douchebag told me i could no longer give these people free salt 
 it was costing the store too much money 
 i explained to him that these folks were eating dog food to survive and i would happily pay for the salt if he told me how much it was 
 he refused and told me i could not give out any more salt 
 so i did what any normal <unk> american would do 
 whenever these folks came in and ask for free salt i would tell them i was sorry but i could n't give out any salt unless they ordered something 
 at the same time i casually handed one of them a dollar and asked what they would like to order 
 most of our items were priced at well below a dollar 
 the guy would order a couple of items and ask for salt which i gave him plenty of 
 instead of the 5-6 packets i had been handing out i gave him <unk> packets with his order 
 my douchebag manager could n't do anything about it because they were ordering food and therefore customers 
 he tried to tell me i could not give them money and i just replied he 's a friend of mine 
 i owed him a dollar '' 
 this store had already been sued successfully for wrongful termination so he did n't want any more <unk> 
 i continued to do this until i quit about a year <unk> 'm on my lunch break now but i just want to pop in with a quick post 
 i work at a pharmacy retail store and we 're doing a fundraiser with a fund for children that almost no one nose about 
 i 'm in a very affluent area and all of these rich customers keep trying to <unk> their guilt aloud with me 
 here 's how almost all of these scenarios are playing out : me : do you want to buy a red nose or donate a dollar to help children in <unk> today 
 customer : no 
 i actually donate to a lot of <unk> 
 me : ok 
 your total is x. would you like a bag 
 c : we donate to st. jude 's children fund every year i just did a charity walk we donate to buy underprivileged children every christmas we ... me : cool ... 
 do you want a bag 
 c : i 'm a very charitable person 
 me : sure sounds like it 
 do you want a bag 
 i am not sitting here judging you 
 i am required to ask every customer 
 a simple no thanks not today '' will do 
 i 'm sure you 're very <unk> ma'am 
 but please do not submit your tax return to me every time i ask you to <unk> happened to me a few years back while i was a store lead assistant to the assistant manager a position that basically gives the authority to override the register and deal with small stuff so the manager does n't have to and a colored name tag to show the change in status 
 i was building a new floor display when i heard a customer starting to get very vocal in appliances so i went over to see if i could help out 
 i heard his voice escalate and his language became very insulting to the associate who was helping him so i radioed loss prevention to let them know there was a disturbance brewing 
 i was approaching the customer from behind when the beleaguered associate raised his hand to signal me 
 this caused the customer to turn around and face me and i could immediately tell he was on something 
 i do n't know if it was booze or drugs but his body odor <unk> everything anyway 
 the following is the exchange as i remember it : & gt <unk> customer : finally 
 a f*ing manager 
 & gt me : sir i 'm going to have to ask you to lower your voice in the store 
 & gt ic : i 've had it with you f*ing <unk> telling me to calm down 
 i am f*ing calm 
 fffffffff*****iinggggggg <unk> 
 & gt me : sir please do n't use that kind ... and then i heard two loud noises and i was suddenly facing to my left 
 it took a moment to register that i had just been punched by his right hand then his left in quick <unk> 
 i did n't even see it coming 
 but i 'm still standing just facing left 
 the whole store is quiet 
 as i turn to face him again i am outwardly calm but freaking out internally about what is going to happen next 
 i 'm in ok shape but i do n't work out and world of warcraft had taken its toll on my body at this time 
 i have never been in a fight before never even thrown a punch 
 i have no idea what is going to happen next 
 but then as i turn to face him again my neck pops like when you pop your knuckles 
 a very loud pop in the silence that has fallen 
 quick aside i have always been able to make my <unk> pop not just in my hands but almost every place bones meet 
 <unk> knees shoulder neck back jaw whatever 
 so looking this man square in the eye i leaned my head to the right *pop* then slowly back to the left *pop* 
 then back to center 
 and he started to cry 
 no words just tears falling down his cheeks 
 probably the sight of loss prevention and the store managers approaching quickly forced him to realize how much trouble he was in he was eventually charged with assault in the fourth degree class a misdemeanor but i like to believe my neck pops just <unk> him into <unk> 
 edit 1 : wow front page 
 glad people enjoyed the worst/best story i have from retail 
 i work at a home improvement store in the midwest 
 i 'm also half asian so on a <unk> basis i 'm asked <unk> why are you brown '' 
 always by white men 
 it 's terribly annoying 
 here is one such instance : it 's the end of the night and a man in his mid-twenties seems excited to see me 
 i can see it in his face he 's going to ask the usual question 
 & gt '' i hope this is n't annoying but where are you from '' 
 queue my internal groan 
 & gt '' i 'm from <unk> eisley '' 
 & gt '' oh wow i 've never heard of there '' his eager smile is wide and weird where is it '' 
 & gt '' it 's on <unk> 
 a mostly desert region '' 
 & gt '' very cool 
 i dated a girl from <unk> once '' 
 & gt '' ... great '' 
 i replied 
 thankfully at this time i 've rushed ringing up and checking out his items as we talk i tell him to have a good evening 
 he leaves with a goofy wave and i sigh in disbelief 
 the title is a pretty neat tl dr and the story explains the rest so without further <unk> : & gt phone rings i answer me : hello 
 caller : yes hello i 'm at other <unk> 's store and i 've just bought some a5 paper that i wanted to print on but their colour machine is n't working can you print on that 
 me : well actually we can print colour and we can print a5 size but we actually print two up on an a4 sheet 
 we ca n't print on a5 size directly though because the machines just do n't understand it 
 no matter which way we try to put it in it just does n't go in 
 it does n't feed 
 so we can print for you but not onto that a5 paper no 
 caller : but i had it done at store which closed down four years ago 
 me : really 
 caller : yeah but they 're closed now 
 me : oh 
 are they 
 caller : yes 
 me : ah 
 short pause caller : so can you print on this paper 
 me : we can do colour printing that 's just fine 
 that 'd be in a4 size though but we ca n't print onto a5 paper directly unfortunately 
 caller : but i had it done at store 
 me : yeah but they 're closed now are n't they 
 caller : yeah 
 me : yeah ... pause of *at least* one minute caller : hello 
 me : yes 
 caller : are you still there 
 me : yes i 'm still here 
 just wondering if you have any further questions 
 caller : ... well ... i 'm returning this paper then 
 and with that query essentially <unk> we both hung up our <unk> anyone who has worked in retail knows that employees sometimes have to go through or use <unk> or <unk> techniques 
 at my job we have to use open ended questions but not just what brings you into day '' 
 no we have to ask personal question that have nothing to do with why they came to shop and a lot of times are creepy and/or ineffective 
 the whole day my manager had been on my ass for not using the techniques 
 i tried using them but every client i did felt as if i was coming on like a cheesy used car salesman on commission 
 till this happened 
 me : & gt hello sir what brings you in today 
 customer : & gt i am looking for a desktop *me using the corporate techniques* me : & gt ah okay i must say those are some nice shoes customer : & gt thanks man me : <unk> using the techniques* & gt so tell me about yourself what are your needs and wants *now like i sound like i 'm on a date with the <unk> customer : & gt uh yeah i need another computer mine died on me yesterday 
 i just use it for the basics 
 <unk> emails words <unk> <unk> 
 etc '' me : & gt alright <unk> notes like i 'm suppose <unk> & gt do you mind if i take notes 
 customer : & gt go ahead *note : a lot of customers think its a survey 
 & gt what happened to your old computer 
 customer : & gt kid broke it me : & gt how many kids do you have 
 *at this point my manager is hovering over me making sure i ask these trivial questions instead of just being a regular guy and trying to find him the right product customer : & gt does it matter 
 look man i just want to get a computer me : *at this point i just kind of want to be real with him but hovering manager & gt '' i 'm sorry sir i 'm just asking question to better help you choose the right computer '' & gt so what do you do for a living customer : <unk> visibly annoyed* *looks at <unk> & gt are you the manager 
 & gt look man i know you guys have policies but yeah that shit does n't work 
 customers just want a normal non-forced conversation and to get in and get out in my head : & gt finally 
 someone gets it 
 edit : gold 
 thank you guys 
 i never would have thought this would have gotten gold 
 i do want to say from my own experience i have gotten better more accurate results and happier clientele that personally come back to see me because i do n't treat the customer like they are an idiot 
 i have a normal conversation with that person and <unk> i end up selling them warranty or whatever they need to fit their needs 
 i do n't need to constantly remind them about our x month financing option every time they see an item 
 i let them know it 's there i ask questions pertaining to the item they wish to purchase 
 <unk> or not but i will tell you when a computer is straight up shit 
 management does n't like us doing so they like us saying that those computers are our hot buys '' 
 no they are hot shit 
 a $ <unk> computer with a <unk> <unk> will not play world of warcraft or do heavily <unk> 
 and because of that i naturally build rapport with them 
 not by asking what their favorite color is false <unk> and coming off like a <unk> salesman who does n't care about your experience because i genuinely want you to like your item 
 edit : <unk> i was working today and i had these three hispanic ladies come walking up 
 we had a veterans day coupon out and the head <unk> of the group had something like 8 of the exact same coupon and wanted to break them up into split transactions to use all 8. well we obviously ca n't do that so as she shoves the coupons into my face i let her know that we can only use one even across multiple transactions due to someone abusing the system prior and <unk> us unable to do that 
 at this point her limited english completely stops and she starts talking to the two other ladies with her in nothing but spanish 
 the <unk> starts talking crap on me various levels of insults from how i do n't know what i 'm talking about to how i should n't have a job and then one of the ladies pipes up : & gt <unk> in spanish : this kid thinks he 's hot sh*t telling us what to do like that '' 
 & gt <unk> in spanish : i know right 
 he probably just ca n't wait to go home and f**k his mother tonight '' 
 so by this point i 'm fuming 
 i 've had three years of spanish plus a couple of months in mexico - i may be the whitest kid you 'll find in my state but i 'm fairly well-versed in the spanish language 
 i keep up the charade until their card goes through 
 at this point i rip the receipt from the register 
 & gt <unk> in spanish : so here 's a link to a survey we have our customers do just to let us know how we 're doing 
 i do n't f**k my mother at night and you saved a total of $ <unk> today here 's your receipt have a wonderful day 
 by now all three ladies are looking at me with that horrified look on their faces as they 've now realized that i understood essentially everything they spoke in spanish 
 they <unk> off over to the customer service desk and ask to speak to a manager and i never hear about it again 
 tl dr : i 'm <unk> than a <unk> and i live in the mountain west area but that does n't mean i do n't know <unk> christmas 
 the <unk> season of late minute customer panic and snotty behaviour 
 & amp nbsp i work at a large liquor store and this particular story starts in the <unk> rush although the whole day was just one rush 
 & amp nbsp this lady l comes up to my colleague col and says : & amp nbsp & gt l : do you have any <unk> 
 & gt col : sorry we 're all sold out 
 & gt l : are you sure 
 & gt col : yes 
 & gt l : do you have any out back 
 & gt col : no 
 we 're all sold 
 out 
 & gt l : but it 's a christmas present 
 & gt col : not any more it is n't 
 & amp nbsp when my colleague said that i tried to control my laughter and failed 
 it was my colleague 's first christmas and they handled it <unk> 
 & amp nbsp merry christmas my lovely retail friends 
 & amp nbsp edit : formatting so this was back something like 9 or 10 years ago 
 i was working at huge electronics/computer store and one of the aisles i had to <unk> was the toy aisle 
 oh and i should mention that it 's christmas season 
 i 'm walking down the aisle to <unk> it up and <unk> some of the stuff 
 i see this lady in the aisle 
 i walk straight up to her and ask her if i can help her find something 
 i 'll summarize the exchange 
 i ask her if she needs help 
 she says that she does 
 i ask her what she 's looking for she tells me it 's a remote control ufo that asks kids math questions and when he kids shout back the correct answer it does a small laser light show 
 sounds cool right 
 i ask her if she knows what it 's called or who makes it because at this point i 'm actually psyched about how cool the you sounds 
 she tells me that she 's never actually seen it she just knows my store has a reputation for having a lot of cool stuff and if anyone had it we would 
 seriously lady 
 let me repeat 
 it 's an rc ufo that kids yell math answers at to be rewarded with a laser light show 
 that 's kind of a specific request for a toy that you have no evidence of existing 
 i work as a manager for <unk> eating <unk> restaurant 
 a few weeks back i was helping out the drive thru by working on the <unk> window basically <unk> the bags that are being thrown at me and passing drinks and food out of the window to the waiting cars 
 generally this is an easy task and you have no worries 
 this day however something snapped and everyone was l rude to us 
 one customer sticks out in my mind and this is how it went 
 customer pulls up to window after just paying for <unk> worth of items 
 me hey there wo n't keep you a minute 
 *hands out 4 drinks in a <unk> holder and one drink <unk> at this point the lady rolls her eyes and mutters to her daughter cust for fucks sake they always do this 
 me is something wrong ma'am 
 cust why the hell have you given me all of this 
 me did you not order it all 
 cust of course i did 
 i think i know what i ordered 
 me okay ... so what seems to be the issue 
 cust how the hell do you expect me to drive home safely with all of this 
 me i ... i do n't know 
 perhaps your family could hold it 
 cust no 
 that is out of the question 
 me what the hell do you want me to do then 
 cust this is ridiculous 
 sort it out next time 
 i will complain about you 
 *customer starts to drive anyway at this point* me have a safe drive 
 my senior managers were standing next to me as i had started to raise my voice and were just <unk> themselves with laughter 
 did n't hear a single complaint from her after that 
 was kinda disappointed 
 tl dr : customer gets angry for ordering too much 
 long time lurker first time poster 
 i work at a gas station 
 we get our fair share of crazies on a daily basis and i could tell you hundreds of stories but today i 'll tell you just one 
 so on this day it was early in the morning before the sun was even up and 3rd shift was nearly over 
 i was tired and ready to leave because i had just pulled a double because the 3rd shifter decided not to show up 
 all alone in the store i was pretty much just getting ready for the soon to come morning rush 
 a lady walks in carrying one of the coffee mugs we sell at our stores 
 when you bring it in and fill it up we charge it as a refill and you save some money 
 she gets over to the coffee pots looks at me looks at them looks back at me and says there 's not enough coffee '' 
 now i had just made two fresh pots of each type of coffee we have so there was plenty of coffee needless to say i was confused 
 i walk over here and look to make sure i was n't losing my mind and sure enough the coffee was all still there 
 i tell her ma'am i just made all these pots of coffee not too long ago it 's all fresh and you can take as much as you 'd like '' 
 she replies with no there 's not enough to fill my mug 
 you need to make more 
 do it quickly '' 
 i see she has a 32 oz mug and our coffee pots are 30 oz each so we had 60 oz total of the kind she wanted more than enough to fill her mug 
 i inform her of this and she starts to get agitated saying no 
 i come here all the time and it takes three pots to fill me mug 
 would you please make another one 
 at this point i give up and start brewing another pot of coffee 
 6 minutes later the coffee is all brewed up she takes it and fills her mug up 
 one whole pot goes in and she smiles at <unk> if she had proven i was an idiot 
 she grabs a second pot and pours barely any in leaving nearly 2 full pots 
 as much as i wan na rub it in her face that i was right i hold my tongue and wait for her to get to the counter so i can ring her out 
 she puts the cap on her mug and casually starts walking out the door before i stopped her 
 she looks at me funny and says what 
 they usually give it to me free when i have to wait '' 
 not today lady i tell her well miss we actually are n't allowed to do that 
 the only time we can allow that is when the coffee is old and the customer is forced to wait 
 you requested a pot of coffee while there were 2 fresh pots available 
 i 'm going to have to charge you for it '' 
 now the show begins 
 for this part of the story <unk> will stand for be crazy coffee lady **ccl** - what this is ridiculous there was n't enough coffee '' 
 **me** - no ma'am there 's was plenty of fresh coffee available for you to use 
 it seems you may have <unk> just how big our coffee pots are '' 
 **ccl** - no 
 i come here every day 
 it always takes three 
 you must have made them bigger '' 
 **me** - well i did tell you that the pots were 30 oz each '' 
 **ccl** - i have been coming to this store for years and this is how you treat me 
 how much is it '' 
 **me** - that will be $ 1.07 do you have your rewards card '' 
 **ccl** - what 
 how 
 i thought it was $ <unk> 
 you 're just trying to rip me off '' 
 **me** - no <unk> that 's just the tax added to the total '' 
 **ccl** - i 'm not paying for this '' 
 she gives me a smug look 
 then i take her coffee mug and place it out of her reach behind the counter 
 **me** - well miss i 'm sorry but i ca n't let you leave with free coffee 
 i can go dump this coffee out if you want and give you your mug back 
 are you sure you do n't want the coffee '' 
 **ccl** - give me back my mug this is theft i 'll call the cops '' 
 **me** - are you wanting to buy the coffee '' 
 **ccl** - fine 
 yes i 'll buy it just do n't expect to ever see me in here again 
 this is terrible service 
 as expected from a gas station i suppose '' 
 ahh music to my ears i love it when people say i 'll never come back '' 
 makes me feel amazing after interactions like this 
 **me** - alright then like i said before the total is $ 1.07 
 do you have your rewards card '' 
 **ccl** - look i do n't have the cash on me right now 
 i 've gone through enough ca n't you just let me have it 
 it 's only coffee '' 
 **me** - sorry ma'am i ca n't do that '' 
 i took her mug to the sink and poured out all the coffee i shed a single tear as i wished it safe journey 
 she flips out one last time at me saying really 
 you 're just going to pour it out instead of giving it to me 
 i 'm going to call corporate and get you fired 
 she stormed out of the building got in her truck and peeled out of the parking lot 
 i had a good laugh and could n't wait for the first shifters to get there so i could tell them this story 
 we get people like this every so often that think they 're clever and can get free stuff out of us 
 but not at my gas station you wo n't especially if you do n't have your rewards card 
 back before the national chains drove them out of business there used to be local electronic stores 
 i worked for one of these for a couple of years 
 the store was located in a pretty good neighborhood but not far from a not so good neighborhood 
 one day i was back in the warehouse area checking on something when i heard a commotion from our car install bay 
 i went back to see the installer outside yelling at a guy who was running off carrying something 
 some <unk> crackhead looking guy had walked into the install bay and grabbed a power amp that was sitting in the trunk of a customer 's car prior to being installed and just ran off with it 
 i told the installer to call 911 and that i would follow the guy and keep him in sight 
 the guy was n't moving fast at all 
 he looked to weigh about 120 pounds and this was a big amp that probably weighed 40 or 50 pounds 
 he was barely able to get above a fast walk 
 he soon noticed me following him and called out for me to stop or he would kick my ass 
 this seemed unlikely as i was in excellent shape at the time and was experienced in dealing with people wanting to kick my ass from my second job as a nightclub <unk> 
 so i continued to follow him 
 a bit later he called out that he had a gun and if i continued to follow him he would shoot me 
 this also seemed unlikely 
 if he actually had a gun he would have led with that instead of the absurd threat of physical violence 
 also i was n't trying to close with the guy just keep him in sight until the cops arrived 
 i figured i was well out of crackhead <unk> range 
 we were in a <unk> neighborhood and apparently <unk> were calling in as we passed including one who heard the gun threat 
 soon i was hearing sirens from all directions 
 cars converged on the guy from three directions at once <unk> were pointed instructions were yelled and the guy dropped the amp and went face down on the ground 
 for my part i stood very still with my empty hands in plain view 
 the best part was him yelling threats at me that he had a gun even though he did n't turned his crime from misdemeanor theft into the class a felony of armed robbery 
 instead of the fine and probation he likely would have received he ended up sentenced to twelve years 
 about a year ago i was at the cash register at the sub shop i work at when a family comes in 
 nice looking family dad and two sons about 12 and 10. the dad asks the 12 year old <unk> buddy what would you like '' 
 the 12 year old orders a sandwich and then the dad orders one for himself 
 i look at the 10 year old who turns to his dad and says 'i really want a sandwich dad '' 
 then you should have got an a on your project '' 
 he mumbles towards the kid 
 but i got a c. '' the little kid says but the dad ignores him and keeps looking at me 
 i stare at him confused and tell him his total 
 he pays and they get their food 
 once again the kid asks for a sandwich 
 the dad tells him he can have left overs when he gets home 
 to my shock dad and older brother eat their food at the restaurant with this little kid just looking on 
 the older brother is teasing him with his food i have a sandwich and you get left overs haha 
 and the dad is too busy on his phone to really care 
 i know this is n't child abuse and i do n't know their lives and stories but damn…that was cold 
 *edit : * i really enjoyed reading the comments and seeing others opinions on this 
 i would n't consider this so much abuse but really strict parenting that i personally would feel horrible doing 
 no there really was n't anything i could do but give a 'i 'm judging you glare 
 he is still feeding his kid as far as i know although he is making him feel like shit in the process 
 *edit 2 : * yes i get it i was a scumbag for not giving the kid a free sandwich you all can stop <unk> me about it now 
 *edit 3 : * til redditors have strong opinions on <unk> used to work at a gas station and like with most retail jobs i had my fair share of rude customers 
 i was behind the register talking to a friend who 'd popped in to say hi when a customer approached the front counter 
 okay cool just needed to be rung up 
 standard stuff 
 the customer was a lady who looked to be in her late 30 's - she had no makeup on that i 'd noticed was modestly dressed and her hair was drawn tight into a <unk> at the <unk> of her neck 
 pretty typical looking woman for the small conservative town i worked in 
 i guess this is where i should mention that i was wearing red lipstick that night as i did during many of my shifts 
 i <unk> me some red lipstick 
 i made some friendly small talk but throughout the entire transaction this lady was silent 
 and she was staring at my mouth 
 i got weird vibes that she was angry about something but i did n't ask why i went to hand her the grocery bag and told her to have a good night 
 i do n't like your lipstick '' 
 her response snapped out of her mouth like she 'd been trying to hold it in but just could n't do it anymore 
 what '' 
 your lipstick - it 's too dark 
 i do n't like it '' 
 i kind of froze not sure how to respond to her <unk> <unk> of my makeup 
 did she really think that her opinion about my lipstick was so important that she *had* to share it 
 when i do n't know what to say i just smile 
 so i did that 
 she tried to <unk> saying that red just did n't look good on me but i just kept smiling 
 the more she spoke the wider my smile got 
 my friend who had been watching the entire time tried to <unk> his laughter and failed miserably 
 i think that was the moment when she realized how completely inappropriate she was being and hightailed it out of there 
 i still get annoyed when i think of that interaction 
 i wear lipstick for <unk> not to cater to *your* specific tastes lady 
 people can be so <unk> i <unk> tfr 
 i just saw this happen last night 
 so i work customer service at a wholesale club in the us 
 for those unfamiliar with wholesale clubs you purchase a year 's membership and get all your info recorded in our database 
 it 's no secret as we ask for your license and all the <unk> when you sign up 
 when you check out you need your membership card so naturally all your purchases are recorded no matter which club you use it at 
 last night i 'm manning the desk when my supervisor who is about my age within a few years of twenty walks over to me 
 & gt hey uh <unk> 
 what do we do when we <unk> credit card fraud 
 & gt i do n't know 
 get a manager i guess 
 why 
 & gt that guy at self-checkout is trying to use like ten credit cards over there 
 & gt shit really 
 i look over and see this guy with <unk> <unk> and <unk> in getting frustrated with the card machine because it keeps declining his card s 
 my supervisor radios the manager asking him to come to the supervisor counter 
 our manager comes over and my supervisor alerts him to the situation 
 this whole time dreadlocks guy 's light is flashing because his payment keeps getting declined 
 my manager goes over to him and helps '' him out mainly as an excuse to get a closer look without <unk> the guy 's suspicion 
 surprisingly the guy did n't even seem nervous about my manager being right there the whole time 
 he just kept right on going 
 eventually the guy left 
 we immediately go over and <unk> his receipt and find that lo and behold the guy left his cart behind with some stuff in it 
 apparently he had tried to break it up into several transactions and gave up on the latest one 
 we look inside the cart and see two packs of <unk> air <unk> and a rug 
 hidden underneath the rug were a $ 100 itunes gift card a $ 50 google play gift card and nine 9 
 visa gift cards worth $ 200 each 
 i do n't remember how much he had already succeeded in loading up and making off with 
 now here 's the good part 
 using his receipt the manager pulled up his membership 
 last year the guy spent $ 400 maybe $ 500 
 this year he spent just shy of $ <unk> 
 he looked up his purchase history and we saw hundreds of visa gift cards purchased in clubs in several states and even the occasional batch of groceries 
 it was insane 
 i do n't know what happens next and i likely wo n't find out but if i do i 'll update you guys 
 tl dr : guy uses stolen credit cards also uses membership card with all his personal information on it 
 edit : one missing word and replaced <unk> '' with because '' 
 autocorrect sometimes 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven 
 i 've posted a few other stories here if you 're interested 
 **story : ** i think because of the type of business i have a fireworks tent in a parking lot that people who come to shop just assume that they can wheel and deal to get a better price 
 they 're right 
 i own the place i set the prices and i get to make the rules 
 we always try to throw in something extra for our customers 
 where i 'm from in louisiana it 's known as <unk> which means “a little something <unk> 
 it 's kind of like a baker 's dozen 13 instead of 12 
 if you come in with a great attitude pick out your stuff and are friendly to my staff i 'm going to make sure you leave happy 
 i love the customers that come in and try to get a deal by telling us that they <unk> the <unk> 
 you would not believe how often this happens 
 my standard response when someone tells me this is ... <unk> : ** i’m supposed to get a discount 
 i know the owner 
 **me : ** great 
 if you can just have him give me a call we can go ahead and give you the standard 50 % discount 
 if we’re slow my other favorite scenario is to tell them that we’ll check the <unk> list” to see if they’re supposed to get their stuff for free 
 i’ll then <unk> yell out and randomly ask each employee if they’ve seen the comp list while obviously making no attempt to look myself 
 most of my employees are in on the joke and will just say no or claim they saw some other employee looking at it 
 the credit for the best response goes to my good friend steven who kindly takes a few days off from his real job to help me out when i’m really busy 
 when he’s helping i think of him as another manager 
 i trust his judgment and if he wants to give a discount or step in and take care of an issue more power to him 
 steven had been helping out a problem shopper and the guy had really worn him out 
 i’d been helping out other people but i’d seen steven going round and round with this guy 
 typical entitled angry shopper eas 
 steven is showing him around and explaining what everything does 
 meanwhile the guy is basically berating steven the entire time 
 he doesn’t like the stuff we have our prices are too expensive he can get a better deal down the road it goes on and on 
 the guy finally gets up to the counter to check out and steven goes off to help someone else 
 after a few minutes the cashier calls steven back to the counter 
 steven had already given the guy a couple of free things to try and make him happy but the eas is now demanding a discount on his entire purchase 
 i’m standing about 15 feet away helping another customer when i stop and look over just in time to catch this exchange 
 **eas : ** i’m supposed to get a discount 
 i know the owner 
 **steven : ** you do 
 you must be the guy he called me about 
 **eas : ** yes 
 **steven : ** he said that you were an asshole and that i should charge you double for whatever you wanted 
 steven turned around and walked away eas angrily paid and stormed out of the tent and i turned and went right back to helping my customer who was now laughing her ass off 
 & gt <unk> responses from my single days : ** & gt & gt a selection of some of my responses when it was a beautiful woman claiming they knew the owner to get a discount 
 & gt & gt **me : ** hello i 'm the owner 
 have you ever considered marrying for money 
 & gt & gt **me : ** i hear the owner is a fastastic guy 
 are you going out with him 
 would you like to be 
 & gt & gt **me : ** hello i 'm the owner 
 would you like to discuss your discount over coffee 
 & gt & gt **me : ** the owner told me we were only allowed to give discounts if the woman was topless 
 & gt & gt **me : ** i 'm sorry i 'm the owner but i do n't remember you 
 did we sleep together 
 in our store 's range we have seasonal goods which at this time of year is mostly travel goods suitcases luggage tags luggage scales and the like 
 the suitcases generally come in 4 sizes from the <unk> <unk> ones right up to an enormous family sized case 
 usually people only buy one or two of these at a time 
 this day a lady came in and i was stood at the end of an aisle tidying 
 she asked me where the suitcases were and i told her so she went off 
 by the time she returned to pay i was back at my till and she came over 
 now generally if people are buying suitcases i like to ask if they 're planning a trip anywhere nice it 's that time of year 
 the lady was buying an entire set of suitcases so i assumed it was a long trip somewhere 
 her answer was <unk> 
 she explained that her husband of almost 50 years had developed <unk> and it had reached a point where he did n't even <unk> her or any family members and could barely remember things he did hours previously 
 so she was making arrangements for him to go into permanent care so he could receive the best care he needed 
 i honestly did n't know what to say at that point 
 : short and sweet story of an idiot woman i had come in today 
 i 'm working at the show a very popular event where i 'm from where there are animals rides craft tents <unk> judging <unk> and a <unk> of food stalls and i 'm in a cafe mostly run by <unk> - i 'm a paid worker 
 cut to post busy lunch where everyone is changing bins restocking doing dishes etc 
 i 'm approached by a woman at the coffee machine 
 she is cb - clueless bitch 
 cb : do you have milk bottles 
 i want them all 
 me : hi we have just <unk> and changed the bins around sorry ma'am they have all been thrown out 
 cb : well *i* need them for the <unk> milk that i 'm about to get 
 so i need one now 
 me : i do n't think you understand 
 we do n't have any 
 they are thrown out in the big skip <unk> away 
 cb : <unk> the milk bottles next to the machine that are clearly very full what about those 
 how long will it take to empty them by serving coffee 
 me : <unk> out in to the empty store ma'am i can not predict that 
 there is no one here right now it could take ten minutes to an hour 
 cb : well i certainly ca n't wait that long 
 what are you going to do about this 
 this is very bad service 
 at this point i 'd had enough of her stupidity 
 this is a temporary job for me and these people are keeping me until the show is over so i was in no danger of losing this job 
 me : well in fact ma'am you 've walked in here not buying anything demanding milk bottles that we clearly do n't have for your own personal use and now complaining that we have bad service 
 i recommend that you bring your own next time unless you 'd like to wait an hour for one 
 but by the way you 've spoken to me i highly doubt i 'd even give it to you 
 cb : well well ... i never 
 where is your manager 
 me : there is no manager 
 this is a volunteer run cafe 
 these people have better things to do than wait at your beck and call to give you something you were too lazy to get for yourself prior to coming here 
 cb turns red storms out 
 victory 
 we do n't need to deal wit yo shit 
 i work in a small town <unk> that also happens to take bills 
 we take bills any time between 8 am to 8 pm but after that our computers will not process any more 
 some most people seem to ignore the fact that we physically can not do anything with the bills after that even if we wanted to and get angry 
 trust me i 've seen it all 
 the other day something happened though that i 'll never forget 
 at around 8:30 a young woman walked in with a bill in her hand 
 as soon as i saw that i told her i 'm so sorry after 8 we can not take any more bills '' 
 expecting to hear a tantrum like so many before her she surprised me and simply said you should n't apologize it 's not your fault '' 
 smiled and walked out 
 probably the one and only time i 'll ever hear those words from a <unk> time lurker first time poster english is n't my <unk> language and so <unk> this story was years ago 
 i was just returning home from a clinic but decided to get some stuff from next door convenience store 
 i got what i need and then proceed to go to the cashier 
 the cashier looked pale and was n't very focused on anything 
 even when i put all my groceries she did n't seem noticed it 
 & gt me : hello 
 i need you to ring this up 
 & gt cashier c : oh i 'm sorry sir would that be all 
 & gt me : yes you looked pale are you alright 
 & gt c : i 'm okay sir that would <unk> suddenly she gave me what i would call 'shower of vomit 
 i was stunned as she <unk> and fell on the floor 
 my clothes were wet with puke but weirdly did n't smell like anything 
 i yelled if anyone in the store can help me 
 alas it was very quiet as i was the only customer there 
 i yelled again is there anyone in the back '' 
 no answer 
 so i thought fuck it '' 
 i went to the cashier and brought her to the clinic 
 & gt doctor d : oh juvie you 're back 
 what 's <unk> god 
 the doctor was surprised with my <unk> clothes as i walked in the clinic 
 he then helped me carry the cashier lady to the patient bed 
 & gt d : what happened 
 & gt me : i was just shopping normally and then out of nowhere she just released a ton of her stomach content on me 
 he then examined her and said & gt d : looks like a stomach virus 
 thank you for bringing her here 
 some time passes and suddenly the store manager came over and saw the passed out cashier lady on the bed 
 the doctor and i explained the story to the store manager and his face was red with <unk> and guilt 
 he apologized and thanked me profusely he then offers me laundry cleaning for my clothes and a gift card 
 i thanked him and left them in the clinic since i have to get a water shower to clean myself 
 a month later i went back to the clinic for my medical check-up for my <unk> medicine 
 as i walked in the clinic i saw the next door convenience store cashier lady holding a bouquet of flowers sitting on the waiting chair 
 she jumped to me and thanked me a lot for saving her then gave me the bouquet of flowers 
 i 'm touched she does n't have to but she insisted 
 she thanked me again and again 
 and that 's the story on how i get covered in vomit 
 edit : turned out she was the one insisting to work and the store manager was very worried that she might get sick again 
 he was in the storage room while the accident happened 
 when he goes to the front and saw the sea of vomit he immediately ran to the clinic searching for the cashier lady 
 edit 2 : she went to the clinic and asked whether if i might go there again and the doctor gave away my ~~monthly check-up <unk> 
 apparently she wanted to thank me for saving her so he gave her my next appointment 
 hello again tfr 
 i posted a story a couple of days ago from my time working at a deli 
 while some crazy things happened every now and then this is by far the craziest thing that has every happened to me while working there 
 please bear with me as this will be a little long 
 this particular day i was working a double shift as a delivery driver 
 it was a couple of hours until my first shift ended and two deliveries got called in 
 one delivery was pretty close to our location and the other was a little farther but still a pretty short drive 
 <unk> i think to myself 
 *i 'll take the farther one and drop of the closer one on the way back 
 * i came to find out that i 'm glad i made that decision 
 everything goes relatively smoothly 
 i drop off the first one arrive at the second and knock on the door 
 i immediately hear what sounds like a small child yelling 
 <unk> 
 <unk> '' 
 *no <unk> i think 
 <unk> kid was <unk> and probably fell down 
 i 'm sure their mom will be here shortly and answer the <unk> 
 so i wait 
 and wait 
 and wait some more 
 i knock again and the screaming picks back up 
 wait a minute or two the screaming <unk> 
 knock again the screaming picks up 
 my mind starts to race 
 <unk> the mom will be here right 
 did she fall asleep 
 is she even there 
 * by now every time i knock the screaming gets more and more desperate 
 like someone is in some serious pain 
 i even tried opening the door but it was locked 
 i mull it over in my head a bit and finally decide on what i need to do 
 i 'll call 911. even if it is n't an emergency at least i can have the peace of mind that it was n't anything bad 
 as an aside i 've hardly ever called 911 so i was extremely nervous and it took a lot to convince myself to call 
 i call the dispatcher and tell them what 's going on 
 i tell them that there 's what sounds like a child yelling in this house and they inform me that there 's a unit close by who 's on the way 
 within 60 seconds a police cruiser comes down the road 
 he comes up and i tell him what i told the dispatcher 
 he knocks and hears the screaming 
 tries to get into the house but no avail so he goes around to the back 
 by this point a second cop shows up 
 and a third 
 the first cop comes back to the front and tells me that he was able to speak to the person screaming through the back door 
 turns out it was an older lady not a kid like i thought 
 shortly after he tells me this a fire truck and an ambulance come blaring down the road 
 fuck 
 this might be pretty bad 
 even worse was the fact that i parked in the <unk> of this house and the ambulance blocked me in forcing me to stay 
 the <unk> rush up to the door and bust it down 
 the paramedics rushed in after them along with the cops 
 so now i 'm outside by myself waiting for them to finish ... whatever it is they 're doing so i can finally leave and get back to work 
 the entire time i 'm worried that something is seriously wrong and felt helpless throughout the whole thing 
 finally the paramedics come out with someone on a stretcher and load them up into the ambulance 
 one of the cops comes up to me and informs me that the lady living in this house recently has hip surgery and while she was walking around the house she somehow <unk> her hip leaving her <unk> and in a lot of pain 
 he told me it was a good thing i called since she had been there for a while and who knows how much longer she could have been stuck there 
 he gives me a congratulatory pat on the back everyone loads up and leaves and i finally make my way back to the deli 
 i get there cash out and go on my much needed break 
 **epilogue** - later on during the night shift the husband of the woman came in to pick up the food from earlier 
 as my coworker was helping him she pointed me out as the one who called 911 
 you 're the one who did that '' 
 yes sir 
 i was really worried that something serious happened ... '' he <unk> at me shakes my hand while thanking me profusely and hands me a few bucks for the trouble 
 in all honesty he did n't even have to tip me 
 just his face and reaction was a good enough tip for me 
 a customer comes up to the fitting room with me asking about three leggings she found in the clearance section 
 two of them were marked down for $ 8 while the other was still full price at $ <unk> 
 i knew where this was going to go because it has happened before 
 a manager comes up listens to the customer and then makes the customer happy by taking the price down of that one to match the others 
 a <unk> among <unk> this did n't happen 
 i called for a manager 
 one of them told me to tell the customer yadda yadda 
 i told them i already told the customer that and they still want to speak with a manager 
 one of the co managers shows up and listens to the customer 
 while doing this she also looks over the items and notices the <unk> are very different because they are from different series from the manufacturer 
 she tells this to the customer and that therefore it is n't discounted 
 customer tried to argue but was still <unk> 
 i stood there in disbelief 
 i could n't believe i heard that 
 the co manager walked away leaving me to deal with the customer again 
 she was pissed and asked for the corporate number 
 i gave her the 1800 number 
 sure enough within 15 minutes corporate called and i forwarded them to management 
 the conversation between managers over the walkie was yadda yadda store discretion and it is n't going to happen and also something about the lady sitting in the parking lot 
 i had myself a little giggle saw my meal break replacement shows up so i went to dinner 
 i had me some wings and a <unk> soda 
 have a great day 
 *edit : i made it to the front page 
 thanks to everyone 
 *this happened to me in my first job and i still to this day do n't understand how the customer settled for my suggestion 
 i used to work in a chain of stores that sold baskin and robbins ice cream if you 've never tasted baskin and robbins it is literally the best ice cream you 're going to get 
 the price was fairly expensive but compared to other brands like ben and <unk> it was considerably cheaper even more so if i 've scooped it for you as i always over-scooped 
 at the time we had this offer on for a cherry milkshake which was £2 usually £3.50 
 there were signs clearly posted which just said something along the lines of try our cherry milkshake <unk> offer £2 
 so a guy comes to my counter and orders a cotton candy milkshake he pays and goes and sits in our <unk> area everything is fine with the world 
 10 minutes later he comes back with this half drunk milkshake and slams it on the counter and clicks at me to get my attention 
 customer - i paid £3.50 for this milkshake and that sign there says they 're £2 '' 
 me - we 're having an offer our new cherry flavour ice cream the special off price is only available for the cherry ice cream unfortunately '' customer - i do n't like cherry and well i feel like i 've been ripped off what are you going to do to resolve it 
 ca n't you make my milkshake £2 '' me - i 'm sorry you feel that way but unfortunately it 's only the cherry ice cream which is £2 what would you suggest '' 
 customer - i want a milkshake for £2 '' 
 me - well i will be happy to make you a cherry milkshake for £2 and i can offer you a 20 % discount on a box of 12 cookies as well '' this guys face turns so smug he agrees and pays for his items then leaves with another milkshake and a box of cookies spending an additional <unk> 
 so all in all he paid <unk> for items he did n't actually want 
 i wonder how long it took him to realise what he had done 
 sir you 've just been served by the best my friend 
 i used to work in <unk> sales management for a random mvno 
 one day we had a customer return to us complaining about a large bill that she had received telling us that she does n't use her phone enough to rack up the bill 
 being a good manager i sat down with her to go through the bill to determine where the issue is 
 at the time data services had become a big thing and i assumed that 's where it would be coming from 
 nope 
 the lady had a list of thousands of sms sent in a single month 
 & gt me : well it looks as though you 've been sending more text messages than you normally would 
 & gt customer : no that ca n't be right 
 i did n't send these messages 
 i 'm being charged twice for every message 
 & gt me : i see those they are because you 've asked for proof that each message has been received 
 but none of those are charged on your bill the problem is related to the thousands of text messages that were sent 
 & gt customer : i did n't send these messages 
 i want to be refunded for this 
 i 've never spent so much on a phone bill in my life 
 i spent two hours with her going through each message on the bill finding the number they were sent to and matching it up with the messages on her phone 
 it was n't until i had gone through every single sms and proved to her that she had sent each message that she admitted that her <unk> for the month was higher than normal 
 at that point she stormed out without so much as a thank you 
 and then i just shake my head and move on to the next customer 
 **update : the community helped to raise over $ <unk> for the family 
 it is n't much in the grand scheme of things but it will be a big help in this first month or so 
 the raffles the neighboring butcher and produce market also provided platters 
 have been drawn and winners given their platters and we still have customers opening their hearts and <unk> 
 i 'm going to push to make this an annual thing to celebrate our coworker 's life and bring the community together 
 ** you guys may remember my post about my co-worker dying suddenly 
 team morale is pretty much at zero <unk> is underway for team members and the funeral is this week 
 the entire store is going which means we 're pulling from all stores nearby to cover 
 i still think a coworker 's death and funeral should warrant a day of <unk> but hey 
 we 've started letting regular customers know what happened 
 the majority of regular customers we have are wonderful all very caring about the store and staff - some were just as devastated as we were 
 she left behind two daughters who are <unk> finding it very hard to <unk> find their feet so we 've thrown a <unk> weekend 
 <unk> sausage sizzle raffles all approved and supplied by the company and donation cans on each register an explanation taped around the can 
 they all read : & gt recently we 've lost a team member and friend 
 all proceeds will go directly to ____ 's daughters to assist them in this difficult time 
 we thank you for your patience regarding this shock loss 
 most people have been curious by the cans and read it then talked to us about it and/or donated anything they could 
 i almost cried when an elderly lady pulled out a $ 50 bill and handed it to me to put in the can 
 today a middle-aged couple offered <unk> work 
 then i started serving a guy with his girlfriend 
 ignored me when i greeted them 
 he took one glance at the can and laughed at it saying look they want more money from us '' 
 before i could say anything he continues do n't they get enough money or something 
 sheesh 
 i bet it goes straight to their pockets 
 does it '' 
 & gt me : no i- & gt guy : oh 
 <unk> to <unk> yeah right 
 & gt me : it 's <unk> & gt guy : going to your pocket 
 is it a tip jar 
 & gt me : no tips are illegal 
 & gt guy : so it is going to company 
 you 're feeding their greed 
 & gt <unk> : *-reads the can gets a horrified <unk> i 'm pissed 
 really pissed 
 i may have <unk> a line but at this point i did n't care 
 dude was being insensitive her death is still a very raw pain in the store 
 coworkers are still crying and <unk> 
 if he had bothered to read the tag on the can he 'd know 
 so i shoved his own foot in his big mouth 
 & gt me : *-picks up <unk> it 's for our coworker who died last weekend 
 we 're sending all donations to her daughters to give some financial assistance 
 company is getting none of this nor am i. the sausage sizzle <unk> and cans are all for her daughters 
 his face went from a smirk to total dejection and i finished serving in total silence 
 did n't say their total did n't ask if they wanted cash back did n't bid them good day 
 tl dr : customer accuses me and store of <unk> donations 
 donations are for dead coworker 's grieving <unk> run a small <unk> for an independent pharmacy 
 it 's a sweet job : both challenging and satisfying and the customers are generally very nice and grateful 
 so a couple weeks ago this young lady stops by clearly upset 
 apparently she went to a certain national electronics store for passport photos 
 she ended up buying two sets from them 
 in the first set she did n't like how they looked but they would n't provide a free <unk> which i 'll gladly do so she pays for it 
 the 2nd time she was satisfied with how she looked but the passport lady at the post office said they would be rejected by the feds for several reasons 
 she went in to get a refund and they said ... “oh she 's just being picky 
 we wo n't give you a refund for this.” how dumb is that 
 her job is <unk> that <unk> are accepted by the feds 
 of course she 'll maintain high standards that 's her fucking job 
 plus i saw the photos in question i ca n't believe they would let those photos go out the door 
 so that 's $ 30 bucks she 's not getting back for a service that was never properly rendered 
 ended up taking her passport photo and giving it to her for free cause that 's ridiculous 
 she ended up writing a great review for the lab online 
 i hope the other guys continue to do the same work cause i love taking their business 
 edit : formatting edit # 2 : ahhhhhh 
 i drank some beer and went into <unk> only to wake up to lovely comments and delicious karma 
 thanks for making my day guys 
 imma try to answer some of these questions now 
 edit # 3 : here is what my brother said in regards to the what happened to the guy who got a refund in pennies 
 yes he did 
 it was <unk> pennies 56 pounds of them 
 guy who got refund rolled them and took them to the bank 
 captain of ship and i tried to get him to give them to a friend to buy something from national chain and pay in pennies 
 guy who got refund is banned from the <unk> '' 
 i also know the refund was n't rendered till a couple months later so i have a feeling that guy-who-got-refund was pretty sick of it in the <unk> work in a small video game store 
 had a family of three come in last night mom two kids 
 one of the kids was shopping the other was sick to his stomach 
 he walked around the store <unk> at least 8 different times all over the floor and the mom did not even bat an <unk> 
 after puke # 8 she took him out of the store to put him into the car then came back in to shop with the other kid 
 she did not apologize and then we had to close the entire store for a few hours while we cleaned up the nastiest little kid vomit in the world 
 <unk> to parents : i do n't really care if your kid is sick though i prefer that he is n't ... but if i 'm going to spend three hours of my life cleaning up his bodily fluids least you can do is act like you 're sorry about it.now i do n't have the price of every item in the shop memorized - particularly ones that are n't bought very often 
 this man in particular wanted to check the price of a bottled drink 
 i reach out to scan it of course after hitting the <unk> query option on the register 
 & gt me : sure just let me scan it - he holds it out of reach 
 & gt customer : no no i 'm not buying it 
 i just want to know the price 
 & gt me : i know i just need to scan it to check - & gt customer : i do n't want to buy it 
 & gt me : i know but i need to scan it to get the price - & gt customer : i just need to know how much it is 
 i 'm not buying it 
 i sort of give up at this point 
 i just smile slightly at him 
 & gt me : i know 
 & gt customer : listen 
 i do n't want to buy this 
 & gt me : yes 
 & gt customer : i just need to know how much it costs 
 & gt me : yes 
 & gt customer : then i 'll decide if i want to buy it 
 & gt me : yes 
 & gt customer : i 'm not going to buy it yet 
 & gt me : yes 
 & gt customer : so i just need the price 
 & gt me : yes 
 the entire time i 'm just smiling and nodding and <unk> 
 finally he gets this look of <unk> on his face 
 & gt customer : ... you need to scan it to check the price 
 & gt me : <unk> 
 thing is i 'm pretty sure he had good intentions since me having to void it out would only have hurt me and honestly not much 
 i found it more funny than it was frustrating but <unk> 
 this story happened tonight at the time it boiled my blood and pissed me off 
 now i just pity this guy so much 
 so i work at the front desk of a nice hotel am a supervisor and am competent enough to be the manager on duty each of my shifts 
 so i am working tonight the night is n't terribly difficult training a new employee high amount of guests checking in 
 an older gentleman comes to the front desk and asks for change for a $ 20 
 he <unk> that he needs $ 18 in dollars and the remaining $ 2 in coins 
 i comply and he asks for the closest pay phone 
 i direct him to one in the lobby and can tell this is n't going to end well 
 the gentleman comes back a minute later saying the pay phone did not work and he wants his money back 
 i tell him that directions are on the pay phone to request a refund and sadly we were not responsible for a refund since this a third party service 
 he asks me to come assist him with attempting to get his refund 
 i tell him to dial the refund line and to request a refund 
 this is where he loses his cool and begins to spout off that he is old and needs help 
 i calmly ask him to please calm down and to tell me the story 
 he says he deposited $ 1.50 made his call and the phone rang and went to voicemail 
 i tell him okay well did you record a message 
 he answers yes he did but the call was n't picked up 
 i tell him well it was picked up by the voice mail service and i am sorry that he was not connected to a human being but got a voice mail service 
 this <unk> him and he starts yelling i tell him okay i will navigate the menu prompts 
 i navigate the menu and finally get to the last stage of the menu where the phone company will review the issue and if it is machine error they will mail a check for a whole $ 1.50 anywhere in the world 
 the guy loses his cool and yells that they will not send a check to china for him 
 i tell him that they said it will be mailed and to please record his name and mailing address 
 he goes bananas and says why ca n't he just get his refund 
 i tell him this is the way this company handles refunds and that we are not liable for refunds 
 now the pay phone message system shuts down and no message was recorded 
 the pay phone shuts down and will not be back up and running until a technician resets it and makes sure it is in working order 
 the guy loses it saying why is this so difficult 
 i tell him it is not difficult and to calm down 
 he goes off how the machine is in our hotel that we should bear some of the burden 
 i ask him okay our atm is in the building if it <unk> you incorrect amounts are we liable for the machine 
 he says well no you are n't 
 i tell him exactly it is in our building but it is not our responsibility for a <unk> 
 i tell him sir you left a voice mail you wanted to talk your party but they did not pick up so please calm down 
 he pleads and begs for his money back 
 i ask him if he was going to starve without this $ 1.50 
 he says no 
 i ask him if this is his last $ 1.50 
 i ask him if this will ruin his finances 
 he answers no to every question 
 i open my wallet and retrieve two crisp dollar bills and tell him this wo n't ruin me either 
 i hand him the dollars and ask for the fifty cents 
 this guy looks like a ghost i shove the $ 2.00 in his hands hold my hand out and he drops the two quarters into my hand 
 i ask him if he is happy 
 he nods silently i tell him great now please realize i will not be <unk> for this $ 1.50 but this will not matter to me in a year month day or hour 
 so why let it get you down 
 why let it affect you to make you yell act uncivil or ruin your day 
 he says nothing at all 
 i tell him well you got your refund the phone is locked out of service and you can not use the phone at all so have a good night 
 he walks away realizing how big of an ass he was 
 all of this for $ 1.50 
 making one person realize how petty they were for $ 1.50 is priceless 
 update : so the guest who is still staying at the hotel came up to me last night and said one of the most <unk> things ever 
 i am sorry i acted that way 
 it was petty to be angry over something so small 
 would you like your money back '' 
 i told him do n't worry about it shook his hand and left it at that with a smile 
 maybe i changed his thinking that night 
 who knows so i was working another night shift at a little sandwich shop inside of a gas station 
 i had been quiet for a while after the lunch rush was over when a young couple came in 
 i made their sandwiches without incident they spent most of the time talking to each other instead of paying attention to the food but thats pretty normal 
 i wrap everything up and start punching in the register 
 i give them their total and the girl tries to pay exact giving me some bills and change 
 i count all of the money and she is fifty cents short 
 she opens her wallet again but it is empty 
 then she looks at my tip jar next to the register 
 working in a gas station with a tip jar we get exactly as much crap happening to it as youd expect 
 we never make much maybe an extra five to ten bucks a night but its a good pick me up 
 about once a week our less <unk> customers take out of it when we <unk> looking but thats probably the worst 
 so when this girl locked eyes on the quarters in the bottom of my jar and tried to reach for them i was pretty mentally prepared to tell her that she can not take from my tip jar and give her the quarters 
 i usually use the spare change to help people who are legitimately short anyway 
 but then another hand came down and slapped hers out of the way 
 i look back up and her boyfriend is looking at her with shock 
 bitch this is a goddamn tip jar not a change jar show some respect '' 
 he looks back at me thanks me hands me two bucks grabs the food and walks away with his girlfriend in tow 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven 
 **story : ** we offer an <unk> no dud guarantee on everything we sell 
 basically if it does n't work bring it back and we 'll replace it or give you your money back 
 we occasionally have items returned but it does n't happen very often 
 the morning after nye one of our regulars showed up for a return 
 he was moving pretty slow and was <unk> an obvious hangover 
 he wanted to return our 16,000 firecracker roll because it was a dud 
 he was pretty bummed since this was supposed to be the big midnight finale at his friends house 
 i was immediately confused since i have no idea how 16,000 firecrackers could have all been bad 
 i told him we would take care of it and asked him if it had gotten wet 
 he told me that it just wouldn’t light no matter how hard they tried and it was in the back of his car if we wanted to check it out 
 now this particular roll is packaged to look like a giant firecracker with a piece of rope coming out of the top to <unk> a fuse like this at the base of the rope are pictures and written directions explaining how to <unk> the package to get to the real fuse 
 you can then roll it out so the firecrackers go off individually or light it as a bundle with all 16,000 firecrackers going off in about a minute 
 to prove his point he pulled out his phone to show my dad and i a video they had taken of him trying to light it 
 in the video he was obviously <unk> and was stumbling around with a lighter trying to light **the piece of green <unk> 
 i could hear people laughing in the background and <unk> him on as they had <unk> him trying to drunkenly light a piece of rope for 5 minutes 
 as we’re watching the video i’m dying inside and trying to think of a nice way to tell him what his mistake was 
 suddenly he paused the video slowly looked up at us and said **cust : ** that’s not really the fuse is it 
 **me : ** starting to chuckle nope 
 **cust : ** those <unk> 
 **me : ** dying laughing now look i’ll give you your money back and give you another one for free if you’ll send me that video 
 i think he considered it for a second but then he figured out that i was definitely going to post the video on my website 
 hell i’d have given him triple his money back for a copy of that video 
 he quickly hit the delete button and shook his head no 
 i tried to give him his money back but he wouldn’t accept it 
 he asked us to check out the firecracker roll in his car to make sure it was still good and my dad walked out to check on it with him 
 my dad was laughing when he walked back into the tent and let me in on the joke 
 after my dad had peeled back the paper and showed the guy where the real fuse was the guy thanked my dad and casually mentioned his plans 
 he was now on his way to buy a big metal garbage can and then planned to stop by his <unk> house to say good <unk> one just happened 
 on mobile/forgive formatting 
 so i 'm waiting in line at my favorite coffee place for my daily dose of caffeine 
 it 's semi-busy at this time of morning when the <unk> rush is just ending 
 so i 'm the last person in a fairly short line 
 refill guy comes up <unk> the line and demands the cashier still helping another customer refill his tiny little coffee 
 cashier tells him that store policy is that he ca n't cut the line he needs to wait like everyone else and to please return to the end of the line 
 refill guy gets really angry at this point starts yelling that he has never had to wait before ever 
 and that this is n't their corporate policy 
 cashier explains very patiently that they are <unk> owned and that the owner <unk> that everyone go through the line to make things fair for all customers 
 refill guy reluctantly takes his place in line behind me grumbling about how unfair it is how he 's going to demand a manager who was actually standing behind cashier filling orders when she told the customer to wait in line in the first place and so on getting himself really worked up in the short wait in line 
 it looked like it took a lot of the wind out of his sails when he finally got his turn to get his precious refill and ended up at the same cashier 
 who politely served him as though he had n't been a complete a $ $ a few seconds ago 
 silently took his refill and slunk back into the table area to <unk> his <unk> the pet store for returns over $ 25 without a receipt you need to show id drivers licences state id passport military and even foreign ids are all ok 
 their name and address are put into the system to keep an eye out for fraud 
 you can guess how this went over 
 me : ok and because you do n't have a receipt and the return is $ 50 i 'll need to see your id 
 customer : just do the damn return 
 me : i cant even managers cant over ride the system 
 customer : i do n't have one drivers licences are a government conspiracy 
 me : *picks up <unk> customer : wha ... what are you doing 
 me : calling the police i saw you drive in here and you just told me you do n't have a drivers license 
 customer : wait 
 i have one i have one 
 *pulls out <unk> me : *finishes <unk> you and have a nice <unk> short one for you guys 
 this happened last year 
 i was working customer service and a woman who looked like bea <unk> comes up for an exchange 
 & gt me pointing to my register : okay ma'am i 'll grab you down there 
 she looks me dead in the eye and says & gt you 'd better not grab me down there 
 i stare at her 
 she stares at me 
 i stare back at her 
 she stares back at me 
 we bust out laughing 
 funniest thirty seconds of my life 
 edit : autocorrect edit : i do n't know who gave me gold 
 but i will find him 
 and i will thank him 
 because he 's the hero tfr deserves but not the one it needs right now 
 so we 'll hunt him 
 because he can take it 
 because he 's not our hero 
 he 's a silent lurker a watchful gilder 
 a cool <unk> post : i got a phone call this afternoon around 1 of the clock from my account manager telling me that i needed to report to the district office immediately 
 so i rolled out of bed <unk> shaved put clothes on and drove off into the city 
 i was greeted at the secretary 's desk by the manager and told to follow him into the district manager 's dm from here on office where dm was waiting for me with a stack of paperwork 
 *fuck my life i bet this is gent 's doing * i thought to myself 
 i stuck out my hand to shake dm 's hand and he rather rudely refused barking at me to sit down 
 i bit my tongue and <unk> 
 i 'm going to get straight to the point keiblerclown : we received two seperate phone calls from members at coastal yacht club about an incident several nights ago in which you were reported as being rude obnoxious and confrontational to a mr. gent 
 this type of behavior <unk> <unk> security company 's code of <unk> and we have zero tolerance for it 
 do you have anything to say in your defense before you receive your disciplinary hearing '' 
 my jaw bounced off dm 's desk on it 's way to the floor this could n't be fucking happening 
 i wiped the sudden sweat from my brow and said i did have an encounter with a mr. gent several nights ago but it did n't happen the way you just described it 
 <unk> <unk> was the rude obnoxious and confrontational one 
 i 'd go as far as to say he was entirely belligerent 
 and i have no clue who this second person is supposed to be because mr. gent was alone during our ... encounter '' 
 well keiblerclown that 's a nice story but it 's your word against two '' 
 actually i do have a witness who will corroborate that mr. gent was both alone and belligerent 
 her name is - '' do n't lie to me 
 i know damn well you work alone on an overnight shift '' 
 it was st. patrick 's day and the club was <unk> a party later than they normally close 
 i placed a phone call from my office to the business office and spoke to barbara the event manager who *heard* mr. gent go off on a <unk> 
 i 'm fairly certain that she can verify whether or not he was alone or not as well 
 actually mr. gent would have been seen on camera coming to and leaving my office 
 they can check the footage '' 
 dm was silent for a moment before asking my manager to sit in and watch me what the actual fuck 
 while he stepped out to make some phone calls 
 roughly 30 minutes pass in terribly awkward silence before dm comes back in and immediately apologizes for the misunderstanding 
 apparently barbara had not only <unk> my story but several other employees throughout that night had reported gent 's <unk> 
 he had actually been with a guest the same in fact who had made the second complaint against me but that guest had left roughly an hour before my shift had even started 
 the best part is that the general manager at the yacht club will begin processing the paperwork to <unk> gent 's membership and will be <unk> it to every other club they are affiliated with 
 justice 
 the grouchy bastard damn near had me but it was my helpful phone call to barbara that saved my ass in the end 
 i need to buy her dinner or something holy <unk> fit 
 tl dr : gent attempts to fuck me over ends up fucking himself over even harder 
 edit : i should proof read before <unk> you for shopping at hypermarket 
 kindly go die in a fire 
 all my fellow retail workers know the glorious feeling that accompanies a jackass customer being slapped down 
 whether you yourself get to deliver the <unk> de grace to their ego or you merely watch someone else do it there are few things quite as satisfying as bearing witness to a righteous verbal smackdown against an <unk> customer 
 come step <unk> the <unk> machine and i will take you back to such an event in the <unk> days of 2008. it was an average day in my little <unk> of u-scan until royal jerkface called me over for help 
 he had a coupon and it was n't scanning 
 the following conversation is an approximation of what i can remember since this happened almost six years ago 
 his final line though is 100 % accurate as is what follows that 
 **me** : oh well these machines do n't actually scan the coupons sir 
 i have to do that for you '' 
 **rj** : well that 's fucking stupid '' 
 **me** : <unk> sigh* just let me take that coupon for you sir and i 'll get this taken care of '' 
 he handed me the coupon and i felt myself die a little inside 
 it was expired by over a month 
 **me** : i 'm terribly sorry sir but this coupon is expired 
 i 'm afraid i ca n't take it '' 
 **rj** : what 
 that 's bullshit 
 i 've used these coupons here before '' 
 **me** : yes but this one is expired 
 it 's no good anymore '' 
 **rj** : whatever 
 just give me my money off '' 
 **me** : i 'm sorry but i ca n't '' 
 **rj** : yes you can 
 you have to '' 
 **me** : no sir i really ca n't 
 company policy does not allow us to accept expired coupons '' 
 **rj** : this is crap 
 i know you can take this 
 it 's your job 
 do your job and do it <unk> you vapid <unk> '' 
 i was stunned 
 nobody have ever actually called me such a thing before and to have that particularly vile word <unk> at me over <unk> <unk> <unk> caught me so <unk> that my mind went completely blank 
 i could think of no way to respond 
 fortunately i did n't have to 
 during my exchange with royal jerkface i had n't noticed the customer that <unk> up to the next machine waiting for me to finish up with jerkface 
 it was my big brother 
 my big brother is not my big '' brother just because he 's older than me 
 he is <unk> '' has broad shoulders and at that time had just come home from a summer spent working as a wildland firefighter so he was in quite good shape 
 he 's also somewhat comically protective of me 
 before the snap of the t '' at the end of the offending word had finished echoing off the u-scan machines my brother had closed the distance between himself and rj 
 he <unk> a hand down on rj 's shoulder spun him around leaned down to rj 's eye level rj was <unk> shorter than him and <unk> what did you just say to *my little sister* '' 
 rj went white 
 his face *had* been the scarlet of a person so angry you fear or hope they may burst an important vessel somewhere but one look into my brother 's eyes and the color just drained out of him 
 he stood for a moment staring at my brother in <unk> fear his mouth opening and closing but producing no sound ... and then he turned and <unk> out of the store 
 at that point i laughed so hard that i cried 
 it was glorious it was the most perfect thing i had ever seen 
 and as a bonus neither hide nor hair of rj was ever seen in the store again 
 **tl dr - do not taunt happy fun brother 
 **this actually happened over the course of two weeks but anyway ... the shop i work in has among other things a selection of furniture 
 now we do n't have a huge amount of space so we often have to order things and especially for the largest items 
 it also means that customers can have things <unk> if they buy in store we have no delivery service so they have to transport items themselves 
 two weeks or so ago an elderly lady came in and asked about furniture 
 we did n't have the item in stock so i suggested that she could place an order online 
 i asked her if she 'd like it if we did via the stores order system or whether she 'd like to set up an online account 
 it went something like this : & gt **me** : ok we can do this two ways 
 i can put the order through our internal system or you can create your own account here now so you can order things at home yourself 
 & gt <unk> <unk> : oh i 'm a bit unsure about computers ... & gt **me** : do n't worry it 's very easy to do 
 in fact we can both sit at the computer and i 'll guide you through the whole thing 
 i 'm really good with computers myself so i can assure you that nothing will go wrong 
 plus if you can do this you can do any shopping online they 're all pretty similar 
 she seemed happy with this so off we went to the back room where the customer computer was 
 now what i did in this case was rather than doing all the inputting myself i got this lady to do it herself with me explaining everything to her in a sort of <unk> way 
 it took a few minutes to create an account and then i showed her how to place and pay for an order before printing the confirmation and writing it in the order book 
 she then went off pleased with everything 
 skip forward to today and said lady came in again doing more shopping 
 she came to my till and obviously <unk> me and said : & gt lady : oh you showed me about shopping online 
 you know after you 'd explained it to me like you did i went home and gave it a shot and you were right it was easy 
 my granddaughter thinks i 'm great because i bought her birthday present online and i even managed to work out how to send it straight to her house 
 so yes i introduced an elderly customer to online shopping and made her day 
 **hijabedit : thank you for the gold 
 **so this just happened 40 mins ago and i still do n't know what went through that lady 's head 
 i work in a stall in the middle of a hallway in a mall so we have no gate and no <unk> signs of being closed but for the fact that all the lights are off a sign that explicitly states we are closed and our opening hours and that all the other stores around are obviously closed 
 we open at 9 on <unk> 
 now when i got to my stall this morning it was around 8:35. largely enough time for me to turn on the registers and do everything i needed to do for the stall to open at 9. a lady was sitting on the bench in front of the stall tapping her foot 
 i did n't worry about her since a lot of people sit there waiting for the bigger stores around us to open 
 however as soon as i entered my stall she jumped up and came to me 
 excuse me 
 miss 
 you 're late '' 
 i knew i was n't but i still looked at my watch 
 8:35 
 i 'm sorry ma'am but we do n't open until 9 - no 
 you 're late '' 
 still <unk> i somehow wondered if she was right 
 i checked my watch again 
 <unk> ok at least i knew i was n't crazy 
 i 'm sorry ma'am but as i told you we open at 9. i would be happy to help you then - this is unacceptable 
 you are late and you wo n't even admit it '' 
 as you can see ma'am it is only <unk> '' i showed her my watch but it did nothing to cool the fury of this righteous customer lady 
 but you 're late 
 you have to be there when i arrive 
 you have to open right away when i arrive '' 
 i could only stare at her 
 it was way too early in the morning to explain basic rules of retail to a lady well in her <unk> 
 she <unk> upon the usual rant of 'this is horrible customer service 
 i 'll never come back here 
 etc. etc. before finally leaving 
 it is now 9:15 and i 'm not sure if she will come back today 
 edit : it is currently <unk> and she has just left the stall 
 no she did not actually buy whatever it was she wanted to buy this morning but only wanted to tell me how much of a terrible person i am and how i should n't be 'allowed to work 
 i ca n't say i expected much <unk> went to visit my dad today 
 he wanted me to bring my dog so he could hang out with her for a couple of hours while i got my hair done and ran a couple of errands 
 when i got back he asked me if i remember telling him about how crappy my day was at work at my old job and i would sometimes get a tip from a customer which would cheer me up 
 & gt me : sure i remember 
 & gt dad : i think you 'll be proud of me 
 i went to get lunch at chicken place he goes to often and there was a new girl working the front 
 the people in front of me had a really big order and they were making the order really confusing for her 
 she asked her coworkers for help but they ignored her or told her she 's got ta be able to figure it out on her own 
 she kinda reminded me of you when you were younger and she looked like she was about to cry 
 she ended up getting the order for them done and when it was my turn i told her she did a good job getting my meal for me and i tipped her $ 5 
 & gt me : oh cool 
 yeah that was really nice of you could you tell it brightened her day 
 & gt dad : yeah she was really surprised 
 it made my cold retail heart a little less <unk> today 
 it 'll be back tomorrow i already got two emails about a customer with a cluster of an issue to fix 
 just thought i 'd share been working as a shift manager at a retail store for about a year now 
 recently moved across the country and transferred stores this happened a couple weeks into my time at the new store 
 a young girl probably 12-13 comes in with her mother she says she left her wallet in the bathroom and asks if any have been turned in 
 i tell her nothing has been turned in but i take her phone number so that if it shows up i can give her a call 
 she and her mom search around the store for it to no avail then a fellow shopper suggests they look in the trash for it 
 they come to me and ask me to look for it in the trash can outside not my favorite task in the world but she seems pretty upset so i get some gloves and start digging 
 what do you know i actually find the wallet 
 very pleased with myself i bring it to her but she opens it up and all her money is gone i mean it was in the trash obviously someone else found it first 
 this is where it got weird 
 & gt her : there was like $ 40 in here though 
 & gt me : yea i 'm sorry to hear that i wish i could help more & gt her : well can i at least get my money back 
 & gt me : ... no ... we did n't lose your wallet you did & gt her mom : but she forgot it at your store 
 & gt me : unfortunately there is nothing i can do i ca n't give you money because your daughter lost track of her own money & gt her mom : well that is ridiculous 
 we are going to call corporate on you 
 somebody is responsible for this 
 & gt me : i agree your daughter is responsible for this 
 & gt her mom : you will be hearing from us 
 then they stormed out of the store never to be seen or heard from again.this happened a few years ago while i was working in the electronics department at a big box retailer 
 this guy and his girlfriend both around <unk> years old comes up to me and say they want to buy a few things including a 50+ inch tv and were wondering if we took checks 
 the dude straight up hands me his checkbook and without even needing to put a detective hat on i could tell it was stolen 
 both the <unk> number and account number were lazily altered with a pen and they had crossed off the persons address at the top 
 i was not much older than either of them so my first thought is they are trying to get me to go along with their scheme 
 being that i do n't know these people and have zero reason to help them with crime i decide to play along 
 i let them know that we absolutely take checks as long as one of them has a valid id 
 i excuse myself to the back explaining that i need to see if we have the tv they wanted in stock and they should have a look around to see if there was anything else they wanted to buy while i checked 
 at the time i had zero sympathy for these people 
 they were both dressed like their families were well-off this store was in one of the more wealthy suburbs and the whole thing seemed like they felt so entitled they were just going to steal from someone to get whatever they wanted 
 i head to the back and immediately call an assistant manager and let them know what 's going on 
 he says try and stall them for a few minutes get them everything they want and when they are ready to check out make some excuse about needing to bring them up to the front registers 
 i bring the tv out on a cart and find they have decided i seem cool and was going to let them use a stolen check so they now want a load of random crap dvd 's surround system etc 
 i spend something like 30 minutes with them going over the differences in all the console gaming systems have them look at laptops cameras and all kinds of other junk 
 they are excited by all the stuff they are going to buy and after filling a shopping cart they are ready to check out 
 we get to the front check out and the assistant manager has put on a cashier 's vest and is waiting at a closed check out line for us 
 i <unk> us to his line and he starts ringing everybody up 
 he gets to the total which i think was somewhere in the $ 7,500+ range they write a check and he asks for id 
 the girlfriend hands over a license with a 50 year old woman 's picture on it but with the same name as on the check 
 without missing a beat the assistant <unk> over three police officers who were standing at the entrance waiting for these two kids and arrest them 
 they were planning on grabbing them either way since they were reported as being in possession of stolen checks 
 because of these two i spent the rest of the evening writing up a detailed itemization of everything they were trying to purchase for the police report 
 i never found out what happened to them but i assume they were charged with a crime of some kind 
 they did n't seem to realize what was going on when i had someone else check them out and were totally blindsided when the police came up to arrest them 
 i know i could have probably just told them we ca n't accept their check when they first came up to me or maybe had a little chat with them about not committing <unk> 
 thinking back though even if i declined their attempt to use a fraudulent check they would have probably just tried the same thing somewhere else - and who knows whether this was actually the first time they tried it 
 i do feel a little bad helping them dig their own hole 
 but at the end of the day i just do n't think it 's cool to go up to a stranger at their job and expect them to help you with crime it 's pretty fucking rude 
 i was working a solo shift at the convenience store and a regular stopped in 
 we chatted for a few minutes and she asked for some items gatorade water sandwich and 2 bananas to be put in a separate bag which i soon found out was for one of the homeless people that regularly hung around the store 
 after the customer left and gave the guy the bag he waited until she left and came into the store 
 this exchange ensued : & gt me : may i help you 
 & gt him : *in a sincere <unk> yes the woman that just left gave me this bag of items and i would like to return them 
 & gt me : are there any issues with what you received 
 *i’m thinking along the lines of different flavors of gatorade or another type of <unk> & gt him : yes i want to return them for the cash so i can get beer instead 
 *at this i <unk> my head to the side and pretended to think about it* & gt me : no i can’t refund the money to you because you did n't originally purchase these items 
 & gt him : i’m being honest doesn’t that count for something 
 & gt me : not in this case because she bought these so you can have them not for you to turn back in for cash 
 *he leaves in an angry huff and tosses the bag against the window as he <unk> *i go outside to retrieve the bag and give it to one of the other homeless regulars that came in later that day that was appreciative for the sustenance* tldr : homeless person wants to return food items purchased by another customer so he can have cash for booze 
 edit : just got home from work and reading through the thread 
 thank you kind stranger for my first gilded post 
 10am on a saturday 
 customer approaching my till c : rough night last night 
 me : nope i was actually here last night and had a quiet night in 
 c : you look so hungover 
 me trying to not take it personally as a female who has to wear minimal make up to work : haha i was n't out or anything that 's strange 
 -i finish the transaction and he picks up his bags- c : anyway i hope you feel better later and can clean yourself up a bit 
 not the best thing for a customer to shout at you in a busy store when your floor manager is close by 
 thanks you horrible human 
 i work in a deli inside a supermarket and it 's not uncommon for customers to call ahead to place an order on sandwiches especially if it 's a large order unfortunately it 's less common than people just <unk> in and asking for the order to be made in front of them on no notice but that 's another story 
 i had just gotten to work at 11 am as my coworker left for lunch 
 my manager went to the back freezer so i was alone for a bit 
 up comes this lady in <unk> who greets me politely enough 
 & gt woman : hello i 'm here to pick up an order for 12 sandwiches '' 
 & gt me : okay one second let me find that for you '' 
 nobody told me about this order and it could be hiding in one of several places 
 i check the sandwich bar -- not there 
 not weird considering the amount 
 i check the quick-chill fridge -- not there either 
 hmm 
 i check the walk-in fridge -- nope 
 uh oh 
 where the hell are all these sandwiches 
 i start freaking out 
 i 've been yelled at by customers who have n't had their orders ready i 'm sure you have too 
 it 's not fun 
 i 'm not really in the mood for a good ol <unk> 
 i apologize to the woman and tell her i 'll call my manager surely she 'll know where they are 
 i go to call over the intercom for my manager to come back to the deli and as i 'm picking up the phone the woman starts laughing 
 like cracking up 
 luckily for me i paused and let her speak before i make the call 
 & gt '' i 'm just messing with you 
 there 's no sandwiches 
 you just looked like you would fall for that '' 
 i hang up the phone completely stunned nerves still racing from the fear of being screamed at 
 who the hell thinks that 's funny 
 in what way is that funny 
 what kind of maniac are you to get me all worked up and worried about that 
 what tipped you off that i would fall for that : '' the fact that i 'm fucking working and that 's my fucking job 
 of course i did n't scream that in her face as much as i wanted to 
 i just asked her : & gt me : can 
 i. get 
 you 
 anything '' 
 & gt woman : no thanks 
 you do n't hold <unk> do you '' 
 i have plenty of horrible stories but i figured i 'd start my first post with a positive one 
 warning : if you for some reason hate kids and everything they do even <unk> ones you probably wo n't enjoy this story 
 at my shoe store we have tablets where we can check people out look at our website order shoes for them etc 
 usually there are one or two associates on the floor with those tablets helping people out with those things 
 on this day i was working in women 's with the tablet 
 a women and her two kids a boy about aged 6-7 and a girl aged 4-5 enter our store from the elevator 
 the first thing i noticed were that the kids were on scooters 
 which was actually pretty cute 
 they just <unk> slowly behind their mom and were n't causing any trouble 
 i went over to ask the mother if she needed any help and it turns out the family was english and had accents which as an american is always unnecessarily exciting for me 
 the kids also had accents which was adorable 
 i 'm helping out the mother and using the tablet to look something up for her 
 as i 'm doing this the boy comes over and tries to see what i 'm doing 
 i bent down to show him what i was doing and talked through it 
 he watched with way more <unk> than i would ever expect it 's really not an interesting process and politely waited for me to finish what i was doing 
 after i let the mom know about her shoes the boy asks if he can see the tablet again and i show him the screen while i 'm still holding it 
 the conversation went as follows the words are n't exact but the content is the same 
 i will be me and the kid will be b. reminder this kid has a posh little english accent 
 & gt b : how go i get out of this 
 referring to the program i was using to look up shoes & gt me : exits program like this 
 & gt b : where are your games 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry bud but i do n't have any games on here 
 he looks at me with genuine concern like he seemed really worried for me 
 & gt b : they do n't let you have games 
 what do you do 
 & gt me : i have to work and help people 
 my boss would n't like it if i was playing games all day 
 & gt b : what about toys 
 & gt me : no i do n't get any toys either 
 & gt b : he touches my arm like a parent would to a child i 'm so sorry 
 at this point the mom was finished shopping and started taking the kids to leave 
 as they 're getting ready to leave the boy says to me i hope they let you have some fun '' 
 this interaction really made my day 
 i 've had kids before try and play games on my tablet but i 'd never had any of them feel bad for me when i told them i do n't have any 
 it was hilarious and adorable.my now previous employer has gone through some unfortunately <unk> bullshit in the last 2 weeks 
 basic mall retail store set up 1 store manager 1 ft assistant manager me 2 <unk> and a handful of sales associates 
 2 of our 4 <unk> can only work after 6 on weekdays and on weekends 
 one can only work weekends 
 the new girl we hired can work whenever but does n't have her own car so has to clear her schedule with her ride 
 pain in the ass but doable 
 the end of last month keyholder # 2 and i had to have several conversations about things like <unk> documents doing her job and how <unk> bank records is a big deal 
 because she got reprimanded she put in notice saying she 'd be leaving on the 14th 
 the next day she changed it to the 7th giving us 6 days notice 
 she called off her last shift 
 whatever we can run on a 3 member management for a while till we find a replacement 
 keyholder # 1 then had a whole slew of issues and is currently in the hospital for unknown reasons and for an unknown length of time 
 okay 
 this is now harder but sm and i got this 
 we 'll get some other stores to cover 2 shifts a week so we both have one day off a week 
 i get a really awesome applicant for keyholder # 2 's open position and show her where on the website to apply since our website makes zero sense for the application and want to get her in our store 
 when i bring up the page i see the sm position listed 
 now about a month ago our old sm was fired in the most <unk> shitty way so i immediately call my sm to let her know in case something shady is going on 
 i text her a picture of the listing like she asks and go on my half 
 she calls to let me know she is leaving they 've known for a few weeks but did n't want to tell me until they found a replacement so i would n't freak out '' 
 seeing as the job is still listed and she starts her new job this week i am doing exactly that 
 all doubles in a row with no relief for the <unk> future 
 not one manager in another store willing to help us out 
 no coverage for <unk> monday through friday 
 stress level <unk> so my dm and rm get told i found out what 's going on and both come out the following morning for damage control 
 this was yesterday 
 neither understood why i was stressed or upset with them 
 they offered the <unk> of walking around the mall at 10 am on a tuesday to staff my fucking store 
 right 
 i 've been looking for other work here and there as i do n't really click with this company and want something i like better 
 the <unk> and i discussed me quitting without something lined up because they were forcing me to work 2 doubles this weekend because sm is taking a fucking vacation this weekend with all this shit going on 
 so i figure fuck it 
 i 'm done 
 i 'm gon na work out my shift and hand in my keys 
 then sm shows up for her shift 
 she does n't understand why i 'm stressed tells me it 'll all be easy then asks me to follow her to her new store 
 because any sane and logical person is gon na follow the person screwing them to a new place to get screwed 
 sure 
 <unk> 
 she asks if i want to go on break and i just snap 
 i punch out go in the back write i quit '' 
 on a piece of paper and place my store keys on it 
 i grab my bag let her do a bag check say see you later '' and walk straight to my car and drive home 
 i was happily in my pajamas <unk> my cats and drinking some <unk> before the phone calls started 
 i almost wish i had answered them but none of these things were my problem any longer so i did n't want to listen to the squawking cries of these idiot women telling me i have to come back and help out '' 
 it has never felt so good to quit a job before 
 so awhile back my friend use to be a manager at our local movie theater military personnel either with id or in uniform would get a discount off their ticket price 
 i came up to get my tickets and shoot the shit with her before the movie started when this tall guy comes wearing an army uniform and beret 
 at first glance nothing seemed out of the ordinary until i looked a little closer : as former us army i know a lot of unit patches ... <unk> when when it 's someone from my same special forces unit 
 well this guy had a red beret on worn in place of a regular cover for airborne/support <unk> in sf groups but he was wearing a special forces tab no <unk> tab and upside down unit patches on left and right sides uhhh what 
 obviously set off all the red flags so i decided to have a little fun : me : hey man what sf group are you attached to 
 him : excuse me what are you talking about 
 me : what special forces group are you with 
 him : oh 
 i 'm with 10th sf group out in colorado 
 been out there for a few years now 
 there actually is a 10th group in co i know this for fact because i was attached to them right out of <unk> me : man i have n't been back to colorado in years who is the new colonel over there now 
 him : oh shit i ca n't remember his name for the life of me 
 me : you ca n't remember the only full bird '' colonel in your unit why do you even have that get up on 
 him : hey you better show me goddamn respect 
 do you know how hard it is to do what i do 
 me : and what is it that you do exactly 
 put on fake army <unk> and go to places to get discounts of other people 's blood sweat and tears and the ignorance of the business that you 're <unk> 
 him : literally yelling at me now in the lobby starting to draw a crowd what would you even know about it you play some call of duty and watch some movies and think you know everything about the army all of a sudden 
 me : okay i do n't know what you hoped to accomplish by yelling at me like a psycho but for someone with fake credentials i guess i can see why you are being so damn defensive i guess 
 him : there you go again calling me fake wtf is wrong with you 
 random stranger : umm sir 
 you unit patches are on upside down walks away he is now completely red in the face and he turns to my friend the manager and has the balls to say : him : i just came up here to get my movie tickets because the guy out there would n't give me my military discount 
 manager : that 's no problem just let me see your military id and i can print them out for you here 
 him : i 'm here in uniform why would i need to show you my army id as well 
 manager : probably because you have all but come out and say that you are playing dress up to try and save a few bucks 
 he does the walk of shame out the lobby very satisfying 
 hope you all enjoyed the read 
 tl : dr - guy puts on army uniform with upside down unit patches gets called out and gets no discounted movie tickets 
 edit- home now and put spaces in to make it easier to read sorry for the <unk> fun tale from the on campus grocery <unk> pizza place 
 <unk> : me and college bro cb cb comes up with a few groceries 
 & gt me : anything else for you today 
 & gt cb : do you have any more magnums 
 *it should be noted that condoms are kept behind the counter along with most <unk> meds and small items that were prone to being <unk> i automatically turn around and grab the magnum condoms off their hook and scan them & gt me : can i get you anything else 
 cb started turning bright red 
 & gt cb : i um kinda meant the ice cream <unk> there was a solid few minutes of awkwardness & gt me : we are out <unk> anything else tonight 
 & gt cb : no 
 i bagged up his groceries as quickly as possible as we both avoided making any kind of eye contact 
 first post on tfr 
 during my summer between high school and college i worked at a campground just outside of a major city 
 at our campground we would give each customer a map of our lots with a comment section on the side that they could fill out if they wished 
 we had a sign inside our check in <unk> encouraging customers to fill out said section 
 above it was posted pictures of our four employees with their names beside them 
 one afternoon a lady comes into our store holding what looks to be our map 
 we 'll call her comment lady cl 
 she notices the sign about the comment card pulls out a pen and begins writing 
 after a minute she comes up to me 
 & gt cl : yes i was filling out your comment card but i do n't remember the name of the employee who i talked to 
 & gt me : we have pictures of our employees here above the sign and their names are to the right of the photo 
 & gt cl : that ca n't be right i did n't talk to any of these people 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry ma'am but these are the only four employees who work here 
 & gt cl : but i did n't talk to any of them 
 none of these people look like the person i talked to 
 & gt me : do you remember what day of the week you talked to this employee 
 i could look up on the schedule who was working that day 
 & gt cl : i do n't remember 
 this week sometime 
 i think it was a guy with black hair 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but all of our employees are female 
 & gt cl : you 're f -- -- useless 
 she storms off to the other side of the store aka four steps away its a small store and stares angrily at her map for a while 
 she leaves only to come back a few minutes later 
 & gt cl : where 's your main firepit 
 i do n't see it do you take it away during the day 
 & gt me : main firepit 
 ma'am this campground is <unk> 
 we do n't allow any fire at all on our grounds 
 & gt cl : do n't lie to me 
 i roasted <unk> at it last night 
 i know you have one 
 & gt me : no ma'am we do n't 
 & gt cl : youre useless 
 this campground is f -- -- - useless and you 're f -- -- - lying to me 
 as she continues to rant a switch clicks in my brain 
 my family had stayed at a campground on the other side of the city a few years ago and i remembered them having a large firepit in front of their main store 
 but that campground was on the other side of the city a 45 minute drive away 
 there was no way this lady could have thought we were that campground ... right 
 & gt me : ma'am i think i might be able to help you ... but first can i see your campground map please 
 & gt cl : what 
 fine 
 she tosses the map to me 
 first thing i see on the top of the map is the logo for other campground 
 a campground with a totally different name than ours owned by a totally different company located literally on the other side of the city 
 & gt me : ma'am i 'm sorry to say this but you 're at the wrong campground 
 & gt cl : what 
 that 's impossible 
 & gt me : sorry ma'am but we 're our campground name 
 this map is for other campground which does have a fire <unk> 
 they probably also have male employees which would explain why you did n't see the employee you spoke to on our list 
 & gt cl : what the f -- - 
 then where the f -- - am i supposed to go 
 & gt me : i can print you off a map with driving instructions if you like or give you their address if you have a <unk> 
 & gt cl : give me a f -- -- map 
 i print one off from google maps and had it to her 
 & gt cl : what the f -- - 
 this is 45 f -- -- minutes away 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry ma'am i do n't know what to say 
 & gt cl : f -- - you and your stupid f -- -- s -- -- campground 
 you 're going to pay for this 
 cl storms out of our store but not before shoving over a rack of chips causing some of them to burst open on the ground and slamming the door so hard it <unk> the glass in the window and causes the security camera above it to <unk> 
 as i walk over to inspect the damage i notice she had dropped the other <unk> map ... which had her <unk> comment card ... on which she had written full name and phone number 
 i look at the card at the window and at the security camera and whisper & gt me : and you 're going to pay for all this b -- -h. **tl dr : ** know your right from your left 
 **edit <unk> 1pm : ** holy f -- - 
 i did n't expect this to blow up so much 
 thank you guys for over 1300 upvotes and for all your amusing comments and stories 
 you guys are da real <unk> i just posted a couple days ago on here but this happened yesterday and i felt like it needed to be shared 
 customer : c me : me coworker-cw a customer comes up to my register : c- hi this item has no tag on it '' 
 me- no problem let me get a tag for you '' 
 i call for a tag for the item over the intercom cw shows up at my register 
 cw- here 's a $ <unk> tag '' 
 c- i 'll do $ 3.00 '' cw- this is n't a <unk> we do n't bargain here '' my coworker walks away 
 the customer did n't buy the item 
 later that day i applauded her for best <unk> ever.i worked at a grocery store at a full service meat counter - this means if you wanted any type of meat steaks chicken fish etc - not deli meats you had to get it from me behind a counter 
 -- - the kid started working in the meat department two years after i did 
 he was a terrible employee right off the bat slacking off and messing around with the other part timers his age on his first day 
 sometimes when it was a slow evening we in the meat department would take food that would be going bad the next day and cook it using the hot plates on our plastic wrapping stations 
 the kid found out about this and started spending most of each shift cooking food that had just been made creating feasts for himself each day he worked 
 he stole from the meat cooler before he would leave his shift 
 he would pull what he called heists '' where he would <unk> as many cuts of meat as possible into a paper bag place it just outside the loading bay door before he left and then just drive to the back of the building to pick up his prize 
 he had <unk> with the other <unk> kids with his <unk> beef 
 store manager <unk> the kid with a passion but wanted to find a valid reason to fire him so there was no way he could come back 
 this happened his second week on the job 
 he was still learning the ropes on how to do things when the woman came in 
 we knew who she was - she was the mother of a kid in produce who frequented the shop all the time 
 she held a personal <unk> against the kid 's family though i 'm not sure why 
 she ordered 20 teriyaki <unk> beef sticks which the kid obliged to 
 however instead of placing them in a <unk> container he wrapped them up in the deli paper we wrapped plain <unk> meats in 
 needless to say she was n't happy when the teriyaki sauce leaked through to her car floor 
 so store manager finally got to bring the kid into the front office and fire him like he always wanted 
 the kid went home before he could start working his next shift 
 -- - a month later the meat department was paged with a phone call 
 upon answering it was the kid asking for his job back 
 i handed the phone off to meat manager who told the kid that in order to get his job back he would need to get approval from store manager something that was highly unlikely 
 so the kid did the only thing he could think of : he called the store every day 
 not asking for his job back but asking for hours in the meat department '' 
 he called every day for about two and a half weeks and always called when he knew store manager was out 
 when store manager finally got all of his messages he got confused and <unk> the kid as a college student coming back from a semester looking for hours 
 so he called the kid back and left a voicemail saying he would tell meat manager to put him on the schedule 
 -- - as soon as the kid walked back in the store all of his old habits came with him 
 the slacking off the heists the feasts all came back full force 
 the feasts ended quickly however when he was caught by the deli manager who promptly informed meat manager 
 i was told to cut the wires inside every hot plate to stop them from working ever again so nobody could make any food 
 the slacking off stayed the same but the heists got worse 
 he did n't just take items from the meat department anymore - he began taking everything that was n't <unk> down in the store 
 this shed light to some of his worse habits too - he began taking medicines from the shelves 
 this however would prove to be his <unk> 
 the medicine aisle was one of three areas in the entire store with an <unk> working camera 
 store manager wanted to catch the kid in the act before he could fire him again but knew the kid only stole things after he left 
 so store manager snuck into his office one day and closed the door for an extended shift ... watching the cameras closely he waited for a sign of the kid to come down any aisle there was a camera in 
 sure enough within 15 minutes of store manager 's usual punch out he saw the kid slowly walking up and down the medicine aisle 
 he was acting so nonchalantly nobody would have taken him for doing anything suspicious 
 then with one swift <unk> he swiped two boxes of nyquil off the shelves and into the pocket of his meat jacket 
 -- - half an hour later the kid returned to the meat department from his rounds of <unk> with his friends in the bakery 
 he placed his meds on the chicken cutting table and started <unk> on some candy he had taken earlier 
 as he turned around to go out to the case he found himself staring at store manager 
 & gt store manager : '' you pay for that nyquil '' 
 & gt the kid : '' i was going to pay for it when i left work today i have a cold and uh ... '' & gt store manager : '' you 're stealing it 
 i saw you on the cameras '' 
 & gt the kid : '' oh ... really 
 shit ... '' & gt store manager : '' get the f # $ k out of my store 
 if i ever see you again on these grounds i 'll have you escorted out of here by police '' 
 the kid then went home and told me the whole story 
 why was i at his house 
 the kid is my younger <unk> this was from earlier in the summer in a beach town in new <unk> 
 a big part of my job was selling beach chairs 
 this larger woman wearing a bikini and happens to look exactly like a 50 year old <unk> walks into our store with a young man by her side 
 this guy was maybe 25 years old and i 'm 90 % sure they were a couple ... or very very <unk> family members 
 this lady walks up to one of the middle of the line chairs and yells oh hell no '' 
 i ask if she needs any help and she proceeds to yell at me because the chairs are too expensive 
 i explain to her the differences in each chair and why one costs more than the other 
 i tell her that my family has actually owned one from this company for 10 years truth and she proceeds to call me a liar 
 she then says get me that chair i want to try it '' 
 i grab the chair we were talking about and place it on the ground 
 she then snaps her fingers 3 times right in front of my face and yells that she wanted to try this other chair 
 after 15 minutes of trying chairs more snapping and being called “kid” numerous times i finally convince her to buy the most expensive chair we have 
 she tries it out and completely wipes out when trying to get up ... karma 
 she gets to the front counter and grabs a candy bar and quickly eats it 
 her credit card is denied and she tries to leave but the lady behind the counter made her come back in and pay for the candy bar 
 karma is a <unk> so was this ladyso i started working at a huge pharmacy chain this summer us as a part time job teacher the rest of the year and each day i keep a tally 
 this tally is split into three sections the first is for people who ask me where i 'm from i 'm english the second is for people who like to play the guessing game hey are you from <unk> except england '' or make some <unk> joke hey am i in england all of a sudden haha '' and the third ... well the third has a sad face 
 so this conversation happened the other day : me : welcome to x do you have your store card 
 them : you 're not from around here are you 
 me : no ma'am i 'm from england them : i never really agreed with other people coming to the us if they were n't born here are you here on a visa 
 yes i <unk> 4000 miles to work in x because we do n't have anything like that in third world england 
 me : no actually i live around the corner i 've been here for about 6 years 
 them : i hope you did this legally do you have your greencard on you 
 me fed up at this point : actually you caught me i just never bothered going home when my visa ran out and i 'm laying low working at this store 
 them : really 
 that 's disgraceful 
 you should be ashamed of yourself 
 me : *sigh* ma'am i am legally allowed to <unk> in the united states and i am married to a us citizen your total is blah them : ah so you married her for the greencard the me : ... have a nice day 
 seriously just seriously what 
 i get asked a question like this not always so <unk> personal/aggressive about every day or so 
 where do i live am i married do i hate england is n't the us so much better are n't i glad that i do n't live there any more 
 i swear they do n't do this to my colleague who is also from another country but is <unk> or the other who is mexican but for some reason the englishman is fair game it seems 
 oh or they want me to give them a history lesson or talk to them about the <unk> war in the 30 seconds i 'm supposed to be checking them out 
 i do n't have a very high tolerance for customer bs as tbh i do n't really need this job else i would n't have responded as i did 
 more stories of the englishman to come 
 we were having a nice busy evening and were a bit spread thin with only two of us working 
 in walks the world 's <unk> criminal 
 okay she was pretty slick she managed to get several items before slipping out the door with a <unk> '' before we even really noticed 
 the apron was a good idea on her part as it concealed the items very well 
 she had <unk> the cameras pretty well too 
 she missed the reflection that was n't hidden from the camera but who would n't 
 the fact that it was an apron from her work was a less good idea since there are only two of those places in our smallish town 
 she is awaiting a court date 
 edit : missed a word 
 i used to work at a gas station that was family owned and operated 
 i was there for a year and the entire time the dress code was very <unk> 
 i wore jeans with holes and rips in them short shorts whatever 
 to top it off it was in an extremely nice area near a lake and the 1 % <unk> to this place because it was the only convenience store nearest the lake for beer/soda/candy 
 one day i came to work in jeans that were about 5 years old 
 they were so worn out that they used to be tight jeans but were baggy as hell and had rips on both knees 
 <unk> minimum wage the regulars there were quirky '' 
 one came in just like he does every day and grabs a 40 oz of <unk> 
 as he gets to the counter i stop stocking <unk> and meet him at the register 
 hi how are you <unk> -- '' you are so stupid for buying those jeans like that '' 
 i 'm sorry ... 
 what '' 
 you have got to be kidding me 
 you are so dumb 
 *so* stupid '' 
 i did n't buy my jeans like this ... i 've had them for years and worn them a lot ... '' no you did n't 
 you bought those jeans like that '' 
 at this point i 'm getting angry 
 this rich bastard is insulting my intelligence because he 's never seen what well worn clothes look like in his life 
 no 
 i did n't 
 who the hell would buy jeans this <unk> up 
 the zipper is literally held together by a <unk> '' 
 he shakes his head 
 designer jeans these days are so stupid 
 i ca n't believe you bought those like that '' 
 i was more confused than angry even still and a line had formed so i gave him his change and ignored him as i served the next customer 
 he continued to <unk> next to the <unk> for about 5 minutes telling the <unk> of people how stupid i was for buying baggy <unk> jeans with holes at the knees and pockets 
 most did n't care and ignored him but after one of my favorite regulars shrugged and told him looks like normal wear and tear to me '' 
 he stomped out to his car and left 
 that was years ago and i 'm still confused 
 a few years ago i worked at a local novelty shop as a sales person 
 we sold various pop culture related novelty items from tv shows movies anime 
 etc 
 the crowd that this store drew was very broad and attracted some very *interesting* characters 
 this story is about one of those characters we will call him pac and boy was this guy a character 
 it was a slow day at the store and i was tidying up the displays when in walks pac 
 **me** : welcome to store let me know if you need anything 
 pac completely ignores me and goes straight to our anime section 
 i shrug it off and walk back to the register that was located in the center of the store and organize some of the stock behind the counter i could hear pac scoffing at all the <unk> anime we carried 
 about 5 minutes later pac approached the register 
 most of the dialogue from pac is word-for-word it just always stuck with me how ridiculous it all sounded 
 **pac** : i require service 
 **me** : hey how can i help you 
 **pac** : i was wondering if you had anything of obscure anime 
 **me** : uhh no we do n't 
 **pac** : oh okay 
 how about other obscure anime 
 **me** : no we do n't carry that either 
 a smug grin came onto pac 's face and i knew exactly where this was going we had people like this come in all the time 
 they did n't want to buy anything they just wanted to flex their pop culture tastes over a store that sold pop culture items 
 **pac** : <unk> that 's pretty sad 
 you should get more stuff of previously mentioned animes they would sell like crazy 
 **me** : i would have to talk to my bosses about ordering that kind of stuff but i will let them know 
 **pac** : good i am the president of the local anime club i know what i am talking about 
 i have a lot of pull in the anime world and people will come here if i say it 's good 
 **me** : <unk> okay i will let them know 
 trying not to laugh at this point **pac** : i am looking to buy something though please tell me you have slightly less obscure anime 
 **me** : yes actually we do 
 his smug grin changed very quickly to almost a startled look 
 i showed him the merchandise we had for that particular anime 
 **me** : let me know if any of this interests you 
 **pac** : <unk> <unk> no it does n't 
 goodbye 
 pac then promptly left the store and i never saw him again 
 unfortunately i think we never got his anime club recommendation 
 tl dr customer tried to flex his advanced anime knowledge on me and tell us what stock to buy 
 showed him something he asked for that we actually had and he left the <unk> are having a bbq outside for july 4. a simple tent and grill to give our customers free food for the holiday 
 the event was to go from <unk> here is the encounter i just had this morning : <unk> crazy lady 
 me= me obviously cl : my husband told me you guys had free hot dogs today but i do n't see any 
 me : yes ma'am 
 but we are not ready yet im waiting for the manager to bring the stuff to me he is buying them now 
 it 's <unk> he should be here soon 
 cl : this is ridiculous 
 i am gon na call corporate and let them know about this 
 me : ... cl : so what can you do for me 
 me : uh nothing since i do n't have any free food available 
 at this point the manager pulls up with the hot dogs and sandwiches that were for the associates in the break room and leaves them at my table to park 
 the lady than demanded i give her a sandwich or she would call corporate still 
 cl : you need to give me one of those sandwiches or i am calling corporate 
 this is ridiculous 
 me : sorry ma'am 
 you are free to call corporate and let them know you are unhappy with our complimentary free service 
 but you cant have these sandwiches they are n't for you 
 at this point she started playing the race card on me at which point i told her to just leave 
 happy fourth <unk> dr at the bottom 
 hi guys and gals 
 sorry it took awhile to post another story 
 it rained our new roof leaked and now there 's water all in our walls and <unk> and floors 
 it 's a whole to do but all of my business stuff is safe and dry and nothing was ruined so that 's all that <unk> 
 anyway to recap i own a small pet business where i hand make items and have re-sell items that i sell at events and vendor shows 
 after years in retail i can tell you that these events bring out a different kind of crazy than good old regular brick and mortar store customers 
 for the first two years i was in business i <unk> heavily on dog and cat treat sales for my business and did n't carry anything else when i first started out 
 i 'm licensed by the department of agriculture to sell them and all of my treats have been lab tested 
 as such i am required to put all <unk> information on my labels such as the ingredients that they 're all natural to refrigerate them the fat and <unk> content etc 
 the labels then have to be approved by the department of agriculture 
 since my pet treats are all natural and therefore could only be taken to one show where i would either sell out and people would be angry that i did n't have more or i would n't hardly sell any and be stuck with tons of them and they too much for my dogs to eat i 've primarily stopped taking them to events and rely on things like my bandanas and such that ca n't go bad 
 this information is important later in the story 
 a few <unk> ago i was attending a dog cancer walk event 
 at the time i had nothing but treats 
 everything was going well i was selling out fast and everyone was so sweet 
 about halfway through the show a woman came up to me and started a somewhat lengthy conversation with me about her dog 
 her dog had just had surgery and would n't be able to eat anything but her restricted diet for two weeks but she wanted some treats for her for when she felt better 
 she wanted my suggestion on which treats would be easiest on her stomach when she was just coming off of a restricted diet 
 i told her all about the different varieties i carried and which ones had what benefit for dogs 
 then i explained to her that all the treats had to be refrigerated once you got them home i brought them in cooler bags 
 and would be good for six weeks in the refrigerator however i would be more than happy just to make fresh treats for the dog in two weeks and deliver them to her 
 in fact i tried to insist upon it 
 i do n't know what it was but something about this lady 's <unk> just told me that there was going to be some kind of issue if i did n't 
 alas i was unable to convince her 
 she decided on the pumpkin treats since they are easy on a dog 's stomach and promote <unk> and decided just to keep them in the refrigerator for the two weeks her dog was unable to eat them which was fine 
 they would keep 
 i stressed the part about refrigerating them to her 
 i showed her on the label where it said to refrigerate them 
 my business partner also told her the same thing as well as offered that we could make them fresh in two weeks and deliver them 
 she also had that same weird feeling about this lady 
 fast forward two and a half weeks 
 i get an email from any angry lady stating that she was at that specific event and telling me that she had just opened up her treats that morning and they were all <unk> 
 i emailed her back right away asking her a few questions and low and behold it 's the same lady which i should have figured out because of how long it took her to open the treats 
 after a few emails back and forth she admitted that she had kept them in her car for two weeks in the 80+ degree weather - we were having an unusually hot spring - and that there was nothing on the label telling her to refrigerate them nor had she been told to 
 i was mentally smacking her through the internet 
 i was a little upset at this woman 
 accidents happen and i 'm understanding of that so had she just told me she forgot them in her car i would not have been angry 
 but to blame us 
 no 
 however her language in the email told me a lot 
 she kept referring to myself and my business partner as those girls who were at your booth '' 
 i realized quite quickly that she did n't know myself and my business partner were the ones running the booth and that we were a small business 
 she thought that we were just two employees that the business owner had sent out into the wild to help and that she could throw this on them and i would believe it even though i had handed her the business card with my name on it and told her i was the owner 
 this time though i did n't correct her 
 it was my first year in business and because i did n't want to get a bad name i told her that i could n't refund her because she had left the treats in the car but i could replace them and i would also deliver them to her 
 she lived a half an hour away but i felt that i had to do what i had to do to make the customer happy 
 honestly it would have been cheaper and easier to refund her as i would n't have money into making a batch of treats for one jar and i could just mail the check out but i felt something was fishy and i wanted to investigate it further so i took this route 
 i told her i needed the molded treats back in their original packaging for the exchange 
 she asked me why and i explained to her that like any other retail store we need the bad items to exchange it for a new one 
 this is a policy i stand by today 
 she balked at this and suddenly i had a feeling that something was fishy especially considering she was very careful in her email to specify that she had just opened the treats that morning and the email came through before 10 am 
 one would <unk> that she either still had the treats or if she had thrown them away they were on top of the garbage and easy to fish out 
 let me just make a side note and let you guys know they were in a mason jar so it was n't like garbage could have destroyed the packaging 
 i even told her i would just take the mason jar back if she had thrown the treats out - because those things are n't cheap - and she balked at that too 
 regardless she and i make a date for me to bring the treats to her and she asks me again if i 'm sure i need the old treats back 
 i tell her yes 
 the date comes and i specially make the treats fresh for her that morning 
 i would like to note that i did n't have any other shows for a month and a half past the date we were supposed to meet so any treats that did n't fit in the jar went to my dogs 
 i was n't going to be selling them anywhere 
 <unk> into early summer is a horrible time for events and shows in this area so unless they 're dog related i do n't do them and nothing dog related was coming up 
 also with the pumpkin treats there 's no way to really evenly split the can of pumpkin and keep the rest of it so it 's still good for the next time i want to make treats so i basically have to make the whole can all at one time to guarantee them fresh 
 this makes a ton of treats 
 well the day of right as i 'm getting ready to walk out the door she cancels with the excuse that she is n't feeling well and has to go to the doctor 
 that 's cool 
 it happens 
 however the next day she has available for me to take her the treats is almost two weeks away 
 i do n't like to sell treats to customers that more than two days old that way i can guarantee that they stay good in the refrigerator for six weeks 
 this whole batch of pumpkin treats go to my dogs i make fresh treats for her the morning of the next time we are to meet and she cancels again right as i was leaving 
 the third time i was supposed to meet with her she emails me that morning and tells me she ca n't meet with me because she has to catch a flight as she 's going on vacation 
 this was the point that i had just had it with her 
 she clearly knew ahead of time that she was going on vacation that day and had to catch a flight and she had been the one to pick the days 
 i told her that she was still welcome to the treats but she had to come get them because i would not make another day to meet her after she canceled three times in a row less than an hour before i was to be there 
 i was very polite but i had to put my foot down somewhere 
 not only that but my dogs could n't eat all the treats i had made for her in those three times and although i took them to the animal shelter down the road and they got good use out of them it was just a lot of <unk> work and money i had to put out 
 she asked for a refund and i again told her that i could not do that since she had been the one to leave the treats in the car when we had told her they needed refrigerated and it was on the label as well 
 she tried to tell me those girls '' must not have put the proper labels on and no one told her about refrigerating them all over again 
 that 's when i very politely and professionally decided to tell her that it was actually myself and my business partner that were at the booth and it 's just the two of us running the business 
 in fact i remembered her well because she had told me her dog had just had surgery and had to eat a special diet for two weeks so she was keeping the treats for when the dog felt better and we had offered to make her the treats fresh in two weeks and deliver them to her but she refused 
 i also <unk> to her that i had made the labels and put them on myself 
 they were labels that were approved by the department of agriculture and ones that i was legally obligated to put on and that also legally had to include the fact that they had to be refrigerated 
 i never heard from her again after that 
 i personally believe she was trying to pull a fast one one me 
 every time we set up another date she would ask me if i really needed the old treats back 
 i repeatedly told her i would just take the jar if she had thrown them out and she still tried to talk me out of it 
 the fact that she kept asking me about needing them back and she kept <unk> on me at the last minute only to try for another refund just struck me funny 
 i was bringing them to her 
 she did n't have to go out of her way for any part of this and i was doing it all on her schedule and her chosen days 
 also she spent at least an hour <unk> me back and forth on the last day we talked so she clearly was n't too eager to catch that flight she so desperately had to cancel on me to catch 
 this lady is one of the reasons that i now only sell <unk> items 
 tl dr - lady buys pet treats from me at an event 
 we tell her they need refrigerated plus my department of agriculture <unk> requires me to have instructions to refrigerate them on the label 
 she contacts me two and a half weeks later tells me she left her treats in the car in 80+ degree heat and they molded 
 she says the girls at the booth never told her they needed refrigerated not realizing myself and my business partner were the ones at the booth and that the label did n't say anything about refrigerating them 
 wants a refund 
 i offer her new treats 
 we set up a date for me to take them to her three times 
 she cancels on me every single time as i 'm walking out the door 
 i finally tell her that my treats require the labels to say that they need to be refrigerated i labeled them myself and the girls at the booth that she spoke with were myself and my business partner 
 she never bothers me again 
 edit : a lot of you are asking some great questions 
 the department of agriculture heavily regulates how i can and can not sell my treats how i can and can not store them what <unk> as all natural '' and what does n't etc 
 but basically i have to sell them a certain way to comply with the department of agriculture regulations 
 they check everything 
 my store offers knife sharpening 
 it 's normally 5 dollars a blade but sometimes we have promotions where the first blade is free 
 also machine sharpening costs the same as stone sharpening which is insane and kind of a stupid thing since using a stone takes not only longer to do but is a skill not many of us at my store have 
 it 's not easy to learn compared to the machine and since most people 's knives cost several hundred dollars it 's sort of a huge risk on our part to do it even though they sign a liability waiver saying that if the knife gets damaged it 's not our fault because you know how customers are if something went wrong it would be our fault even though there 's a legal document stating otherwise 
 guy comes in wants knife <unk> i tell him price 
 & gt guy : last time it was free i thought it was always free '' 
 & gt me : because it 's a service that requires additional service and time we do charge a fee for it 
 however we do run <unk> from time to time where first blade is free and the rest are still normal priced '' 
 & gt guy : are you sure that seems odd you 're already paid hourly why is n't it free '' 
 note that the guy was n't being rude he was just genuinely curious 
 we talk about how it 's a service being offered just like gift wrapping or having your car washed 
 we 're a store we mostly sell stuff but do have these other things too 
 the guy is still incredibly polite and i 'm having a really good talk about differences in sharpening methods and what 's exactly happening to the knife during sharpening and the different stones and <unk> something most customers do n't want to hear about because they do n't care they just want a good sharp knife and they want it now 
 even though he was trying to get a service that in all honestly we do n't charge enough for with the amount of time and training it took to master he 's a pretty fantastic dude with not getting frustrated even though he did drive a decent distance to be there 
 i later pulled his purchase history up cause i was curious and he does spend a lot of money with us too 
 those last two points being things customers try and tell me all the time when they 're whining about how they deserve '' a discount 
 after a while of talking about the above mentioned things the following amazing thing happened 
 & gt guy : well i feel bad taking up your time he was n't it was slow and i was enjoying the conversation with someone who was actually interested in what i had to say but i just do n't want to pay for this 
 would it be alright and not against any promotional rules if i just waited til the next promo and bring the knife in then '' 
 why ca n't all customers be this reasonable 
 like hey there 's a thing i want 
 you offer a discount on it 
 it happens multiple times a year and i do n't need it right now 
 it sucks the discount is n't right now but i 'll wait til it is 
 but first let me also make sure that 's okay 
 it is 
 just for his attitude i offered to do it for him then and there explaining it would take about half hour to an hour for set up and the process maybe longer depending on business 
 since it was slow i could have easily done it 
 but he was gon na wait til it was actually the promo because he did n't realize how long it would <unk> wasted too much time talking about other stuff and did n't have the time that day and did n't want to drop his knife off and come back <unk> tell his friends to come with us 
 and he told my boss how great i was 
 so pretty much he 's the best ever and i ca n't wait for him to come back 
 tl dr : customer had fully <unk> brain 
 am shocked 
 i work in a hardware store and for a while now my store manager has been stealing 
 his fiance is a gold <unk> - she drives a fancy bmw <unk> with personalized plates - his <unk> plates 
 she always has the latest brand name crap and he is borrowing cars from people because his regular car broke down and they ca n't afford to fix it 
 just for the record - this chain pains really well so he 's on well over <unk> a year plus the fiance works full time too 
 but whatever 
 for a while he 'd start at say 10am but fix it up in the computer to say he started at 8. in a fortnight he 'd have accumulated an extra 15 hours that he did n't work 
 he got warned for it 
 others in the company who did the same thing were sacked but this guy is <unk> apparently 
 so in the last week i 've noticed how often he does refunds on random crap for himself 
 a can of paint here a broken fitting there ... decided to tell another manager about it ... but everything is well used out of warranty past the return period does n't have receipts ... i 'm getting him fired basically 
 they 've just spent a million dollars on a house 
 they 're losing that 
 because of me 
 strange feeling that one 
 ps - just a <unk> 
 just because i lack 'manager on my name badge does n't mean i know any less 
 i probably know <unk> gas station offers a <unk> air pump so people can inflate their tires however it 's out of order right now 
 people tend to not hang up the hose then drive over it when they drive away 
 as a courtesy we also keep a tire gauge behind the counter that people can use 
 a customer walks in the other day and asks if he can use the tire gauge 
 i hand it to him assuming he knows our air pump is n't working 
 he <unk> the store a minute later 
 & gt **guy** : hey you know i need to put air in my tires and *your* air pump is n't working 
 i tried using it and now my tires have less air than before '' 
 i guess \ & gt <unk> font was n't large enough for our out of order '' sign 
 before i can apologize for the inconvenience he goes on 
 & gt **guy** : i know a place that has a <unk> air pump but they do n't have a gauge so i 'm going to <unk> this okay '' 
 he holds up the tire gauge i handed him 
 is he serious 
 & gt **me** : i ca n't let you do that '' 
 & gt **guy** : really 
 c'mon i 'll bring it right back '' 
 & gt **me** : sorry i ca n't just let you walk off with store property '' 
 the guy scoffs at me and whips the tire gauge back across the counter so that it falls on the floor 
 & gt **guy** : <unk> thanks a lot buddy '' 
 yeah sorry we do n't run a rental service 
 i mean we <unk> tire <unk> for less than $ <unk> ago as a young assistant manager of a video rental store we only had a handful of customers one night that were browsing around the store and these three kids maybe <unk> years old come in 
 one of them has their large pet snake around his neck 
 i genuinely did n't care and it was n't as if we have an official no animals '' policy 
 i notice some of the customers were a bit on edge when he walked by them so i decide to talk with him 
 & gt me : sir could you please take your pet outside 
 & gt kid : why 
 & gt me : we do n't allow animals in the store and that some of the customers were becoming uncomfortable 
 & gt kid : well what if i was blind and had a seeing eye dog 
 & gt me : sir we do n't get a lot of blind people coming into a video rental store 
 even his friends could be heard giggling at it 
 i felt so good even though it was only some punk kid i had <unk> : wow front page 
 thanks guys 
 due to popular demand i 'll post the angry french couple story tomorrow 
 <unk> : new story is up 
 angry french couple <unk> by eye twitch <unk> : the destroyer : in which the op is brutalized by a three-year-old i was working the saturday night drive-thru shift at a popular fast food place 
 it was maybe 10 pm 
 we were pretty busy typical saturday night crowd - soccer moms in their minivans <unk> with their loud bass music playing and <unk> from a nearby hospital on their way to the night shift 
 a <unk> pulled up to order 
 the driver a typical spoiled college kid began his order with sup '' and ended every other sentence with bro '' 
 while i was inputting his order he exchanged raunchy jokes with the guy in the passenger 's seat 
 they ordered 2 large size combo meals ... and an order of chicken nuggets 
 when the car pulled up to the window both of the bros had their shirts off 
 they looked fairly sweaty despite the fact that it was barely 80 degrees <unk> <unk> for any <unk> 
 they both had the expression that said yeah we 're the shit '' 
 i could n't tell what they were so proud of ... until i looked in the back seat 
 the back seat of the car contained the <unk> crack whore i have ever seen 
 her skin looked like something from the thing and her nails were several inches long 
 her boobs <unk> like wilted rotten <unk> 
 she was wearing platform heels ... and nothing else 
 i could n't tell for sure but i think her hair was a wig too 
 when i handed the bros their food she stuck her <unk> head into the front seat and screeched at me in a voice like a million nails on a <unk> : can i have some ketchup '' 
 i shoved a handful of ketchup packets into the bag and <unk> 
 the bros handed her the box of chicken nuggets <unk> up their shitty rap music and peeled out 
 if this story gets enough positive attention i 'll make another post about a very angry french couple.i manage the bakery in a small town grocery store 
 we require 24 hours notice on orders but if you call the morning of i can see if i have time that day to make you a cake 
 most of the time i will squeeze you in 
 it 's been this way since the store opened at least 30 years ago 
 most of our customers are local and know this because they 've been shopping here for years 
 so it 's about 10 minutes until my shift ends and my cleaning girl cg comes to the back where i 'm prepping tomorrow 's dough 
 & gt <unk> 
 there 's a customer here to make a cake order 
 she demanded to talk to you 
 anyone in the store can take down an order 
 the fact that she was demanding me should have been my first hint 
 so i go out and find unreasonable lady ul standing there with her arms crossed tapping her for impatiently 
 & gt me : what can i help you with 
 & gt ul : i need a cake made 
 & gt me : alright will <unk> be for tomorrow or next week 
 & gt ul : i need it for right now 
 & gt me : that 's not possible 
 i need at least a few hours notice for a handmade cake 
 i have some pre decorated cakes that you can get and i can just write on them they 're only <unk> though 
 & gt ul : i need it now though 
 my boy will be so upset if he <unk> get his cake 
 i do n't want a pre decorated cake i want something unique 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but i do n't have time to make you a cake right now 
 would you like to see the <unk> cakes 
 & gt ul : i guess i do n't have a choice do i 
 this store is useless 
 they could n't make me a meat and cheese platter or fruit platter either 
 well i do n't care 
 my son needs a cake for his birthday so he 's going to get one 
 & gt me : all departments require 24 hours notice for orders 
 if you look here these are the cakes i can write on for you 
 & gt ul : ugh they 're all ugly 
 but i guess this one will have to do 
 she points to a <unk> with squiggles and sprinkles 
 i quickly <unk> down the spelling of her sons name and grab some red piping jelly 
 when i bring her the finished cake she gets upset 
 & gt ul : there 's pink on here 
 & gt me : the piping jelly 
 it looks more red to me 
 & gt ul : no the squiggles 
 there 's pink squiggles 
 he 's a boy 
 pink is for girls 
 the cake has three colours of squiggles pink blue and yellow 
 because she chose the cake i did n't think anything was wrong 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry 
 those were on there when you picked the cake 
 & gt ul : take them off 
 & gt me : what 
 like take the icing off & gt ul : yes there should be no pink on this cake 
 so while you 're at it take the pink sprinkles off too 
 & gt me : that would ruin all the other decorations on the cake 
 if you want them off you 're going to have to do it yourself 
 ul walks away with her cake yelling about our useless store '' i finish up what i need to do in the back and head home 
 as i pass the cashiers i hear her yelling about how our handmade cakes are cheaper they are and the store owner refusing to give her a discount because there 's pink on the cake '' 
 i hate <unk> person who arrived at my supermarket at 3 minutes past close yes we are in fact shut - that 's why the door would n't open for you 
 no i 'm not going to let you in 
 no i do n't care that you just ran 5 minutes to get here you should have left 5 minutes earlier 
 yes i am aware it 's only 3 minutes '' past - i have to go home 
 even if i did let you in i could n't serve you because i 've counted my register and i 'm not about to count it again 
 no it does n't take like 30 seconds '' to count my register and even if it did that would be 30 seconds i could be leaving work earlier not to mention time spent waiting for you to buy your stuff 
 no the self-checkouts are not working they 're signed off 
 no my manager wo n't let you in either 
 he wants to go home too 
 no kicking the door wo n't help 
 no going to the other door and yelling wo n't help 
 no kicking the receiving bay door wo n't help 
 no i do n't care if you starve to death '' 
 even if you do die because i refused to serve you i feel it 's probably more your fault than mine 
 sincerely somebody who 's just worked 9 hours and has to be up again in <unk> guys 
 i 'm a 17 year old student and i had been working at a local independent bookstore for roughly six months just to make some disposable income and not have to rely on my parents so heavily for cash 
 from day one the <unk> was extremely rude <unk> and condescending towards me and all of the other employees 
 if anybody made a small mistake or did anything to somehow upset the owner let 's call her gertrude they would be berated reprimanded and cursed at by gertrude 
 i always considered myself to be a good <unk> always on time usually early always did what i was told and more always told her at least a week ahead if my shift had to change and really helped to get more customers in for events 
 one time she had to leave early to take her daughter to the doctor and i was left completely alone to run the store for several hours while she was gone 
 one saturday i was scheduled to work from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm 
 the store was extremely slow that day and there was another girl working as well as gertrude 
 my older sister was having surgery that morning so i was a bit anxious all day 
 my mother called me frantically at around 1 pm saying i had to come home immediately to take care of my sister who had just gotten released from the hospital and could not be left alone since my parents had to go deal with a different emergency that could n't be put off whatsoever 
 i figured it would n't be a big <unk> this was the first and only time i had ever had to leave work on such short notice 
 the store was completely dead and there was n't any other work to be done 
 i went to go inform my boss 
 & gt me : hey <unk> i 'm really sorry but i 'm going to have to leave at 2 pm to go take care of my sister she just got out of <unk> '' & gt boss : what 
 how old is she 
 she can take care of herself 
 how dare you 
 you are not leaving you are not going anywhere 
 & gt me : <unk> mother just called me frantically i really have to- '' & gt boss : you go call your mother right now and tell her that your ass is staying here 
 i do n't care 
 this is unacceptable 
 you should be ashamed '' 
 my boss scolded me for at least 10 minutes and once she was finished i ran into the back room to call my mother while nearly hysterical from all of the stress 
 she told me she would be calling the store to talk to gertrude and not to worry 
 five minutes later me and gertrude were both at the front desk where the phones and computers are located 
 the phone rings and i can see on the screen that it 's my mother 
 i ca n't hear much of the conversation but gertrude hung up on my mother angrily and then turned to me : & gt boss : there seems to be a miscommunication 
 tell your mother that you have a job '' 
 at this point i was furious with gertrude and so fed up with her constant verbal abuse 
 i did n't need this job badly enough to put up with this so i looked her dead in the eye and said : & gt me : no i do n't 
 not anymore '' 
 i punched out and i walked out the front door 
 it was the single most satisfying feeling to see my boss completely speechless for once 
 i emailed her to send my last check in the mail and i have n't returned since 
 hi tfr 
 i work in the jewelry industry and i have a lot of stories about difficult and/or overly emotional customers but this one is really the most ridiculous 
 it happened last fall when i was working as an assistant at a small jewelry and watch repair store 
 guy comes in with a <unk> watch rubber bracelet <unk> with a <unk> meant to <unk> the band to fit over a wetsuit and wants me to cut it to fit his son 
 on these types of watches you actually cut the rubber on the band to make it fit the <unk> 
 so i measure the kid and cut the watch to fit him 
 about 90 seconds after they leave the guy walks back in the door alone and starts yelling about me making it too small 
 i ask him to go get his son so i can check it again 
 i can get two fingers underneath the band 
 it fits 
 either way he demands that we get a new bracelet for it and starts going on and on about how <unk> it was and how he got it in <unk> and that 's when i know it 's going to be a nightmare 
 flash forward a few weeks and he drops off a packet of papers with a <unk> for payment of almost $ 300 for wire transfer fees calls to italy and a new band at nearly twice the cost of the exact same one we already ordered 
 my boss refuses to pay in part due to the <unk> language he was using to describe me and my work and his <unk> to understand that we can actually get watch parts that he ca n't since we were in the industry 
 it was n't a well-known watch company so we had to go through some <unk> <unk> to get the bracelet but we definitely got the exact bracelet 
 he shows up a few days later looking for his money and when my boss refuses to pay him he starts screaming and shouting and telling him he will ruin the business and that we have n't seen the last of him 
 guy shows up an hour later with his son and literally protests our store 
 like with poster board signs that say <unk> butchered my <unk> and encourages his kid to go talk to people coming into our store and tell them to go somewhere else 
 we call the cops and i was hoping he would get mouthy with the officer and get tased in front of our store 
 no such luck but our property manager banned him from the entire shopping center and he definitely got put in handcuffs for a minute and got a ticket for trespassing 
 the thing that really disturbed me the most was him dragging his kid into it 
 i hate knowing that kid will go out into the world thinking that 's how you treat people to get what you want 
 ugh yesterday was my last day working at a fast food place 
 so for the past week or so i 've been a bit less cheerful then i usually am towards customers 
 anyway before i start ill tell you one quick story 
 a really big woman comes in an orders a wrap with steak in 
 it 's busy and she claims she was handed a chicken wrap 
 she only comes and tells us and demands a new wrap <unk> she 'd ate all of the chicken one 
 anyway on to the main story 
 i get asked to cover someones night shift because he was sick a few people were off meaning a lot of work for those who came in 
 it was one of those days where everything is going wrong one of the screens for the ordering lanes we have two lanes was n't working properly 
 i was in the drive thru payment box 
 because it was a 14 year old taking the orders on a broken screen i decided it would be best to check with all the customers that their orders were correct before i took their payments 
 now most customers are reasonable people and having their order read back to them is fine 
 but then we get to douchebag customer dc dc pulls up to the window sitting in the back of what looks to be his parents expensive car he 's got a <unk> on and a pair of <unk> and a nasty look on his face me - <unk> was that a large 20 nugget meal with sweet and sour and 2 large burgers '' dc- ''where the fuck is my extra 10 pack of nuggets moron '' me - ''erm sorry about that we 're having trouble with the screens i 'll just put that through now for you with the rest of the meal '' dc - ''you 're a fucking idiot i want it free '' 
 i 've mentally killed him 8 times now 
 but i just want him out my face so tell him the total and he hands me his card me- <unk> this paypass '' in australia you can pay but <unk> your card on the screen dc- ''no 
 cheque account '' 
 me - <unk> you like a receipt '' 
 he snatches the receipt out my hand dc- ''you 're a stupid fucking whore '' 
 as they drove through it suddenly dawned on me i already have <unk> and another job lined up 
 i do n't need to take this bratty guys crap 
 so i walked through yes leaving another car at the window my bad sorry guys in the next car when i went back they were super nice as well to the next window 
 now the person doing <unk> was busy making a <unk> for the next car and must have assumed i 'd hand the food over 
 i took out his 20 pack of nuggets handed him the food he looks through the back dc - ''i ordered nuggets you idiots '' i simply pick up the nuggets open the lid and throw them through the window on to him then throw the box 
 he looks so confused 
 dc- <unk> the fuck you whore '' just then one of my favourite managers walks in she 's a filipina lady who do n't take no shit she also does n't speak fantastic english but she is a good manager dc - <unk> just threw my nuggets on me '' manager - ''no no <unk> would n't do that she 's a good girl she earn lots for charity '' dc is still screaming the queue is getting bigger and finally manager snaps manager - ''i said no she not do that 
 she is very good you are rude you go now or i 'll call the police '' and back to the box i went and it was n't mentioned anymore 
 in fact surprisingly enough the guy did n't even call to complain about it and admittedly i went and had a little cry afterwards 
 but damn it felt so good to afterwards 
 just posted a comment in reference to this so i thought i 'd post it up here 
 working at big red corporate hell auto parts store 
 i am the general manager of the store <unk> power 
 and a few years ago this event took place 
 it was a friday morning around <unk> i had just made it to the store to open 
 got into the main office i noticed a note about a very pissed off customer that came in for parts last night that got shipped to another store 
 not our fault this happens all the time usually we just give them a 20 % discount on the transaction and they go on their merry way 
 well this guy apparently threatened to do harm to multiple employees why someone did n't call me the night it happened i 'm not sure 
 they had filed a police report and taken all the info 
 i hear someone knock on the door keep in mind it is me and 1 other employee in the store right now 
 i figured it was the new guy coming in for training so i sent other guy to go get him 
 this is where all hell breaks loose 
 let me stop and say first that i was an army <unk> scout <unk> and i have been shot at hit with a <unk> and almost blown up by an <unk> 
 none of that helped with this situation 
 queue og haha funny accident running in the the office and slamming the door 
 og : he 's got a gun 
 me : what 
 who 
 og : guy from last night 
 so i immediately started calling the cops 
 as i 'm hitting the last 1 i start hearing shots ringing through the store 
 i keep <unk> and explain the situation knowing that 2 layers of drywall are n't going to stop a round from tearing me a new hole 
 i told og to stand directly behind the office door it 's a solid <unk> door before anyone gets all up in arms about using the black guy as a human <unk> 
 this entire time the guy is still firing i could tell that he had <unk> at least once 
 he was yelling something incoherent i just sat there and waited for the moment when he started shooting the office 
 i 'm not sure how long had passed for all i know it could of been minutes 
 but what happened next astonished and changed my life 
 i hear sirens finally and more people yelling then massive amounts of gunfire had to be at least 3 different pistols then i hear : cop : this is the police if there is anyone else in here announce yourselves and come out slowly 
 me and og walk out they take us into cuffs and put us in the back of the car while they clear the store as were walking out i see that the entire store is a mass of <unk> holes there 's oil all over the place in general it was destroyed 
 they ask us what happened get statements and i tell them i need to call our district leader and corporate about this 
 this is where i decided that i would never work for this hell hole again along with the other employee that was there 
 i called the <unk> office and told them what had happened filed an ass load of paperwork by this time it was roughly <unk> they then asked me : corporate overlords co : can you work around the mess 
 me : are you fucking kidding me 
 i just told you the cops shot and killed a person in my store ... co : yea can you work around it 
 me : pissed beyond <unk> at this point seriously you want me to work around the body and pool of <unk> that has massed around the dead guy in my fucking store 
 co : so i 'll take that as a no 
 i do n't think i 've ever yelled at someone so much 
 one of the cops actually had to take the phone from me and make me go smoke a <unk> 
 in the end me and og got 2 weeks paid off a trip to the police station court and one hell of a story to tell our kids 
 tl dr pissed guy shoots up my store gets shot by police corporate office asks if we can still run the store that day 
 edit : fixed formatting along with <unk> edit : sorry for the wall of text 
 i 'm a <unk> person and feel this story is best in all its glory 
 i work alone at a dry <unk> 
 this lady comes in and hands me her tickets to pick up her dry cleaning 
 she had more than the average bear 's worth of dry cleaning spread out over a few tickets 
 i add up her total twice and check to make sure it matches her receipt 
 okay your total is $ 82 '' 
 she looks at me flabbergasted for a second 
 no it 's not 
 the guy told me that it was $ 72 '' 
 i 'll double check the math '' 
 i added everything up again and said no i 'm sorry 
 this is $ 82 see '' 
 no you 're wrong 
 why would he tell me that it was $ 72 
 he must have been giving me a discount '' 
 he might have <unk> or <unk> but he wrote right here on your ticket $ 82 '' 
 well you need to get him on the phone then i need to talk to your manager '' 
 i 'm sorry that man is not the manager 
 my manager does n't actually work at the store 
 i 'm in charge for the day '' 
 well i 'm going to need his number '' 
 she was huffing and puffing at this point and i was also getting <unk> 
 my boss had given me a no nonsense policy and tells me to ask customers to leave and not come back when they get indignant 
 she also does n't want me calling her for any reason 
 she 's not a very good manager 
 i 'm sorry to be honest with you i do n't know the other employee 's number and i ca n't give you my manager 's cell phone number '' 
 well then call her 
 get her on the phone right now '' 
 i 'm sorry i ca n't call her in the middle of the day 
 she 's at work right now 
 i 'm the manager right now '' 
 this argument repeats until she gets the picture 
 i 'm not paying anymore than what that man told me 
 $ 70 is all you can have '' 
 that 's fine if you just want to pick up a few things 
 we can hold on the the rest until you can pay for them '' 
 are you fucking kidding me 
 you 're going to be stealing my clothes from me 
 i can take them if i want to '' 
 well we 've already provided you a service i 'm not going to give them back until you pay for them '' 
 <unk> using big words like this piss people off 
 in retrospect i was being condescending 
 at this point she goes over to her clothes and starts tearing them out of the bags 
 she 's throwing the bags all over the floor huffing and mumbling and tearing her clothes off the hangers 
 these look like shit 
 i 'm not paying for these '' 
 i 'm sorry i 'd be happy to redo them for you 
 it would be ready to pick up in two days '' 
 fuck 
 i need them this weekend 
 no you ca n't redo them 
 but i 'm not paying full price 
 i 'm sorry the total is still $ 82 '' 
 i was not giving in who the fuck do you think you are '' 
 she screamed 
 i then make the worst mistake of my life i chuckle 
 not to be condescending but because i am really uncomfortable 
 i mean really uncomfortable even after five years in retail i am in awe every time some yells at me like this 
 i am a <unk> and am still constantly in shock that people can be so aggressive and hateful 
 i 'm <unk> whatever 
 anyway i chuckle a nervous <unk> laugh 
 she loses it 
 this is not a fucking joke 
 i 'm not fucking playing with you right now 
 my husband is going to kill me when i get home if i spend $ 80 fucking dollars on these clothes 
 do you understand that 
 he 's already pissed off with me and he 's pissed off with you for taking so fucking long to get his clothes done 
 you do not want him to come here 
 i do not want to bother him with this shit 
 he 's already pissed off with me '' 
 which makes me more uncomfortable thinking her husband probably beats her 
 ma'am please stop cursing at me 
 there are kids in here '' 
 there were 
 i 'm not cursing at you 
 if i was cussin at you i 'd be call you a <unk> fat-ass bitch <unk> fucking heifer 
 i 'm not calling you any of those things am i '' 
 alright i 've hit my limit 
 i 'm sorry i 'm going to have to ask you to leave '' 
 you ca n't do that 
 i 'm going to call 911 '' 
 ... um okay '' 
 i was really confused 
 she took out her cell phone and called 911 
 hello i 'm at this dry <unk> and i 'm having a domestic dispute 
 we need an officer right away 
 yes thank you '' 
 i look around for a bit trying to wrap my brain around what 's happening and said <unk> 
 well i 'm going to get some work done while we wait for the police '' 
 i picked up all the trash and hangers she threw all over the floor 
 in retrospect i should have left them as evidence she was being crazy 
 i guess she might have said i threw it at her 
 the police station is right up the road so it was n't a long wait 
 oh she called in late for work while she watched me pick up her mess 
 the officer came in and he was super polite and calm 
 she recounted her story which was mostly true if a little biased 
 me not giving her a discount me not calling the manager 
 she also added that i owed her for the money she was missing by not being at work in time 
 she did say that i told her she had to leave after she called 911 because i was trying to hide the evidence 
 <unk> 
 i then said that was n't true that she called the police after i asked her to leave 
 the officer looked a little confused and asked me what happened 
 he turned back to the lady and said okay 
 what can <unk> police department do for you today '' 
 she said well officer if i 'm not happy with the service i need a discount '' 
 he turned to the lady and said you know i do n't want to discourage you from calling 911 when you need to 
 you should call if you 're in danger 
 or in the case of criminal <unk> but this is a dispute that the police department ca n't settle for you 
 why do n't you come back on another day to pick up your clothes '' 
 yes sir officer that 's a good idea '' 
 i agree he said 
 i 'm going to need you to step outside with me so that i can get your information 
 just in case you need me again '' 
 and she left 
 he took her info outside and she got in her car and presumably drove to work 
 she came back the next day and payed $ 82 for her dry cleaning 
 i felt really bad for her 
 hey guys 
 here 's my first post 
 i 'm not a great story teller 
 i work at a pizza shop near my campus 
 this area has a bunch of restaurants all within a block or two of each other but we do n't interact or anything until a couple nights ago 
 it 's a crazy slow night probably the <unk> since i started working but i 'm with a good crew so the night is n't so bad 
 as <unk> back from one of my few deliveries i see a cop leaving the store with a pizza 
 do n't really think anything of it 
 when i get inside i find a bag with about four dozen donuts from an extremely <unk> donut shop 
 awesome 
 the cop had traded us delicious donuts for a pizza 
 there 's only a few of us working so 4 boxes of donuts is a bit much 
 now one of the restaurants across the street is a popular mexican place and my coworkers and i start joking about how we should trade them done of our excess donuts for some nachos or something 
 my next delivery comes up and i decide hell why not 
 on the way back from the delivery i stop inside and ask us they want to trade 
 i 'm met first with i better ask the manager '' which leads to me h having to display the donuts like a <unk> full of money 
 next thing i know the whole staff is <unk> my nachos : <unk> i get back and we feast on a box of fresh nachos 
 <unk> a good night considering i did n't make any <unk> another story from fast food 
 when someone places an order we have to ask them for their name 
 then i look at the screen and run the orders out 
 the next order was for batman '' 
 i go to the counter 
 & gt me : order for batman '' 
 & gt customer : yeah that 's me 
 you just got one thing wrong '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry 
 what is it '' 
 & gt customer : you spelled my name wrong it 's supposed to be bruce wayne '' 
 -- -- i walked right into that one 
 wow 
 tl dr : batman orders food is actually bruce wayne 
 greetings tfr again from the wonderful world of <unk> do n't know 'bout our friendliness drive-thru* 
 today 's tale is about a <unk> act of <unk> that i not only took part in but did so gleefully 
 our drive-thru 's design is a source of contention for many people 
 here 's a crude drawing of it 
 note my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 two speaker boxes both <unk> into a single line that goes to the payment then pickup windows 
 seems simple enough like it 'd be hard for anyone to screw that up 
 right 
 if you really believe that to be the case i urge you to read more of this sub 
 such high faith in the intelligence of the common person is not healthy 
 seek help 
 the general idea is that whomever has had their order finished first goes first 
 often this is not the case as the urge to get their <unk> <unk> and <unk> sweet teas frequently causes people to <unk> any <unk> of traffic safety and view <unk> assault as a perfectly <unk> means to <unk> off a whole four seconds between them ordering their meal and receiving their food 
 conversely this also creates people who feel that <unk> should have gone first despite them taking an additional thirty seconds to order their slop and <unk> within them an indignant fury that just needs to be released 
 this is about the latter 
 our players in this story are a lady named bengie why bengie 
 because she works at a <unk> 's clinic and has a dog that looks kinda like <unk> 
 me of course 
 and a really angry <unk> we 'll call angrybieber why angrybieber 
 because he was angry and had a stupid justin bieber haircut ... probably the source of his anger now that i think about it 
 it was a rather typical day for business 
 we had a line of cars in the drive-thru things are kinda moving a little more slowly than normal i 'm taking orders in the outside lane and also taking money 
 the usual 
 i open my window to receive payment for an order when a couple cars back i hear some frantic car horn honking 
 slightly annoyed but thinking nothing of it i continue my duties 
 bengie gets to my window 
 & gt me- <unk> $ 4.93 please 
 & gt bengie- hey bud how are ya 
 & gt me- about normal 
 here 
 standing 
 probably should be working 
 & gt car behind us- <unk> 
 ** *angry <unk> shouting* 
 & gt bengie- i 'd also like to pay for the guy behind me 
 <unk> about a $ 3 order so nothing big he 's been shouting at me because he thinks i cut him off back there 
 & gt me- ... are you absolutely certain you want to do this 
 & gt bengie as she flashes a slight <unk> smirk- yes 
 also tell him i said life 's too short to be so angry '' 
 with these transactions completed she heads up to the pickup window 
 angrybieber approaches 
 & gt me- <unk> & gt angrybieber interrupting me and quite living up to his name and stupid stupid <unk> did you see that 
 that **angry <unk> pulled out in front of me 
 let me take a moment here 
 that angry <unk> '' as he so eloquently put it is one of the nicest damn people i have ever met and is one of the sweetest regular customers i have 
 i 'm not <unk> she 's so sweet that she once performed a blood sister ritual and killed her partner through diabetic ketoacidosis^ this may or may not be true 
 also there 's a monitor that displays camera footage of our speaker boxes in my booth 
 i pay attention to it 
 i took angrybieber 's order 
 it was <unk> that bengie was supposed to go before angrybieber and it was angrybieber who was trying to cut in line 
 back to the story 
 & gt me as calmly as i <unk> that <unk> nice <unk> just paid for your meal 
 & gt <unk> in <unk> <unk> ... wha 
 & gt me nodding- <unk> 
 & gt <unk> you 're joking 
 & gt me- nope 
 she asked me to tell you life 's too short to be so angry '' 
 the look on angrybieber 's face was priceless 
 it was such a beautiful combination of confusion shock and shame 
 pure 
 <unk> 
 shame 
 i can not find the words the describe how wonderful it was 
 they should have sent a poet 
 angrybieber tried to <unk> out a response but was too embarrassed to do so 
 i handed him a receipt told him to have a nice day and he slowly <unk> away from my window with his head hung low 
 tl dr- sweetest person ever makes angry jerk feel shame for being an angry jerk with a simple act of kindness 
 edit- woah 
 thank you so much for the gold anonymous benefactor some guys like to do this to female cashiers and although it is a small gesture it is incredibly demeaning and always pisses me off 
 when he goes to pay with cash it is always a guy that does this in my experience he holds the money out then pulls it away as the cashier reaches for it 
 then he looks her straight in the eye as if expecting her to giggle <unk> or to <unk> for his money 
 i refuse to reach for anyone 's money after they do this and make them set it on the counter 
 i 'm ringing you up not giving you a lap <unk> so i 'm not gon na put on a show for your <unk> story i just told a friend and figured i 'd commit to the ages here 
 after i left the store i have spoken at length about i was working for a chain of craft supply stores 
 i was hired on as a manager but they did n't actually have a store to put me in 
 so i was serving as acting store manager in multiple locations 
 basically if you were the store manager and went on <unk> in the hospital or if a manager had been fired or quit and they were moving in the new store manager they would just have me fill in at the store until things settled 
 i did this for eight months travelling over eight states living out of hotel rooms which was n't actually what i signed on for but that 's another story so i am in new york covering a store and in walks a guy with a return 
 all returns in this company were handled by a manager and we had final discretion 
 in this case the guy was obviously pulling some scam 
 the product was used and had old packaging but he had a new receipt 
 plus he had an out of state license 
 he claimed that he was on vacation but who takes along a receipt to make a return from two months ago while on vacation 
 he huffed and puffed when i told him no and threatened to go to another location 
 that night i got a call from my dm 
 a manager had been fired and they were relocating me now 
 i drove overnight to <unk> edit realizing that not everyone knows distance here 
 i drove for 9 hours that night non stop save for bathroom breaks 
 it 's really far away 
 i met my dm at the store to get the keys and story and stuck around a little while before crashing at the hotel 
 halfway through the day i get paged that a customer has a return 
 i come up and its the same guy 
 i let him talk about his return show me his receipt then i smile and say just like i told you in new york you ca n't do this return '' 
 he stared at me for a moment 
 i 'm a redhead so he slowly recognized me eyes going wide and he backed away 
 he glanced over at the doorway i had come from confused 
 then he just left leaving his receipt behind 
 the other store was n't his local '' store where the receipt was from either although closer to home so he had just apparently tried to pull the same scam elsewhere only to meet <unk> 
 <unk> 
 christmas 
 bring on the crazies 
 a woman approximately 70 yrs old bought a few groceries with a <unk> of eggs 
 she gives me a coupon 
 it 's $ 0.70 off when you buy a certain brand of butter and eggs together 
 but i bought the butter last time 
 i bought both of them so now i need the discount '' 
 not how that works ... i tell her gently it has to be on the same transaction 
 she gets so mad she starts shaking and <unk> her words 
 she insists that i 'm full of crap basically 
 another assistant manager was listening and comes over to help me bag 
 she decides to scan the coupon to show the lady 
 ca n't be read 
 i. do n't 
 care '' 
 the crazy lady fumes 
 i bought eggs and butter '' 
 i ask for a receipt to make a point 
 she has none of course 
 you know what '' the other assistant says 
 i believe you '' 
 with a turn of a key and a wink of an eye this lady has a discount 
 she walks away satisfied 
 later my coworker approaches me and says you know she just <unk> she got that discount 
 she actually paid full price 
 turns out that coupon did n't even come from our store because we do n't have that brand of butter '' 
 i laughed the hardest i had laughed all day.so i was working at a popular video game store a couple years back when fifa 10 was just being released 
 it was a high volume store so we got plenty of copies 
 this also meant we had a huge amount of preorders 
 people would often <unk> the game specifically to get the included collector 's items and we had one customer we 'll call him fred that called up the day before and <unk> the collector 's edition for his son 's 10th birthday 
 it was one of the last ones we had in stock so he was lucky to <unk> it in time 
 fast forward to release day and it was crazy busy 
 for the first time since i 'd worked there we actually sold every one of our preorders on release day as well as all of our regular stock 
 except for one - fred 's copy 
 so the day <unk> along <unk> and as it drew to a close we only had one copy left which was reserved for fred 
 i was constantly turning people down for sales of the game or signing them up for a copy when a new shipment arrived 
 i then left the register to do some inventory for 10 minutes before returning 
 in just 10 minutes my genius colleague managed to sell fred 's copy of fifa 10. i did n't know this had happened so about 20 minutes after i 'd returned to the register fred and his wife walks in and asks to pick up his son 's copy of the game 
 i do a search for the game and our stock says a big fat zero 
 this includes reserved stock 
 me : i 'm sorry sir we just sold the last copy 
 there must have been a mixup and your reserved copy was sold to another customer '' 
 fred : what 
 but i reserved it 
 it 's for my son 's <unk> birthday tonight '' 
 me : i apologize it 's entirely our fault 
 we do n't have any copies to sell you today but i can put you on a waiting list for the next shipment that comes to the store if you 'd like '' 
 it 's at this point i notice fred 's wife is crying 
 i notice that fred is visibly trying to control his anger but his face is going red and i can see that the situation is not getting any better 
 fred : my son 's birthday is tonight and i promised him we 'd play the new fifa tonight 
 what am i going to do 
 this is unfair '' 
 i feel very sorry for these people and i realize that this is a very unfair situation for them so i <unk> 
 me : i 'm really sorry sir 
 let me do a quick search for other stores in the area that have stock and here 's a $ 25 off voucher for the game 
 i hope that makes up for our mistake '' 
 as i was talking i found a store about 10 minutes away that had stock of the game 
 as i handed the voucher to fred his entire composure changed completely 
 he was dumbfounded and a massive smiled exploded onto his face 
 fred : oh ... wow thank you so much 
 i 'll go there right now and pick the game up 
 thank you 
 i 'll definitely come back to this store from now on '' 
 and his wife thanked me profusely as well 
 i felt great 
 i 'd made a family 's day kept a customer happy and probably saved the store a lot of bad <unk> 
 those are the moments that make retail worthwhile 
 as i was closing up that night the store manager came up and started talking to me 
 store manager : fat_head i saw what you did with those customers today 
 you do realise that 's a serious breach of store policy 
 that 's $ 25 off the other store 's margin 
 those vouchers are supposed to be for the & lt other game & gt promotion only 
 i 'm going to speak to the area manager about this and i never want to see you do that again without my permission '' 
 i was speechless 
 i could not believe a manager could be so <unk> that he 'd prefer to absolutely piss a customer off because of my colleague 's mistake over giving them a voucher and making them happy as anything 
 i was furious that night because even though it was apparently against store policy i did n't deserve to be told off 
 next day i come in for my shift and the area manager is talking to the store manager 
 i get pulled into the back room 
 area manager : fat_head store manager has filled me in on what you did yesterday with the $ 25 coupon 
 unfortunately that is a serious breach of store policy and we 're going to have to <unk> your employment 
 please give me your store key and leave immediately '' 
 i was actually not really that surprised 
 i was only a casual and so they could fire me on a <unk> and the area manager was equally as penny-pinching as the store manager 
 me : you know what do n't bother firing me i do n't want to work here if you 're going to treat me like this 
 i tried my best to keep the customer happy but hey do n't let me stop you from pissing off the people who pay your wage 
 did store manager tell you it was & lt employee & gt 's fault their reserved game was sold to someone else 
 i guess that 's perfect grounds for firing the employee that fixed the situation 
 now there 's some good management '' 
 then i dropped my store key on the ground and walked out without another word 
 maybe that was a bit too rude but i just could n't believe that they 'd value $ 25 over customer service 
 just another example of managers power tripping and penny-pinching without caring for the people they are there to service 
 oh well i 'm glad they fired me 
 it was a terrible place to work 
 tl dr i rant for ages about getting fired for fixing our store 's mistake.i work at a green bank 
 some of our locations that have <unk> offer public bathrooms due to the construction of the bank where they need to move the plumbing from the back of the bank to the front in order to make room for the drive-thru teller station 
 however the location i work at is by pedestrian access only so no drive-thru 
 it 's a regular day at work and it 's getting pretty busy 
 we 're on one of the main streets of the area and we have many businesses and regular customers that go in and out of the bank 
 one of our tellers we 'll call her mary is finishing up a transaction with her customer <unk> abl and as i 'm greeting by the teller line i hear their conversation : & gt abl : where are your bathrooms 
 & gt mary : i 'm sorry 
 unfortunately at this location we do not have public restrooms 
 there is a food court right next door where you can use their facilities for free 
 now abl starts shrieking out of nowhere demanding a manager and complaining about the rude service mary has just given her 
 hearing all this commotion my manager comes over to quickly deal with this lady 
 all the other patrons are <unk> and watching this mess unfold 
 & gt manager : miss what seems to be the problem 
 & gt abl : where do you use the bathroom 
 & gt manager : i 'm sorry ma'am 
 the restroom the employees use are located in the back by the <unk> and we are unable to <unk> you access 
 my teller did offer the closest restrooms which are right next <unk> & gt abl : this is ridiculous 
 i know you have bathrooms 
 i need to use it 
 i am the customer 
 my business pays for your salary 
 & gt manager : i am truly <unk> & gt abl : stop yelling at me 
 what is your name 
 give me your business card 
 i am going to report you to upper management about this 
 and then she leaves the bank quickly muttering about our horrible service and how we are america 's most <unk> bank 
 a couple of days later we get an e-mail from our corporate headquarters saying that we did not handle the situation correctly 
 they said that we should have guided the customer by hand to the nearest bathroom in the area and made sure they were able to use the facilities next door and then return to work ... <unk> though we are constantly understaffed and not anyone 's baby <unk> 
 the kicker -- the lady wrote a review about us online saying that we were unprofessional and the manager yelled at her ... hello again 
 today this story is from my days at a big box pet store 
 i was the dog trainer food specialist and reptile specialist for my location 
 so my days off were few and <unk> 
 on this day i needed to get supplies for my <unk> as it was cage cleaning day and i had forgotten when i worked the day before 
 so i decided to bring my snake satinka with me 
 satinka is a 5 foot ball python 
 not big at all for a python but big enough to get reactions 
 i know a lot of people do n't like snakes so i do n't ever shove her into anyone 's face 
 a lot of the time when she is n't moving around people do n't notice her 
 this is not one of those days 
 i walked into the store with her around my neck grabbed a hand basket and headed towards the back of the store where the reptile supplies were 
 about halfway back a woman did a double take as i walked past 
 we will call her dog lady 
 then there was scream and the crash of her hand basket full of dog supplies hitting the ground 
 i turned back to her pretty sure i was the source of the scream 
 i ca n't even get a word out before she starts yelling at me 
 dog lady : what is that thing doing in here 
 get out 
 those are n't pets 
 sdrakkan : i 'm sorry you feel that way ma'am but she is my pe- dog lady : i do n't care what you think 
 get out of the store 
 you are n't allowed to have that in here 
 sdrakkan : ... you do know this store sells reptiles right 
 dog lady : i do n't go in the back of the store because i know they are back there in cages 
 that is not in a cage and i want it out now 
 sdrakkan : ma'am i 'm allowed to be here with her just like you bring your dog 
 it 's a pet <unk> dog lady : i 'm tired of your excuses 
 i want a manager 
 i want you out 
 i sighed and turned to go to the office to get coolboss my manager 
 coolboss is not a snake fan but she <unk> them regardless 
 lucky for me she comes around the corner just then to find out what the yelling was about 
 coolboss : sdrakkan what is going on 
 sdrakkan : this lady wants satinka and i to leave 
 coolboss : ma'am what seems to be the problem 
 dog lady : this girl seems to think that creature is allowed in here 
 coolboss : that girl is my reptile specialist in here on her day off with her pet snake 
 any pet is allowed in- dog lady : what 
 you allow them in here 
 that is n't right 
 coolboss : yes we sell them and have absolutely no problem with anyone bringing their pet into the store 
 dog lady starts sputtering looking between coolboss and i. by now there is a crowd watching all this happen and she starts trying to get them to agree with her 
 there is n't a one 
 one even mentioned that they had brought a <unk> from me and they were eager to meet satinka 
 turning back to us she kicks her basket still on the ground 
 dog lady : if this is how to you treat a loyal customer then i will never be shopping here again 
 that thing is not a pet and you are going to hell for touching it 
 now i probably should n't have but i could n't help myself 
 i lifted <unk> front half and <unk> her on the top of the head 
 then so be it '' 
 dog lady : i 'll be calling corporate on you 
 you will both be fired 
 coolboss : ok ma'am you go ahead and do that 
 have a nice day 
 she stomped out of the store still yelling 
 coolboss rolled her eyes and asked if i needed any crickets 
 tl dr whipped my python out and made a woman scream 
 edit : gold 
 i 'll make sure to give satinka an extra large rat for her contribution to this story 
 & lt 3 edit 2 : another one 
 now i have to remember more stories ... stay tuned 
 : <unk> for a different kind of story 
 about 2 months ago it was decided that we gas station clerks would wear t-shirts every other day instead of the standard uniform 
 it 's part of a promotion we 're doing 
 the shirts bear the name of our mascot and say hello my name is mascot '' 
 also we do n't wear our name tags with the t-shirts 
 this has proven to be confusing for our customers 
 you guys know how it goes sometimes a customer will refer to you by name after they read your name tag 
 well i have customers who now think my name is mascot 
 & gt '' thanks mascot '' 
 & gt '' have a good day mascot '' 
 no big deal 
 i do n't blame my customers for not realizing it 's a promo t-shirt 
 and if they do some of them say it as a joke 
 except lately it 's gotten worse 
 customers are now calling me mascot on days when i 'm wearing my normal uniform complete with my proper name tag 
 some ask & gt '' is your name really mascot '' 
 with each passing day i answer that question with less and less certainty 
 these everyday <unk> are wearing on me 
 & gt '' hey the screen says <unk> but your shirt says mascot '' 
 it 's getting bad 
 now i 'll hear the name mascot outside of my job and i 'll instinctively turn my head in response 
 that 's how strong the conditioning is 
 it 's only a matter of time before i adopt mascot as my new <unk> 's my first reddit post so i apologize for doing stuff wrong 
 i used to work at a cafe 
 one day and a customer put in an order for her friend 
 she got a hot chocolate with espresso 
 okay one mocha coming up 
 i made the drink gave it to the girl and moved on 
 about fifteen minutes later the phone rang 
 & gt **me : ** thank you for calling the cafe how can i help you 
 & gt **customer : ** my friend just ordered me a hot chocolate with espresso and it tastes like it has coffee 
 & gt **me : ** yes ma'am 
 & gt **customer : ** i 'm allergic to coffee 
 i did n't want coffee in it 
 & gt **me : ** ma'am espresso is coffee 
 & gt **customer : ** but i did n't want coffee in it 
 & gt **me : ** but you wanted espresso 
 & gt **customer : ** yes 
 & gt **me : ** ma'am you ca n't have espresso and not have coffee 
 & gt **customer : ** what do you mean 
 & gt **me : ** espresso is coffee 
 by ordering a hot chocolate with espresso you ordered a coffee drink 
 & gt **customer : ** but i 'm allergic to coffee 
 can i have a refund 
 & gt **me : ** yes ma'am i 'd be happy to give you a refund 
 & gt **customer : ** i 'll be over in a minute 
 time passes 
 & gt **customer : ** hi i called you earlier about my hot chocolate with espresso 
 & gt **me : ** yes ma'am 
 & gt **customer : ** now explain to me again why this has coffee in it 
 & gt **me : ** * screaming internally about how espresso is coffee 
 * you ordered it with espresso in it correct 
 & gt **customer : ** yes 
 & gt **me : ** espresso is coffee 
 & gt **customer : ** but i did n't want coffee 
 & gt **me : ** then you did n't want it with espresso 
 & gt **customer : ** yes i did 
 & gt **me : ** ma'am you ordered a mocha : hot milk chocolate and espresso 
 espresso is coffee 
 & gt **customer : ** but i 'm allergic to coffee 
 & gt **me : ** then you do n't want espresso 
 & gt **customer : ** how is espresso different than coffee 
 & gt **me : ** * whips out espresso beans and coffee beans 
 sets them before the customer 
 * this one is espresso 
 * shows espresso beans 
 * this one is coffee 
 * shows coffee beans 
 * there really is n't much of a difference except espresso is <unk> 
 & gt **customer : ** what makes them different 
 & gt **me : ** the beans are roasted differently but they come from the same place 
 espresso is a form of coffee 
 & gt **customer : ** well i 've had a hot chocolate with espresso before 
 the girl put something from over there in it * points to the area where we have our espresso <unk> and our flavor sauces * 
 & gt **me : ** which one ma'am 
 the espresso grinder 
 & gt **customer : ** * walks to where we kept our flavors and points 
 * this one 
 & gt **me : ** ma'am that 's chocolate sauce 
 & gt **customer : ** okay 
 well can i have a cappuccino 
 & gt **me : ** no 
 * pause * a cappuccino is hot milk milk <unk> and espresso 
 & gt **customer : ** oh 
 well i really wanted a cappuccino 
 & gt **me : ** i really would n't recommend it if you 're allergic to coffee 
 & gt **customer : ** fine i 'll just take a hot chocolate 
 tl dr : customer wanted coffee without the coffee 
 i was at my local gas station and took my place as third in line 
 the <unk> woman wearing <unk> leggings and a <unk> top who was first in line was cashing in her <unk> lottery tickets and she had quite a few 
 the second lady in line <unk> <unk> asian woman waited patiently as did i but the first woman had completed her transactions and proceeded to block the cashier 's window while she sorted her change and bills into the various pockets of her purse 
 the cashier looked at the asian woman who pushed a bill under the window and gave a pump number 
 <unk> '' jumped like she had been <unk> and started yelling and waving her arms like she was fighting off a cloud of flying <unk> 
 you 're supposed to wait your turn 
 i was n't finished 
 you 're in america 
 that 's how we do it in america '' 
 she stomped out still waving her arms about and the three of us looked at each other and burst out laughing 
 the cashier said god help america ... '' this is from my days as a manager at a large consumer electronics store in the mid 90 's ... 't was the night before thanksgiving and all through the store every associate was <unk> we were stocking some more 
 piles upon piles of consumer electronics because we all knew that black friday would soon be upon us 
 <unk> boombox : just $ 29 '' the ad screamed in big print limited to 100 but they would n't get the hint one hundred boomboxes stacked on the endcap with care with full knowledge that soon none would be there 
 5am chimed the clock the stores doors did roll up 
 the shoppers charged in to pick cheap crap up 
 in just 20 minutes the pile it was gone 
 but still customers came looking for one 
 so a sign was made all boomboxes are gone - please do n't ask for a raincheck we ca n't give you one '' 
 the associates then did move along with their tasks 
 that is until the entitled customer asks ... where is this boombox i need to buy 8 '' 
 they 're all gone '' replied i 
 you 're just a little too late '' 
 but i came all this way i demand you get more '' i have none to give you they 're all headed out the door '' 
 at this point i gestured to a store filled carts many with boomboxes sitting athwart 
 the customer did <unk> as he walked away i 'd ruined his christmas i 'm sure he would say 
 on with my duties i had merch to get out but soon was paged to another area where a <unk> had broken out 
 it seemed that our customer had hatched an idea and begun stalking other shoppers with the thought of then stealing 
 when at last confronted after 2 successful thefts he was then punched in the face with a very hard left 
 voices were raised many blows were then thrown 
 the police soon showed up and then all were all gone 
 edit : wow gold 
 thank you anonymous benefactor 
 okay so this story started out in comments on another post 
 as i was typing it out it occurred to me that i should probably just go ahead and make this it 's own post so everyone can enjoy 
 cheers 
 i was working at my small town grocery store at the time as a lowly cashier 
 we had these chores we had to do before the end of each shift 
 my particular chores were facing the medicine aisle absolute worst <unk> to have fuck those tiny boxes facing the bread cleaning the bathroom 
 you get the gist 
 **the incident in question : ** i 'm facing this damn medicine aisle so many boxes and of course as i 'm straightening the tylenol some other random boxes fall off the shelf and onto the floor if you 've never had to face the medicine aisle i suggest you go to your nearest grocery store and try it out just for shits and giggles : d then tell me about it 
 i turn around to pick up the fallen boxes and there was a little boy i think he was 7 based on size and communication skills 
 he was picking up the boxes for me 
 he said here miss you dropped these '' and i smiled and thanked him 
 as he 's handing me the boxes this fucking lady comes <unk> down the aisle and screaming at me 
 she will be referred to as bscl for bat-shit crazy lady 
 **bscl-** what the hell do you think you 're doing '' 
 **me-** ... <unk> 'm sorry '' 
 **bscl-** you heard me 
 why are you trying to kill my son '' 
 i look at the kid 
 he looks at me 
 we both look at his mom look at the boxes and look at each other again 
 **me-** i ... i 'm not 
 i dropped these boxes and he was being really sweet and picking them up for me '' 
 **bscl-** no you 're trying to kill my kid 
 i will sue your fucking ass '' 
 **me-** <unk> fucking confused* ma'am how exactly am i killing your kid 
 **bscl-** *screaming at the top of her lungs* you know exactly what you 're doing 
 get the fuck away from my son '' 
 i look at the kid again and he 's just as baffled as i am 
 he looks at me and i heard him mumble i 'm really sorry '' to me and i felt just so so bad for this kid 
 **bscl-** you probably try to kill kids all the time do n't you 
 well i 've got you now you bitch '' 
 **me-** i ... .you know what 
 yeah you got me 
 i kill kids for fun 
 at my workplace too 
 would you like me to get a manager '' 
 **bscl-** you bet your ass i want to talk to a manager 
 and after that confession i 'm calling the fucking police after i 'm done with your manager 
 you will go to jail for the rest of your life '' 
 **me-** <unk> a shit eating grin on my face at this point* oh you bet i will ma'am '' 
 at this point my manager comes around the corner turns out he was in the next aisle over practically waiting for his cue '' because he was doubled over with laughter at the sheer ridiculousness 
 just because i figured it would piss her off even more i saluted my manager and did a nazi walk all the way back to my register small store so she could see me the entire way 
 i could hear the entire interaction as well as the rest of the store 
 **bscl-** your employee is trying to kill my kid 
 she 's a goddamn nazi killer 
 there 's something wrong with her 
 i 'm calling the police and i 'm suing her and this company if she 's not fired 
 <unk> well i ca n't confirm whether or not if <unk> is a nazi i 'm sure not going to fire her 
 you can go ahead and call the police 
 i will be waiting for you and them at guest services '' 
 he promptly walks away 
 so bat-shit crazy lady calls the police screaming at the dispatcher that i was trying to kill her kid at the store and management was refusing to help her 
 police got there in record time i think 
 my manager ended up going outside to talk with the police and this woman so i did n't hear the conversation but hey guess who came to visit me 
 her kid 
 he shuffled to my register and this is what happened with us 
 he 'll be referred to as <unk> for sweet kid 
 **sk-** i 'm really sorry about my mom 
 i do n't want you to go to jail 
 it 's all my fault '' 
 poor thing actually started crying 
 **me-** do n't worry buddy i 'm not going to jail 
 if you want though you can pick out any candy you want and i 'll pay for it myself '' 
 at that point his eyes lit up and he grabbed a kit-kat 
 **sk-** this is my favorite '' 
 **me-** awesome 
 it 's my favorite too '' 
 so i rang up his kit-kat and paid for it 
 he opened it and gave me a piece 
 **sk-** here i want you to have some because you 're really nice 
 and it 's your favorite too 
 can we be best friends '' 
 guys my heart is made of ice and oh my he absolutely melted my heart 
 after this exchange everyone comes back in and the police take my statement 
 they kept making <unk> comments directed towards that lady and her being well insane 
 they asked me what the medicine in question had been 
 **me-** children 's vitamins 
 they 're still on the floor over there if you want to go look '' 
 at that point they glanced at each other and went back outside with the kid 
 i do n't know what actually happened after that but yeah i kill sweet children my new best friend at that 
 for fun and with vitamins made specifically for them because i 'm a nazi 
 hope y'all enjoyed 
 happy monday 
 : d edit : fuck 
 i had an extra word 
 all better 
 : di 'm at work getting things cleaned up around my sporting goods counter and put away because i was getting ready to head home soon 
 an older married couple walks up to the counter in my department and the man asked if i remembered him 
 he looked vaguely familiar but when you work with several dozen customers a day it 's hard to recall a specific one sometimes 
 & gt i came in a few months ago and bought some 12 gauge <unk> shells y'all had for cheap 
 do ya have any more 
 they were in a green box '' 
 i thought for a minute and did remember the shells if not him 
 * '' oh yeah those 
 i 'm afraid we sold out not long after you got yours and we have n't gotten anymore in since 
 * & gt damn 
 well what else do you have 
 i 'm going duck hunting '' 
 i tell him to wait a moment and walk down the aisle to get some in my opinion decent <unk> 
 i return with the box and after giving it a once over he buys it 
 after i hand him his bag he reaches into his wife 's purse and pulls out one of these he then starts loading it at the counter 
 now i had n't heard a <unk> out of his wife until now 
 as soon as he started loading the belt she started fussing at him 
 & gt you ca n't do that 
 they 'll think you 're going to shoot the place up 
 the police 'll come lock you up '' 
 after putting in two or three shells he gives her a long look and says & gt would you just <unk> 
 i ai n't breaking no laws 
 he knows points at me i ai n't gon na do nothing 
 i ai n't even got no gun with me 
 am i breaking any laws '' 
 * '' not to my knowledge no 
 * he then resumes loading the belt and while looking her in the eye starts doing it slower 
 this apparently was not the response she was looking for 
 she snatched the bag the shells and the belt from the counter grabbed him by the arm pulled him in close and spoke in a voice that made me glad i was n't <unk> as she started pulling him to the front 
 & gt '' now listen here you know i have dinner in the oven at home and if it burns up you are coming back to this store with those shells in your ass '' 
 i could n't even wait until i got to the back before i was laughing.today at <unk> thrift store i was working as main cashier 
 a woman probably mid to late 30s we 'll call her jan came to my register with a cart full of board games and activities 
 & gt jan : i 'm so sorry 
 my cart is so full '' 
 & gt me : hey no problem '' 
 & gt jan : i took a new position as a social studies teacher for 5th and 6th graders near local mall and i needed <unk> activities '' 
 now my store does n't have a teacher discount or anything 
 however history is my favorite subject and my 5th grade teacher and 6th grade social studies teacher both had <unk> effects on my life including inspiring me to sit for the <unk> us history <unk> last year 
 & gt me : that 's awesome 
 and you 're teaching a great subject '' 
 & gt jan : very true 
 and it 's a critical age for these kids '' 
 & gt me : yeah this is when kids start to love or hate history so you have a lot of work to do '' 
 & gt jan : i 've got some great projects in mind '' 
 we discuss projects for a little while and this woman reminds me so strongly of my 6th grade social studies teacher and i tell her this 
 & gt me : i think your students are absolutely lucky 
 i think they 'd have a hard time not being engaged '' 
 & gt jan : oh thank you so much 
 that really means a lot 
 i 've been a sub for 8 years and this is the first full time position i 've gotten '' 
 unfortunately i finished ringing her up at this time 
 & gt me : while making eye contact it looks like my finger ... <unk> over the 20 % off button ... '' confirm the discount & gt jan : speechless thank you so much oh my god '' 
 i can see the tears in her eyes 
 i swipe her card and send her on her way and this interaction carries me through the rest of the shift i volunteered to take to cover for my best friend 
 work at petrol station open 24h 
 we have a customer who comes in complaining about not getting his disability money in time because the payment office are so mean '' to him 
 he gets more money in disability than i earn 
 he mentions this every 
 single 
 time 
 because of this he often asks if he can fill his tank with petrol now and pay tomorrow 
 we always say no but he keeps asking 
 this guy is weird and quite fat and likes to just drive around at night saying that he is so bored 
 some times he gives us a bottle here you get money back when you return empty plastic bottles for <unk> and asks to take a piece of candy 
 he will also ask me if i smoke wanting me to give him cigarettes for free 
 the other night he was talking to me again complaining about not having any money 
 then he asks me do n't you have any food that is being thrown away that i can have '' 
 i tell him no i 'm not allowed to do that for obvious reasons and he just loudly exclaims yeah well i guess it is better to let people starve then '' 
 so i just look him up and down and say oh i 'm sure you 're not in immediate danger of that happening '' 
 which quite effectively shut him up and made him leave 
 i hate that creepy bastard 
 he wears a tank top on the outside of his t-shirt 
 who does that so the store i work at closes at 9. starting around <unk> we go up to customers that are shopping and offer them assistance after telling them we close in 10 minutes 
 and starting at 9 we do overhead announcements that we 're closed 
 anyway it gets to be 9:15 and this woman and her daughter are still walking around 
 i go up to them and politely as possible tell them we 're closed 
 the mom turns to me and starts talking in spanish about how she does n't understand me 
 now i had just heard her talking in english to her daughter who was conveniently pretending not to listen 
 i then put on my trusty retail smile and said estamos <unk> '' 
 the look on her and her daughter 's face was amazing : she grumbled on her way to the register and grumbled on the way out 
 what did she think was gon na happen 
 that we 'd let her stay past closing just because she does n't know english 
 seriously 
 also this store is in texas 
 it would take me all of two seconds to find an employee that can speak spanish 
 also did i actually say we 're closed '' correctly 
 google says i 'm right but it 's not the best at <unk> 
 i wan na know if my high-school level spanish is as good as i now think it is 
 i was cashiering at a grocery store a few years back when i got to experience this exchange 
 i had an elderly black gentleman at my register and the cashier behind me had a woman with her toddler in the cart 
 the toddler had a very light sunburn barely <unk> but the woman was <unk> about how her poor child '' had to deal with such a terrible sunburn '' and how it was such a burden for her 
 when she finally paused the gentleman at my register said loudly yeah i 've been trying to get rid of my sunburn my whole life '' 
 the woman and other cashier froze but i thought it was so funny i dropped whatever i was scanning trying to hold in laughter 
 it did n't help when he pointed at me and said yeah she got it '' 
 he left with a huge grin and a tip of his baseball hat and us cashiers had a few moments of chuckling before the next customer came up.i was telling a friend about my time working in normal retail when i remembered this happening at the time i was working at a second hand electronics shop and a day prior a colleague had sold a digital camera to a woman i noticed her come in to the shop with the camera in hand and because my colleague was out at the time i decided to offer my assistance 
 she wanted to know how to use the functions of the camera but it did n't come with an instruction book however the website offered <unk> versions of it 
 & gt me : oh see if you just go here and click here you can download the instructions as a pdf file '' 
 & gt lady : i beg your pardon '' 
 & gt me : oh a pdf is- '' & gt lady : you 're telling me to download a <unk> '' 
 & gt me : no a pdf file portable document for- '' but before i could finish she stormed off leaving me and the staff at the counter at the time laughing <unk> <unk> up the years in customer service i have perfected my <unk> *butter would n't melt in my mouth* customer service persona 
 retail smile 
 check 
 feigned empathy and concern towards rude customers 
 check 
 however i was not prepared for this encounter ... now i am naturally a morning person 
 thus my boss usually sticks me on super early opening shifts 
 i always warmly greet everyone regardless of the time of day 
 i clearly was not prepared for the <unk> g 
 <unk> walks in at 7 am 
 * & gt me : good morning ma'am 
 *retail smile* how are -- & gt g : people like you should be shot 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry 
 * yes i am canadian and the word sorry is very near and dear to my heart 
 * & gt g : i am not a morning person and i do n't want anyone talking to me before 12 pm 
 so do n't speak to me 
 & gt me : uh okay ... <unk> and off she went 
 of course i apologized profusely to the retail gods 
 what had i done to receive such <unk> at 7 in the morning 
 some customers never fail to <unk> me 
 hehe ... <unk> woman on black friday 
 i was the backup cashier for a big name bookstore on black friday 
 i opened the store at 8 am expecting the worst because of the groups of people at either end of the store 
 however it stayed relatively quiet for this most <unk> day of the year 
 i was walking around in the toys and games section which was bogo 50 % off and <unk> this young but petite woman trying to <unk> around a ton of <unk> on the shelf accessories books clothes dolls which are not part of the sale 
 like a good retail slave i notify her of the sale and then i ask her if i can hold those items for her at the register 
 she thanks me politely for the assistance gets excited about the deals and gets back to shopping 
 i pass her again about 10 minutes later and she 's got another <unk> which i also take back to the register 
 i do this about four more times no exaggeration she had a ton of toys 
 when she was finally ready to check out she comes to my till 
 i eye the pile of <unk> nervously and ask her if its ok to ring these items up in separate transactions 
 she had gotten two of everything : two play tents to of the learning touch globes two <unk> two <unk> to <unk> ... oh wait that 's <unk> 
 well you get the gist 
 she had a ton 
 the smart computer '' would only get her bogo on the cheapest items some $ 5 packs of math dice instead of buy one $ 140 globe get the next $ 140 globe % 50 off 
 she agrees to do separate transactions to get her the best deal 
 since i 'm going to be with her for a while chat her up 
 when she tells me that she 's not buying these gifts for her or her children but for the children of some underprivileged kids from a nearby shelter 
 i was incredibly touched 
 she was so patient and sweet through the whole thing 
 not in a rush like so many other black friday deal vultures 
 she even got the store membership that we offer to get her even more of a discount 
 yay for reaching my <unk> on the first transaction 
 in the end she spend about $ <unk> 
 none of it on herself 
 since she has to make several trips out to her car i help her load it up 
 and she gives me a $ 20 tip 
 insane 
 it made my day 
 people like her are the reason i come to work 
 good patient people 
 firstly i would like to send out my <unk> thanks to everyone who responded with advice and indignation on my behalf over this incident 
 seriously you guys are all awesome 
 for anyone who has n't read about what shall henceforth be known as the incident '' in my memory banks you can read it here 
 today or i suppose yesterday as it is well past midnight now i got a call back into the office to speak with our dm on the phone 
 what had apparently happened and was <unk> by my gm was that the complaint was forwarded to him and he just forwarded it to our store 
 he had never actually read what the complaint was outside of customer was humiliated and insulted '' so he wanted immediate action taken 
 still really shitty response but it is what it is 
 he apologized to me profusely for several minutes before telling me that the write-up was to be <unk> and that no disciplinary action would be on my employment file for this 
 i have to say i am still feeling all warm and fuzzy several hours after listening to him eat <unk> over this 
 he is normally such a jerk 
 it was lovely 
 i did make a point to tell the dm that my managers should n't be <unk> for following his direction 
 this was me <unk> covering of my own ass 
 i need this job and i wo n't have them thinking i was trying to get them in trouble despite the fact that if it had n't been handled the way it was i would have done my best to crucify them 
 i will fully recognize and acknowledge that it was an act to <unk> my managers 
 my asm and gm have both apologized to me as well 
 hr must have jumped right on this because i really was n't expecting to hear anything about it for a few weeks yet 
 i did tell them that i understood their need to write me up after a direct e-mail from the dm but that i was hurt that i was <unk> for going my job 
 asm told me that she understood how i felt and that she would feel the same way though the gm did n't seem to have much to say about it at all outside of being sorry that all this happened 
 i still think they should have told me it was a shit complaint when they talked to me the first time but it has happened so i 'm letting it go 
 i will give my own apology to those who so very much wanted me to fight this harder than i did and for leaving it at this 
 i got the outcome i really wanted 
 an <unk> of <unk> and an apology 
 i have a two year old who is growing faster than i can keep clothes on her and i need to be able to support her 
 as much as i hate my company i need this job and i really ca n't afford to piss off the people who make my schedule 
 they have back tracked so quickly and i am feeling some serious righteous vindication 
 this had actually turned out so much better than i thought it would 
 thank you again to all of <unk> worked in the electronics department of a major retailer which meant i often had to deal with purchases that could only be rung up at the electronics register 
 no way we 'd let someone walk around with expensive merchandise before paying for it 
 sometimes however people would come to electronics to check out because they did n't want to wait in the normal line 
 usually this pissed me off because if a help needed in the game console aisle '' alert goes off i 'm busy ringing up someone that could n't be bothered to wait in the normal line 
 it 's a slower part of the morning in electronics and i see an elderly chinese man waiting near the electronics cash register 
 after asking him if i could help with an electronics purchase he smiled and said he just needs to buy a pack of gum 
 normally i 'd be a little irked but it was slow and this man seemed genuinely nice 
 after ringing up the purchase i hand him his change 
 he looks at it pauses for a second and the conversation goes like this : & gt customer : perhaps i could have newer bills 
 ones that are more crisp 
 & gt me : after a pause ... yeah sure 
 let me see what i can dig out 
 i 'm not sure why he wants newer bills they 're still worth the same amount 
 i 'm guessing he sees the look on my face 
 & gt c : it 's for chinese new year 
 money for my grandchildren 
 otherwise i would n't care what condition it 's in 
 & gt m : ohhhhh ok 
 yeah i think i have some newer bills 
 what animal is it the year of 
 & gt c : the ox 
 & gt m : i think i 'm an ox i was born in <unk> at this point the man 's face lights up 
 & gt c : very good 
 you 'll have amazing luck this year 
 we talk a bit more about it the man is so delighted that he got his new bills and was able to talk about chinese new year with someone that knew very little about it 
 by far my best one on one with a guest ever 
 hey first story : working at a large fast food chain 
 today 2 customers come in 
 they had a coupon <unk> one sausage and egg get a second free '' 
 now the problem with this couple is n't the fact their coupon is over 4 months out of date it 's how they treated me 
 now i 'm not managing so i decide it 's best to just ask the manager on shift if it 's okay they still get their free one 
 i go to tell the couple that i 'm just asking my manager ''no we always get it free 
 always we took a stack of the magazine with the coupon and you always give it to us free you obviously do n't know who we are 
 you do n't have to ask newbie '' 
 i 'm not new i 'm usually just in drive thru 
 i tell them that i 'm asking my manager anyway 
 manager says it 's cool 
 ''okay so that 's 2 sausage and egg and one is free so $ 4 '' the woman looks angry <unk> wrong wrong we want 3 not two '' of course i 'm used to awful customers ''okay $ 8 '' ''no wrong we just gave you a coupon '' 
 ''it 's a coupon for one free with every purchase 
 one free sausage and egg per customer per day '' ''yes so '' 
 ''that means you have to purchase your other one '' <unk> i gave you a coupon '' 
 ''it says buy one get one free 
 you can only have one free '' ''lair i want my 2 free ones 
 do n't you try to cheat me out of this newbie i want 3 '' 
 <unk> is 3 you still have to pay for 2 of them '' <unk> are you being so ridiculous 
 i have a coupon '' finally i go and fish the coupon out the bin and show her <unk> buy one get one free '' ''i do n't see why you ca n't just give me another for free '' <unk> i was actually being nice by giving you the free one anyway with your out of date coupon '' ''you 're new so it 's fine i 'll pay for two '' so short and sweet i work in an australian hardware store where we have a <unk> cutting service 
 so a gentlemen comes up to me asking if he could have his <unk> cut down to <unk> 
 sure that 's fine and i cut it down for him assuming he meant centimeters as he indicated on one of the <unk> with his tape measure 
 anyway turns out what i cut was n't right and the customer was n't satisfied 
 so i show him clearly that i cut it to <unk> by 25cm as he had indicated to which he grabs my tape measure and <unk> out ... 40 centimeters by 25 inches sometimes the customer is wrong.i 've worked in and out of retail for a number of years now and i 've collected a number of stories 
 i currently work for a retailer <unk> in toys and most of the time it 's the best job i 've ever had 
 sometimes though there are people who are out to make our lives miserable 
 on one particular occasion my coworker and i were excited to see a sudden rush of customers carrying large boxes from a certain popular brand of construction blocks 
 it had been a relatively slow day <unk> and the toys were expensive so that many large sales in a row would really <unk> our day 's sales figures 
 i happily start scanning in the first customer 's items while my coworker gets out some of the big bags to fit the items in then i tell the customer the total ... <unk> all hell breaks loose 
 ** & gt customer 1 what 
 that 's not right 
 it 's supposed to be on sale 
 & gt me <unk> i do n't think so ... we do n't have a catalog on at the moment and there 's no sale ticket on the item 
 & gt customer 1 do n't you know anything 
 it 's supposed to be 30 % of brand toy '' today 
 at this point the customers that had been lining up behind customer 1 have slowly moved forward and are <unk> the counter 
 you can practically see the <unk> start to spread as they clutch their large sets 
 they want that discount and are in full support of customer 1. my coworker and i share a glance because this situation is not looking good and we know damn well that there 's no sale on brand toy '' 
 our store is an individual owned retailer and rarely ever does general discounts on product <unk> and that particular brand only ever gets given a general discount in the boxing day sales 
 & gt me are you sure it 's our store doing the sale 
 big department store '' next door has a toy section and they often do big general sales 
 & gt customer 1 yes it 's your store 
 the guy said it was this store 
 the surrounding customers <unk> in with their agreement and my ears prick up 
 & gt me the guy 
 what guy 
 & gt customer 1 *exasperated* the guy 
 the one standing down in the brand toy '' section 
 he said it 's brand toy 's '' <unk> birthday and so toy retailer '' is doing 30 % off all brand toy '' for one day only 
 my coworker and i look at each other again 
 i can tell the same thing is going through both of out minds 
 <unk> 
 ** at this point i turn to try and address all the customers present 
 there was about eight of them all surrounding the counter 
 & gt me i 'm sorry but there seems to be a misunderstanding here 
 neither our store nor brand toy '' have a representative standing in the brand toy '' section 
 that guy has no authority to give out the discounts he 's claiming are available 
 i 'm afraid you 've fallen for a hoax 
 there 's a pause as this news starts to sink in and i start to relax 
 surely logic will <unk> and the customers will realize that they have been tricked through no fault of ours ... yeah and maybe we 'll all laugh and hug and start singing some weird little song showing how today we 've learned not to believe the promises of random strangers /s & gt customer 1 you still have to give me the discount though 
 & gt me <unk> off <unk> ... what 
 & gt customer 1 <unk> straight and smiling smugly* you still have to give me the discount 
 it 's false advertising otherwise 
 some of the other customers at this point have left their brand toy '' on the counter and left but there 's about three more desperate ones clinging on to customer 1 's new argument in the hopes that they can still get 30 % off their sets 
 & gt me but ... <unk> not the ones that are advertising 
 some random guy is 
 & gt customer 1 but we could n't have known that 
 it 's advertising in your store so you have to honor it 
 & gt me <unk> head in disbelief* no it does n't work like that 
 some random guy telling you that you get 30 % off brand toy '' does **not** mean you get 30 % off brand toy '' 
 otherwise we 'd have someone in here every day giving out random discounts 
 & gt customer 1 <unk> <unk> but ... but the guy said 
 & gt me the guy lied 
 & gt customer 1 this is outrageous 
 you ca n't treat your customers like this 
 & gt me i 'm sorry there 's really nothing i can do 
 customer 1 slams his brand toys '' on the counter and starts to storm out 
 & gt customer 1 i 'll be calling consumer affairs about you 
 you 've just lost yourselves a good sale 
 he stormed out kind of slowly as if he expected us to <unk> at those last words and give him the discount 
 i just shrugged and turned back to my remaining customers 
 with their <unk> leader gone they were starting to see their cause was <unk> 
 they piled up their brand toy '' on the counter and started to leave as well 
 a couple gave some <unk> threats about not returning but they left peacefully enough 
 my coworker stepped forward to put down the phone she 'd picked up 
 she 'd been standing behind me ready to call security the whole time in case the customers turned ugly 
 annoyed with the whole situation i left my coworker with the stacked brand toy '' and stormed down the aisle to the brand toy '' section 
 there was no one there 
 i had a look around the shop but it seems that the argument at the counter had scared off all our other customers stupid troll customer included 
 sure i can laugh about it now but at that moment i was **not** a happy person 
 **edit : ** apparently i 'm allowed to say the toy that everyone was after which was <unk> 
 this is only my second post on reddit and i was n't sure if the no names '' rule applied to brands 
 however i 've been told that the no names '' only <unk> to the business that the story occurs in to protect <unk> etc 
 on this particular day i 'm on cash 
 i 'm in the middle of talking to this lovely woman about her purchases and i have a small line of 2 people behind her waiting patiently 
 this late 20 's guy walks up to my register shoves a hat in my face and says price '' 
 i scan the item to give him the price but before handing it back to him i <unk> him by saying next time i 'm going to ask you to hop in line because you just jumped in front of 2 people '' 
 he looked so ashamed 
 he muttered sorry and sulked off 
 about 20 minutes later he came back up waited patiently behind another person and when it was his turn he apologized profusely for his previous <unk> 
 old dogs new tricks etc 
 hello everyone 
 i am back from the gym with another tale 
 i was working yesterday being the good co-worker i am i offered to cover this shift last minute and had a lovely encounter with a seriously <unk> woman sdw : *i was at the desk doing my thing when a middle aged lady approached me 
 * & gt sdw : nepotismx i need your help 
 & gt me : sure what can i help you with 
 & gt sdw : i just dropped my phone in one of the toilets 
 it 's in toilet # 3 
 & gt me : *slight confusion 
 * oh no ... 
 & gt sdw : yes 
 i will come with you and show you so you can get it for me 
 & gt me : uhm i can tell my manager but i am unable to get the phone myself 
 & gt sdw : what 
 why not 
 you work here so go get for me '' 
 & gt me : i am not comfortable doing that and it is not one of my job duties 
 however i will be sure to let the manager know 
 she became irritated and said i was giving her bad customer service 
 thankfully my boss got to deal with the <unk> work at a grocery store 
 as many of you know most stores ca n't accept more than a few dollars in change as they ca n't fit it all in the till 
 we have a <unk> in our store for this reason or if you go to the service counter we will happily roll it for you or give you change in bills 
 <unk> guy walking up to my register with $ 20 worth of food 
 i ring him out and tell him his total 
 he then takes out 5 little baggies of change all mixed up 
 i 'm not sure i can take this much so i call over my service lead 
 me : can i take this much change 
 sl : no our till wo n't hold it and you wo n't be able to count it in a timely manner 
 guy : it 's legal tender you have to take it 
 sl : unfortunately if it ca n't be counted and put in tills in a timely manner we do have the right to refuse it as we are a private business 
 i can take you over to the service counter and give you bill for that if you 'd like 
 guy : no 
 i wan na pay with this cash here 
 get me your manager 
 me : *heavy internal sigh knowing this guy is going to be a huge jackass and make a huge scene and block my till for at least 10 <unk> manager : what seems to be the problem 
 guy : she wo n't take my money 
 it 's legal tender 
 *points to the messy bags* manager : i 'm sorry sir but we ca n't accept this 
 guy : it 's legal tender 
 manager : a private business can accept and refuse some tender 
 guy : <unk> <unk> its legal tender 
 i 'm calling the cops 
 manager : if you wish 
 me go help coworker stock for a while 
 guy : no 
 she has to stay here 
 she needs to be fired 
 so i go help stock and i 'm still up front so i know what happens 
 guy calls the cops bitches about it 's legal tender '' 
 and then get 's arrested for creating a public disturbance 
 i hate the it 's legal tender '' bullshit 
 i ca n't fit $ 10 worth of pennies in my drawer 
 my till is not a <unk> or mary <unk> handbag it will not fit a million coins 
 so fuck you and everyone else who ca n't walk the extra 5 steps to the service counter to get proper change 
 i used to work at video game store 
 i was working a solo shift at this time 
 there we had a section of older used or slightly damaged but still playable games <unk> $ 5 each or $ 3 each if you buy 5 or more 
 well a man came in and decided to buy pretty much all of them - well over 60 games 
 while i was ringing him out and putting the games in the cases a father f and son s walk in 
 the son looks to be in his teens at least <unk> they sort of <unk> to the register effectively blocking the man buying the discount games 
 & gt f : we are looking for blahblah game 
 & gt me : give me just a moment to finish this transaction and i will be right with you 
 & gt s : but i need blahblah game now 
 yes his voice was as <unk> as you are thinking 
 & gt me : and i will be happy to help as soon as i am finished with this gentleman 
 & gt f : we are already at the register 
 he should n't have move 
 he lost his spot in line 
 i look at the customer and he simply rolls his eyes and shakes his head 
 & gt s : get me what i want now 
 & gt f : i demand you let us buy our game first 
 his transaction is going to take too long 
 & gt me : no 
 i will finish his transaction and then i will deal with you 
 now please step away from my counter 
 that is when they decide to leave but not before kicking a glass display and putting a crack in it 
 yelled after them that they were now banned from the store 
 manager had my back when he came in later that <unk> my gas station we allow customers to pump their gas before they pay 
 that 's somewhat unusual in america and our <unk> do n't always understand 
 it 's a normal day and i 'm the only one working the register 
 our <unk> chimes <unk> that a customer outside is requesting to pump then pay inside 
 i look outside to see who it is authorize it and acknowledge them via intercom 
 & gt me : welcome to regional gas station chain 
 i 'll see you inside when you 're done fueling pump 3 '' 
 i go back to ringing up customers 
 i did n't realize that a drama was <unk> outside until a customer said & gt '' <unk> there 's a woman outside trying to get your attention '' 
 i look and see the old woman standing outside her car reaching through her driver 's side window and blaring the horn 
 oh dear god 
 thanks to my retail <unk> powers i immediately knew she was angry 
 but there are customers waiting i ca n't leave and go outside 
 she has to come inside if she wants to <unk> <unk> yell at me 
 guess what she does 
 & gt old lady : are you going to activate the pump for me or not '' 
 & gt me : <unk> '' & gt old lady : it 's like you see me waving my arms 
 you heard the horn 
 hello 
 wake up '' 
 i did hear the horn but i thought it was coming from the road 
 it 's all just background noise after a while you know 
 & gt me : i authorized you to pump when you pressed the pay inside button 
 you 're able to start fueling at any time '' 
 & gt old lady : no you did n't the numbers on the screen still say $ 10.00 
 i 'm not paying for someone else 's gas '' 
 enter my assistant manager who is good at handling people if nothing else 
 & gt am : the pump does n't reset to zero until you start fueling 
 it 's state law 
 that way you always know you start at zero 
 until then it displays the previous transaction 
 here let me help you '' 
 he goes outside with her and helps her with the gas pump 
 when he comes back inside he says & gt am : when that woman comes inside to pay she 's going to apologize to you 
 try to be as nice as possible '' 
 <unk> she actually does 
 & gt old lady : i want to apologize 
 i raised my voice and made a scene 
 no one deserves to be treated like that '' 
 & gt me : it 's okay- '' & gt old lady : no it 's not okay 
 i shouted at you when i should n't have 
 but i 'm glad to know that you accept my apology '' 
 uh ok. i finish her transaction and life goes on 
 never thought i 'd see an angry customer do such a <unk> like that 
 my assistant manager is the real <unk> 
 tl dr : <unk> <unk> 
 this is my first post to this subreddit so forgive me for formatting issues and such 
 so onto the story 
 i used to work at a <unk> arts club but the master was the overly religious type and i simply could n't stand him anymore 
 nice guy and all but i just could n't take it 
 i quit that job and now work at a famous hardware supply store which is perfect for me since i 'm a pretty big guy 6'3 '' and <unk> pounds if i did those <unk> right 
 canadian 
 i enjoy the job but we do get a lot of ... well 
 those customers 
 this story is n't exactly about that 
 so the store had just opened and i 'm already helping people with their items getting things off shelves cutting wood etc 
 when i hear a loud crash from the aisle where we keep all of our nails screws bolts and other small metal objects that are hard to clean up 
 i go to investigate and find six children running around the aisle knocking down shelves full of nails and screws which were now all over the floor 
 needless to say this is a hazard so i tell them to get away from there 
 and then the mother ... <unk> boy 
 their mother who was a rather large woman began to rail at me while walking over that i ca n't tell her kids what to do and that it 's her responsibility 
 & gt me : well that 's fine ma'am but can you please tell them to- & gt her : no 
 they can play if they want 
 i was about to leave it until i heard the sound that we all probably dread in a hardware store one of the kids is crying 
 he could n't have been older than 4 or 5 and he had a 3 inch nail <unk> in his arm 
 he had fallen while playing 
 i frantically get another employee to call 911 while putting pressure on it 
 & gt her : how could you have been such an idiot 
 you let my baby get hurt 
 i attempt to ignore her while i calm the kid down but she will not stop yelling 
 & gt me : ma'am i need you to please calm down you 're scaring the <unk> & gt her : shut up 
 i 'm suing this store once the paramedics get here 
 i was 110 % done with her at this point and i honestly remember her saying a whole bunch of other crazy stuff that i wo n't go into detail about because this was 2 weeks ago 
 needless to say nothing ever came of her lawsuit 
 in fact i believe she was fined or something for criminal negligence 
 not sure really 
 this was my first story out of many i hope the formatting was n't too terrible i used to work as the assistant manager in a small computer store where the management had to be at the store 30 minutes before it opened to get everything ready for the day 
 about 20 minutes before the store opens a guy tries the door which of course was locked 
 he immediately starts pounding on the door and signalling for me to come over 
 i casually walk over to the door and through the closed door i politely explain that the store wo n't be open for another 20 minutes and asked him to come back then 
 this just set him off for some reason or another and the next words out of his mouth are just open the fucking door '' 
 somehow i kept my cool and i again politely explain that we are not yet open and that i would be happy to help him if he came back after the store was open 
 he replies i just need to buy a fucking laptop bag open the fucking door right now '' 
 i explain that we have n't yet prepared the store to accept sales and that he would have to wait until the store was open 
 he replies with that 's fucking bullshit 
 just let me in '' 
 at this point i 'm the only one in the store and there was no way in hell i was going to let him in for any reason 
 i finally told him that i was n't able to help him and started to walk away 
 he starts yelling again you expect me to fucking come back after you would n't let me in '' 
 i turned around and calmly said i 'd prefer you did n't '' then walked back to continue prepping the store 
 he slams his hand on the glass door yells fuck you '' 
 at me then gets into his pickup truck and burns out of the parking <unk> time poster 
 i work in an auto parts store with a small tools section this happened probably 2 months ago now 
 i was tidying shelves in the center of the shop when a customer comes up and informs me that some teenagers seem to be trying to steal something in the paint aisle back corner of the shop 
 i laughed and said not for long '' 
 i moved down and started tidying the aisle next to paints where i could hear them whispering and making a lot of noise with whatever they 're doing 
 i notice them start to leave and rush into the aisle finding a pack of <unk> spanners with 4 missing stashed behind some <unk> cans of thinners 
 i grab the packet and run out of the shop with the intention to just get their licence plate and this is what happened 
 me = m shoplifter = s shoplifters friend = sf i noticed they were only halfway across the carpark 
 m : hey excuse me 
 s : uhh yes.. 
 m : weirdest thing 
 this pack of spanners you were looking at is missing some ... s : oh ... i did n't take them m : no no 
 i never said you did but its so weird because they were like stashed behind some cans on paint ... s : oh ... umm..the rest are there too m : are they 
 i could n't see them 
 do you think you could come back in and show me where they are 
 s : uhh ... yea okay so at this point they both <unk> follow me back in and once inside the shop sf : this is f×××ing ridiculous 
 i have better f×××ing things to do than <unk> around in this <unk> 
 m : it 's okay this wo n't take long we make it back into the paint aisle and i 'm standing about <unk> away from s. he leans over pretending to look behind the cans and tries to <unk> take the spanners out of his pants and hands them to me 
 m : wow 
 what a strange place for them to be 
 so its probably best you leave right now and do n't come back 
 i told coworker 1 who then told the owner in the hopes i 'd be commended 
 owner : <unk> i heard you stopped a shoplifter m : oh yea ... <unk> 's no shoplifting on my watch owner : hmm i bet coworker 2 and 3 would n't do that m : haha yea ... probably not moral of the story 
 sarcasm <unk> <unk> 've worked in customer service for 10 years and i 've had a billion <unk> customer experiences 
 the one thing i 've learned over the years is to kill them with kindness when everything else fails 
 at the end of every encounter i always close with & gt '' i hope your day gets better '' 
 sometimes they snap out of their power trip and apologize 
 so this young guy walks into our shop probably about <unk> and is trying to buy alcohol 
 as per protocol i asked him for id 
 he hands over a driving licence and i look at it 
 & gt me : sir i ca n't accept this & gt him : why not 
 & gt me : well much as i would like to believe you are a 45 year old woman i ca n't accept id that clearly does n't belong to you 
 i return <unk> cute children once more 
 a couple weeks ago the cutest little kid came into the fast food place where i work and since all of us scheduled are female we all converged on the small one 
 me : oh he 's so cute 
 how old is he 
 kid 's dad : he 's two 
 cue small child 
 i wave at child who comes with a wave back function pre-installed 
 very cute 
 me : aww he 's so cute 
 the father and i talk for a bit and he asks me my name 
 me : oh i 'm firelight2 my manager : to the kid do you think she 's pretty 
 small child nods would you like her as your girlfriend 
 child nods vigorously she laughs as she gives him his small <unk> and says : here you go 
 to me she says now you ca n't deny having a boyfriend 
 he 's a regular and comes in all the time now 
 he gave me a random screw he found on the floor 
 and i gave him a nugget 
 so i thought y'all would enjoy hearing about my small 2 year old boyfriend '' who comes with a pre-installed wave back function is very small and gives nice hugs 
 edit : to make it <unk> the kid gave me the screw he found on the floor not the father 
 sorry 
 i am confusing 
 and yes i am the one from stop flirting she has a boyfriend '' 
 <unk> i 'm a cake decorator at new england supermarket 
 today a woman walked into the bakery with one of the most adorable kids i 've ever seen and i do n't like kids 
 the woman says she needs to order a cake for monday morning 
 no <unk> i walk them through the ordering process 
 the woman seems a bit <unk> and has a bit of an attitude but nothing too major 
 & gt me : what flavor cake would you like 
 we have vanilla chocolate <unk> or we can do half chocolate half vanilla 
 & gt woman to her kid : what kinda cake you want 
 & gt little girl : chocolate cake 
 <unk> smile* & gt woman : \*makes a face* chocolate cake 
 i do n't want chocolate cake 
 we 'll do vanilla 
 & gt me : you could do a half chocolate half vanilla cake 
 & gt woman : <unk> her <unk> fine we 'll do that 
 a few minutes pass as we discuss what sort of frosting and <unk> they want on the cake 
 the woman asserts many times that she does n't want chocolate frosting 
 then out of nowhere ... & gt woman : i changed my mind we 're getting an all vanilla cake 
 no chocolate 
 & gt little girl : but mommy -- & gt woman : no 
 i do n't want no chocolate cake 
 & gt little girl : <unk> fucking face ever but says <unk> & gt me : <unk> smile* it 's really no problem to do <unk> cakes we do them all the time 
 there 's plenty of vanilla cake in them 
 & gt woman : nah nah just vanilla 
 as we finish the order the kid is completely <unk> 
 she does n't complain or anything despite being only 6 years old or so 
 i can tell this is n't the first time mom 's pulled something like this 
 i 'll be the one making this cake on monday 
 you bet your ass i 'm gon na screw it up '' and make it half vanilla half chocolate consequences be damned 
 at first i thought it could be allergy related but it was clearly a case of mom being a <unk> bitch 
 worst case scenario they get the cake for free and the little girl actually gets the birthday cake she wanted 
 <unk> : i 've decided to make the cake vanilla as ordered and give the little girl a free chocolate cupcake instead 
 that way <unk> can have her cake and the poor little girl can eat her 's too 
 part 2 roll back to when i worked at $ fastfood end of the night just before graveyard crew rolls in 
 $ shiftmanager has <unk> our frap machine and is cleaning it 
 this machine is fairly simple in operation but a bitch to clean 
 we put ice in the top it chew it up and spits it into a cup after mixing it with the coffee flavor goo 
 lots of little parts and tubes involved 
 <unk> me : welcome to my personal hell how my i help you 
 $ oblivious : yes i 'd like to have an iced mocha 
 me : sure thing that 'll be $ price $ ************************************* *note : * we served a drink called a mocha frap which we could n't make and would not be able to make for at least 45 minutes since the machine was in pieces and being cleaned 
 we also served a drink called an iced mocha which is iced coffee with chocolate and <unk> in it 
 that 's what this guy ordered but apparently not what he wanted 
 <unk> guy pulls to the window i hand him his coffee and smiles then looks at his drink and frowns 
 $ oblivious : i do n't think i ordered this 
 $ me : i 'm sorry about that just to make sure what was it that you ordered 
 $ oblivious : iced mocha $ me : that is this the iced mocha sir 
 iced coffee with mocha 
 a few minutes of this and my manager gets off the floor where she 's cleaning out the bottom portion of the machine housing and asks what 's up 
 guy looks at her and asks for an iced mocha $ no-bullshitmanager : sir that is the iced mocha i watched him make it no mistakes were made 
 $ oblivious : oh okay 
 <unk> he parks his car and walks <unk> guy walks up and does n't seem to recognize either of us the only two employees in the front of the store second manager was in back handling paperwork $ oblivious : i wanted an iced mocha i think a mistake was made 
 $ nbm : sir that 's the only kind of drink that we serve right now that is both iced and is a mocha 
 $ oblivious : no it 's not 
 i wanted my ice crushed and mixed in 
 all frothy like 
 nbm : sir that would be a mocha <unk> 
 that machine is down right now i 'm cleaning it we are physically unable to make it for you 
 $ oblivious : well i wanted an iced mocha and now it 's all warm and the ice has melted 
 $ nbm : <unk> make him another one she said that in a tone that read as i want him the fuck out this guy 's a dumbass i make him the iced coffee and hand it to him 
 he now has two ice <unk> 
 he looks at his iced coffee and he looks at us 
 $ oblivious : but i wanted it with all the ice crushed up and stuff the <unk> thing you said 
 $ nbm : sir do you see all these parts i 'm cleaning right here in front of you 
 these are the parts for the machine that <unk> the ice and mix it with the coffee goo 
 we 're not making any of those for at least 45 minutes to an hour 
 $ oblivious : <unk> okay 
 but ca n't you just make the one with the crushed ice 
 i want a refund 
 $ nbm : no 
 we 've already made you two drinks 
 we physically can not make a frap or smoothie 
 no refund for you 
 then he just pouted and walked out 
 at my store we do n't have the option of choosing to run cards as credit or debit on our machines 
 if customers use a debit card and want to run it as credit they swipe the card and a screen pops up in the pinpad asking for their pin with a button on the side that says credit '' if they want to run it as credit 
 i get a few people every day telling me to run their cards as credit and i just tell them to hit the button and there is no issue 
 lady comes to check out 
 late 20s early 30s 
 i ring her up tell her the total 
 this is credit '' she says 
 oh just swipe your card and hit the credit button when it asks for your pin i ca n't run it as credit on my computer '' 
 she swipes her card and the pin screens comes up 
 she pauses 
 i said credit '' 
 yes just hit the credit button on the <unk> '' ignoring me she types in her pin and hits accept 
 i said credit you know '' 
 you just have to hit the credit button i ca n't chose on my computer '' 
 i. said 
 credit '' 
 she takes her bag and storms off leaving me terribly terribly <unk> years ago i was the sales manager at a dealership for well known american made motorcycle 
 one day i was walking through the motorcycles on the showroom floor 
 i did this every day to make sure the correct price tags were hanging from the <unk> and to see if any of the bikes needed some attention from the detail guy 
 on this particular day the dealership looked empty 
 this was pretty normal for a winter weekday but it was ghost town empty 
 while i was in the middle of all of the motorcycles i suddenly felt the need to pass gas 
 i thought nothing of it beings the dealership looked empty ... so i let it go 
 the dealership was n't empty 
 somehow a customer had come through the doors unnoticed and was crouched down in between a couple of the motorcycles looking at the engine 
 nobody saw him ... including me 
 when i let out what can only be described as a duck call his head popped up like a <unk> out of his hole 
 no expression ... no laughter ... just uncomfortably awkward eye contact 
 i proceeded to walk over to my office and instructed one of my sales guys to take care of the surprise guest 
 he ended up purchasing one and i being the <unk> 
 took care of <unk> the deal and doing his financial paperwork 
 nothing was said regarding my temporary indiscretion during this entire process 
 when the sale was <unk> and the customer was the happy owner of a brand new american made motorcycle i shook his hand and told him congratulations 
 it was at that moment he looked me square in the eye and said i heard that '' 
 he then gave a <unk> smile and went on his happy way.i used to work at a small supermarket and i did n't like one of the supervisors who we 'll call <unk> thanks to this incident 
 anyway it was an incredibly busy time of the day there were stacks and stacks of customers all lining up at once with their <unk> 
 i was ordering change for my drawer because i had been asked to serve and the person who was on there before me did n't order anything 
 i had a few $ <unk> notes and a couple of <unk> 
 anyway this lady comes up to me and asks if i 'm open i say sorry i 'm not open right now i need to order the change for this register first 
 you 're welcome to wait if you want it wo n't take longer than five minutes '' 
 the lady smiled said no that 's okay dear i 'll line up somewhere else '' 
 just as she 's walking away birdie storms up to me and yells 
 birdie : exactly what are you doing 
 it 's busy and you 're not open '' 
 i tried to explain but no birdie would not have that at all 
 nope no excuses 
 you listen here : you have a job to do and that job is to serve customers '' 
 she turned to the lady 
 excuse me miss she will serve you right now 
 i 'm sorry '' 
 birdie then shook her head at me and stormed back to the fast lane 
 the lady smiled at me and started loading her items 
 i asked her if she had a card on her and she explained that she only had cash 
 i smiled when she handed over her money and i could n't give her the right change 
 i called birdie over the speakers and when she got there she asked what i 'd done wrong 
 i told her that i did n't have enough change 
 birdie : why did n't you check for change earlier '' 
 me : i did but you told me to serve '' 
 i wish that i could properly explain the expression on her face 
 her eyes widened comically before she gained composure 
 she apologised to the customer for the trouble and took her to another register 
 for the rest of that shift birdie would avoid having any contact with me 
 i just found this sub and i 'm so excited to be able to share my stories with people who will understand 
 sorry about the format i 'm on my tablet 
 i work at a big chain craft and hobby store i specifically work in the framing and fabric departments 
 this store has weekly sales and the merchandise that goes on sale usually alternates every other week 
 which is super annoying because customers do n't understand why they ca n't have an item for 50 % off this week when they know it 'll be 50 % off next week 
 so last week i was working in the framing department and helping a customer pick a custom frame 
 then another customer henceforth <unk> rude guy '' came up with some posters that needed framing and started walking through the ready-made frames available 
 then the rude guy came over and interrupted us 
 <unk> and rg=rude guy rg : are you telling me these pointing to the ready made wall frames are n't on sale this week 
 me : no sir the open back frames and shadowboxes are on sale this week 
 i 'll be happy to help you in just a minute 
 rg : so these pointing to the wall frames are n't ready made frames 
 me : yes sir they are ready made frames if they 're are n't built by us personally then they are considered ready made frames 
 this guy is speaking pretty aggressively so my current customer said she would wait while i helped answer the rude guy 's questions 
 she 's a nice lady 
 rg : the ad said these frames are on sale this week 
 me : those frames were on sale last week this week the open back frames and shadowboxes are on sale 
 maybe you saw last week 's ad by mistake 
 rg : i just looked it up online 
 me : i 'm sorry for the confusion sir 
 but the wall frames are n't on sale this week the open back frames and shadowboxes are 
 the wall frames go on sale very frequently so you can check back next week 
 rg : pulls up the sales ad on his phone see 
 it says ready made frames 50 % off 
 me : sir it says ready made open back frames and ready made shadowboxes are on sale 
 these are <unk> as ready made wall frames and they 're not on sale this week 
 rg : you guys are a bunch of fucking lying bitches 
 me sounding super <unk> : oh well okay then 
 rg : i 'll just go spend my money at name of competitive store 
 me : i 'm sure they 'll enjoy having you there just as much as i have 
 big fake smile resume pleasant interaction with nice lady customer who called corporate and gave me a glowing review 
 my favorite part of these types of exchanges are how they think they 're going to hurt my feelings by saying they 're going to go shop somewhere else 
 really i 'm devastated 
 edit : formattingso back when i worked in the electronics dept 
 of a regional supermarket chain i encountered some interesting people 
 figured i 'd share here 
 first one will be brief 
 woman comes in carrying what appears to be a cell phone 
 she says the battery is dead and she needs a new one 
 we do n't sell cellphone batteries and i told her so 
 she decides to hand me the phone so i can check 
 i flip it to the back after fiddling around with it for a while and find it does take double aa batteries 
 i was shocked but just kinda shrugged it off 
 i go pick her up some and ring her out she decides to put the batteries in on the spot 
 oh she also decided to finally tell me she handed me a stun gun meant to look like a cellphone 
 it still had some juice too 
 so if handing an <unk> person a dangerous weapon is n't bad enough she decides to test to see if the batteries work in the store 
 she fires off the stun gun before i even have a chance to stop her and the entire department just goes quiet at the loud crack '' 
 best part was that loss prevention security was standing in the area too and came running over 
 i do n't think she was allowed back in the store 
 tldr woman comes in hands me a stun gun without telling me and then proceeds to make sure it works again by firing it off in the store 
 it was a slow day at my gas station 
 customers were few and far between as i ran the register 
 my intercom beeps informing me that the customer on pump # 5 need help 
 i press the button and give a cheery & gt me : what can i do for you today '' 
 & gt intercom : there 's something wrong with my pump 
 can you come take a look '' 
 & gt me : sure i 'll be right out '' 
 so i walk out to the pump and notice two things 
 first the customer on pump # 5 is a girl in her early 20 's 
 second is the strong smell of gasoline 
 i know exactly where this is going 
 & gt me : what seems to be the trouble '' 
 & gt girl : i do n't know i tried to hang up the pump but something sprayed out of my gas tank '' 
 i look down and the side of her car and the ground have a decent bit of gas on them 
 nothing dangerous but its very obvious 
 & gt me : ok nothing to worry about its just some gas 
 when you pull the nozzle out just make sure that you are n't squeezing the handle '' 
 & gt girl : <unk> that gas '' 
 & gt me : yes ... '' & gt girl : are you sure that 's gas 
 why did it spray out of my tank '' 
 & gt me : oh its definitely gas and this happens some times 
 like i said just make sure not to squeeze the handle when you 're pulling it out of your tank and you 'll be fine '' 
 i demonstrate this for her by hanging the pump up normally 
 & gt girl : that 's crazy are you sure that 's gas '' 
 & gt me : well if that 's not gas coming out of my gas pumps i have a much bigger problem than a little spill right now '' 
 & gt girl : oh ok if you say so ... '' she then got in her car and drove <unk> several years i worked in the produce department of my local grocery store long enough to see kale go from a <unk> to every soccer-mom 's favorite <unk> 
 one day a woman comes up to me and wants to know if there is any kale out back because she did not see any in the display 
 i knew i had just seen some there so i walk over to the greens case and sure enough there are about a dozen bunches of kale 
 me : here you go ma'am 
 woman : no that 's not what i want i 'm looking for <unk> 
 me confused : um this *is* kale 
 woman : well that 's not what i 'm looking for 
 me : then you 're not looking for kale 
 woman : no kale has big flat leaves 
 it does n't me thinking for two seconds : are you thinking of collard greens 
 i walk to the collard greens eight feet to the left woman looking all smug : ah just what i 'm looking for kale 
 me : & amp # 3232 & amp # 3232 <unk> another time a regular asked me if there was any kale out back 
 i bring out a case and let him have his pick 
 while he is going through it some woman starts asking him how he likes to prepare it 
 he replies with it 's not for me it 's for my lizards 
 they love this stuff 
 after finally getting a rather large queue down to one person i arrive at the last customer at my customer service desk 
 this customer will here on in be known as <unk> that change hardly '' 
 & gt me : hi there how can i help 
 & gt btch : hi i 'd like to exchange some lingerie 
 & gt me : that should be fine but clothing returns must be done upstairs in the clothing department 
 & gt btch : really 
 & gt me : sorry 
 after six we take over clothing returns but for now you 'll have to pop upstairs 
 she nods and another customer stands behind her 
 & gt me : is everything ok 
 & gt btch : i 'm still waiting for my exchange 
 & gt me : and as i just mentioned you 'll have to go upstairs 
 & gt btch : well i 'm not walking upstairs when this is the returns desk 
 firstly its the customer service desk and i 've got things other than returns to deal with 
 secondly there are n't even stairs to walk up 
 there is a travelator around the corner or a lift you could take 
 <unk> ... screw it i 'll do your refund 
 i want my moment of <unk> zen 
 & gt me : ok then 
 do you have a receipt 
 & gt btch : no 
 & gt me : no problem 
 do you have the products you 'd like to exchange these lingerie for with you 
 & gt btch : no just put it on a gift card 
 you ... you 've done this before 
 if i 've <unk> anything its that knowing our refund policy well usually means you try to abuse the system somehow 
 i 'm now in <unk> mode 
 & gt me : that 's fine 
 there 's no price tags on the lingerie which means they 've been used 
 that 's not an issue but having to find the codes on the clothing tags and typing them all manually is going to take a while 
 two people join the queue 
 some of the codes on the lingerie work but most are n't on the system ... and this lady has a lot of lingerie 
 this suggests that some of these are old so old that they are n't in warranty anymore 
 & gt me : when did you buy these lingerie 
 & gt btch : last month 
 you ... you did n't 
 even product <unk> remain on the system past the warranty <unk> so you ca n't pull that one 
 ok let 's go down the <unk> hole of playing returns detective 
 & gt me : most of these are n't on the system suggesting that they were bought so long ago that they are n't currently under warranty 
 & gt btch : i 'm telling you now that i bought all of them in december 
 how else have some went through 
 & gt me : <unk> <unk> btch 
 if some are on the system that means they must be under warranty 
 yet i know you 're up to something 
 <unk> 
 & gt me : are any of the items damaged 
 & gt btch : no they 're all fine 
 damn it 
 i can usually tell when they 're lying but she seems to be telling the truth 
 try another line of questioning 
 & gt me : did you buy them all at once 
 do you know when 
 how did you pay 
 & gt btch : yeah but i do n't know when i bought them or how 
 so at this point i 'm winning 
 i 'm not obliged to give her anything as she ca n't even prove her side or that she even purchased them 
 i try to look busy as i come up with another way to deal with this 
 one more person <unk> my queue 
 & gt me : why are you bringing the products back 
 wrong colour or style 
 & gt btch : no they 're just the wrong <unk> & gt me : <unk> 
 her face said it all 
 she had changed breast size and no offence but just by looking at her trolley contents you could see why 
 none of her lingerie fit anymore so she 's trying to swap for a bigger size for free 
 i ai n't got an issue with that if they 're on the system but your trying to change your whole wardrobe for nothing 
 & gt me : unfortunately i ca n't do anything with the ones not on the system 
 & gt btch : well this is shocking 
 i 'm a customer here and i deserve an exchange 
 & gt me : the issue is- & gt btch : let me finish 
 ... ... ... you do n't actually have anything to say do you 
 & gt me : the <unk> & gt btch : it says on the label that it comes from this store 
 how can you not exchange it 
 & gt me : that 's not the issue 
 the issue is that i ca n't process the items as a <unk> & gt btch : but i want an exchange 
 & gt me : let me finish 
 i need to be able to process the items as a refund on the system so that i can use the current selling value of these items to cover the cost of your new products thus <unk> an exchange 
 they are n't on the system which immediately suggests that it 's out of warranty and i ca n't just add some money as a random refund because i a would be breaking a ton of times and b have no idea what the value of all these products are 
 <unk> this issue might even be <unk> if you could prove you purchased the products i.e 
 a receipt but you do n't have that to back it up 
 for all i know these products could be more than a year old 
 silence ... other than the sound of two more people joining the queue 
 now you know what 's coming do n't you 
 & gt btch : can i speak to a manager 
 & gt me : the clothing manager is n't in today 
 & gt btch : well i 'll speak to their manager 
 & gt me : he should be available 
 so the manager 's manager comes down to speak with the lady 
 i briefly explained what was going on over the phone 
 he 's pretty helpful for his position and takes no crap whatsoever 
 he basically runs through what i 've said in a less sympathetic more <unk> manner 
 i mean the guy is too busy to be dealing with this 
 he says he will take her details and will have the clothing manager contact her 
 & gt btch : well why did n't you just do that at the start 
 i lean over the counter staring at her glancing at the now 10-long queue and stare back again 
 i whisper & gt me : because you wanted an exchange remember 
 & gt btch : i 'm going to contact your headquarters 
 more prepared than i have ever been i whip out a piece of paper with the hq number on it 
 & gt btch : you have these prepared huh 
 she snickers 
 & gt me : nope first one 
 i just knew you 'd want it 
 that 's what good customer service - knowing what you want and giving you what you deserve 
 i await a follow-up.hello tfr 
 this will be my first post <unk> i figured that when the customer service desk employees started regularly asking me if i had any new crazy stories to tell them i should start posting them too 
 i work in the electronics department of a large national retail chain that sells a little of everything 
 so a middle-aged male guest approaches me and asks to check out all 's well so far 
 he 's a bit <unk> but customers being less than polite is old news 
 right off the bat he tells me very firmly : & gt him : i want to use up this prepaid visa so i 'm splitting the payment '' 
 this is of course totally fine and i assure him so in my best retail <unk> 
 he continues very seriously & gt him : there 's only a penny on here but i 'm not going to throw away good money 
 you ca n't expect to win the lottery if you just throw money away '' 
 i give a polite laugh at this it 's ... a strange enough phrase that i have to assume it 's a joke despite his intensely <unk> face 
 i ring up his purchases and he then hands me an employee discount card to scan as well -- <unk> not one that belongs to him according to the very <unk> name listed so i assume it 's a significant other which explains why he does n't know why this is a problem 
 & gt me : sir unfortunately if you use an employee discount you can only pay using cash or our store credit/debit card '' 
 he stares at me 
 i must clarify 
 & gt me : i ca n't accept the prepaid card as a payment if you want to use the discount '' 
 this should n't be a problem right 
 i mean the discount is 10 % off way more than a single cent 
 & gt him : i told you i want to use this card 
 it 's money 
 even if it 's just a penny it 's my money 
 you ca n't expect to win the lottery if you just throw money away '' 
 & gt me : i understand that sir 
 unfortunately you have to use only cash or the store card to pay when you use an employee discount '' 
 & gt him : why wo n't you take my money 
 it 's still legal 
 it 's a good penny '' 
 & gt me : sir ... as much as i want to help you the register will not accept it '' 
 & gt him : run it anyway '' 
 oookay 
 sometimes people just have to see the error message themselves i suppose 
 i dutifully punch the keys he swipes the prepaid card and the register helpfully displays the can not accept this payment with an employee discount '' message 
 i turn the screen to show him and he looks even more angry 
 & gt him : fine 
 go back and take the employee discount off '' 
 & gt me : ... sir i would be happy to do that for you but you understand that using the discount would save you more money 
 you could just save the prepaid card and use it another time somewhere else -- '' & gt him : do n't talk back to me just do it '' 
 alright 
 who am i to argue with such a pleasant request 
 i go back and void the discount barcode then tell him his new total 
 he angrily swipes the prepaid visa <unk> it in half and throws it over my head towards the trash can behind me 
 classy 
 & gt him : there was it that hard 
 i just want to use my money 
 you ca n't win the lottery -- '' you all know how this goes 
 then he hands me the employee discount card again 
 i stare at it then at him 
 & gt him : well 
 add the discount to the total now '' 
 & gt me : sir ... i ca n't 
 i told you the register wo n't let you use a discount card with payments that are n't cash or the store card '' 
 & gt him : well i used the stupid card already so now you can discount what 's left '' 
 & gt me : sir you see the discount card is a barcode ... i have to scan it back at the items screen which means in order to go back and add it again i need to void your prior payments 
 that 's why i warned you to save your prepaid card for another time and just use the discount instead '' 
 he stares at me then stares over at the trash can where his now ruined visa sits 
 & gt him : i ca n't believe i threw good money away anyway after all that '' 
 he grumbled to himself a little finally paid in cash and left 
 too bad he 'll never win the lottery <unk> it 's just about closing time on a friday night at my store and as usual i 'm the closing manager 
 i do n't know why this happens but we always get super busy in the last hour… maybe it 's because people go out to eat then want to go somewhere and arbitrarily unfold things that they are n't going to buy 
 no telling 
 at about 15 minutes before close a group of 5 teenagers come in all obnoxious and loud 
 my associates and i kick on our amazing customer service skills and try to help them the hell out of the store before we close 
 one girl finally picks a few items then comes up to the register to pay 
 i jump on register and ring her up 
 i tell her the total and it happens 
 she holds up her iphone showing me a grainy picture of a credit card 
 i have this '' she snottily says you can just type it in '' 
 <unk> i 'm gon na need the actual card in the store '' i say my brain making <unk> popping noises in reaction to the situation that is beginning to transpire 
 her nose <unk> 
 i 've never seen this before in real life but i swear it <unk> 
 it 's my mom 's card and she said i can use it '' she says in a <unk> voice 
 so you 're telling me that you expect to use a cellphone picture of someone else 's card as payment '' 
 i ask incredulously 
 <unk> 
 uhhhhh <unk> '' she answers her voice doing that annoying <unk> <unk> on the <unk> syllable 
 that 's not a valid form of payment '' i loudly pronounce 
 her friends who have been tearing up the <unk> items a few feet behind her get really quiet 
 i 'm going to need your mom physically in the store to complete the purchase unless you have money of your own '' 
 she makes an even <unk> face 
 ugh '' 
 she exclaims why will no one take this '' 
 she stomps out her laughing friends following her out the door 
 i quickly check my watch confirm that it 's exactly 9pm and lock it behind them 
 i have no idea why anyone thought this would actually work 
 when i was in high school i worked for a fast food burger chain 
 one night i was working on the assembly table making burgers and my coworker was working the fryers 
 i was doing some cleaning around keeping busy so that i would n't get sent home since it was a slow night 
 then my manager steps out of the office and says guys you wo n't believe what this woman just called to complain about '' 
 this is how he says the phone call went down : manager : fast food burgers how can i help you 
 woman : there was a used condom in my kid 's cheeseburger 
 manager : ma'am could you repeat that 
 woman : one of your employees put a used condom in my kid 's cheeseburger 
 i opened it to take off the pickles and there was a used condom sitting there manager : uhhh ... ok i 'll see if anyone confesses to their crime 
 please hold 
 let 's the phone sit on hold for a few mins because he knows she 's lying manager : ma'am my employees want to know if it was a magnum <unk> 
 woman : what 
 no it 's not 
 why would they ask that 
 manager : they want to let you know that it 's not it did n't belong to any of them woman : your corporate office will be hearing about this *click* to this day they 're still waiting on that call from corporate ... edit : holy shit 
 i got gold for this 
 thank you kind redditor for gifting my first gold 
 edit2 : i got tfr quote of the day '' 
 you guys are awesome 
 i do n't know who decides that but thanks i work at a coffee shop on campus at a bible college 
 so my customers are bible college students 
 a while back a girl comes to the register to order her drink 
 i take her order and head into the kitchen to make it 
 while i 'm doing so i hear some change <unk> and papers shuffling 
 so i come back to register and this girl was taking money out of our tip jar 
 when confronted she said well you should n't leave it here ... '' 
 -_-this happened last night and i 'm so totally <unk> out 
 fuck okay so i work in a clothing store and my coworker was working in the fitting room 
 i was called there to cover her for her 15. i ask how many inside '' 
 i just like to know how many to expect coming out of the fitting rooms 
 she says three women and one man ... '' she leans in to whisper the man has been in so long ... .i worry '' 
 i 'm like okay 
 enjoy your break '' 
 so about 10 mins go by and the guy comes out 
 he 's short 50s and <unk> as a newborn 
 his face is red and sweaty and i notice the clothes he 's tried on are crumpled in a ball in his arms and i 'm mildly annoyed as most customers do n't bother putting the stuff back on the hangers 
 anyway he gives me his number and high <unk> it out of there 
 i <unk> the clothes on the counter when my hand touches something wet 
 that 's when i screamed 
 the clothes were covered in <unk> 
 i guess he had been pleasuring himself while wearing the pants and the most fucked up part 
 there was a little purple dress from the kid 's department at the center of the clothes with <unk> on the front 
 i was kind of glad it was me who found it and not my coworker 
 she 's this tiny old lady who really would have freaked out i was disgusted i called my manager who is always calm in any situation 
 she says what the fuck 
 what the hell '' 
 she called the cops and it turns out there 's been a dude doing this all over the city 
 the <unk> <unk> struck again 
 <unk> edit for clarification : when i say <unk> i 'm referring to the number paddles we give customers upon entering the fitting room 
 if he had given me his phone number i obviously would have given it to the cops.ok so this is n't my story but my <unk> however i found it funny and wanted to share it 
 so my mum m was on tills yesterday and her first customer was an elderly gentleman 
 after processing the man 's sale and receiving payment the customers wife came up to the till and noticed that he had bought something he should n't have - man 's wife : you bought chocolate 
 it is only the second of january and you have bought chocolate 
 i ca n't believe you bought chocolate 
 i 'll just get the girl to return this 
 the man turned round and simply replied : you had vodka yesterday 
 if you can have vodka i can have chocolate 
 edit : spelling i just posted a story a few days ago but something today had me on the <unk> '' so i just had to share this amazing employee fail i saw today 
 so me and my co-worker are up front as cashiers on a slow day 
 we get a very pretty muslim girl and so my co-worker tells me that he got this customer 
 i let him take her and i continued to put away clothes that customers returned 
 the next few things i heard were just unbelievable ... also just an fyi my co-worker is one of those stereotypical douche bags who care too much about their <unk> is a hard core player cares more about his car than his <unk> and is a total homophobic 
 co-worker cw : hello there 
 may i interest you in a rewards card 
 her : oh no thank you i 'm just here to make a small purchase 
 cw : excuse me miss if you do n't mind me asking as to why a beautiful girl like you is wearing one of those allah scarfs 
 are those allah scarfs hip now 
 you should take it off a beautiful girl like you should n't be wearing something like that 
 i literally dropped everything just to turn around and hear what that girl was going to respond with 
 her : this allah scarf is called a <unk> 
 i wear it for religious reasons 
 i also wear it so that men can like and respect me for who i am and not how i look 
 also if you are trying to get with me you 're wasting your time because i know i can do much better than you 
 now if you will be so kind as to get your manager so that i my report your ignorance to him or her 
 thank you 
 my cw looked at me thinking i would help him out 
 i actually left the front as soon as the manager came up went to the rest room and just laughed my ass off until my stomach got <unk> 
 he got fired on the spot 
 edit : changed <unk> to muslim for <unk> hi guys 
 story time 
 so roughly 2 years ago i became an office manager at a fairly large grocery store 
 basically an office manager handles the refunds counts the money from the tills and answers the phone 
 around the same time that i was promoted our store had just finished remodeling 
 most of our customers and employees loved our remodel 
 this customer however did not 
 me = m angry lady = al *phone rings & amp i answer it* & gt m : thanks for calling store '' how may i help you 
 & gt al : hi i 'd like to speak to a manager please 
 & gt m : that would be me 
 how may i help you 
 & gt al : you 've ruined your store 
 well this is n't going to be fun ... & gt m : i 'm sorry 
 & gt al : i was in there earlier and i could n't find the shake 'n bake 
 it used to be on aisle 8 but it 's not there anymore 
 & gt m : i 'm sorry about that 
 could i put you on hold for just a moment 
 i 'll be right back 
 & gt al : sure 
 so i went over to aisle 8. guess what 
 that 's exactly where her precious shake 'n bake was 
 so i went back into my office and took her off hold 
 & gt m : ma'am i just went over to aisle 8 and found it 
 are you sure you did n't just miss it 
 apparently that was not the best thing to say ... & gt al : i 've been going to your store for years 
 do you really think i would miss it if it was there 
 she then goes on to rant for <unk> fucking minutes** about how we 've ruined our store by remodeling it and that she 'd never shop there again i was n't exactly upset by hearing this 
 & gt m : well i 'm sorry you had such a bad experience with us today 
 i hope you have a wonderful day 
 & gt al : fuck you asshole 
 *click* i then mentioned this little exchange with my store manager and we spent the rest of the day joking back and forth about our grand scheme to hide her shake 'n <unk> was working a shift at my part-time job at everyone 's favorite 15/20/30 % coupon store ... .and this lady l '' came up to my register with about 4 different items of clothing she was purchasing 
 i began ringing her up 
 & gt l - um those pants are 50 % <unk> rang up full price '' 
 & gt me - yes ma'am 
 they are buy one/get one 50 % off 
 the second pair would be 50 % off 
 & gt l - no the sign said 50 % 
 this is ridiculous every time i am in here y'all try to screw me over 
 i know how to read signs 
 & gt me - not really wanting to argue but not willing to call a manager over for something so stupid i am happy to give you 25 % off this item if it will help since these bogo pants are all the same price 
 & gt l - see there it is 
 i 'm not stupid 
 i want this for half off or i 'm not going to buy it 
 complete crazy person breakdown about to begin ... & gt me - so you do n't want it 
 i can go ahead and delete the item for you 
 she was fine with this still grumbling when i began to scan a shirt 
 it rang up 50 % off which was correct 
 & gt l - okay see 
 that 's ringing up half off 
 my other item should have too 
 & gt me - ma'am those are two different items 
 this is a shirt the other item was pants 
 she proceeded to have me keep that item in her purchase gave me her rewards card and began to make payment on the item when it hit me 
 i knew her 
 & gt me - do n't you go to blah blah '' church 
 i think i know you from there 
 she had this deer-in-the-headlights look and confirmed that yes she did indeed go to this church 
 anyone care to guess how quickly she turned from vinegar into sickeningly sweet syrup 
 i could have gotten <unk> 
 it 's amazing how people will show their true <unk> when they do n't think anybody they know might be <unk> i have a story a day for you guys 
 previous tales can be found here and here lets see how long i can keep finding things to post for you guys 
 so i 'm sick as all hell today 
 i 'm setting up the new <unk> layout for my store in between doing an inventory count and <unk> violently in the bathroom which is a 30 second run down the hall 
 while i had my head in the automatic <unk> toilet i remembered something that happened one of the first times i ever opened my store by myself 
 i had just finished an inventory count and i had a rather shady looking man come in to the kiosk 
 now this in and of itself was n't too out of the ordinary 
 i was in a shady area before being transferred to the kiosk i now work at 
 i was also hung over and i was pretty sure at that point i was dying 
 it was about 9:30 am and our store opened at 10:00 am 
 & gt **shady dude : ** give me your phones 
 & gt **me : ** dude you got ta wait till we 're opened 
 i ca n't just give you phones 
 i 'm not open yet 
 half an hour 
 & gt **shady dude : ** no 
 i want all of your phones 
 now 
 & gt **me : ** still not cluing in yeah i get it you want phones 
 you have to wait until my store is open just like everyone else 
 & gt **shady dude : ** now confused no 
 <unk> me your fucking phones** & gt **me : ** not with that attitude 
 now fuck off 
 i 'm trying to open my store 
 i think i confused the poor guy because he kinda just stood there until security and the cops showed up 
 i guess one of the stores beside me realized what was going on and thought i was just stalling until someone called for help 
 i honestly did n't even realize what was going on 
 looking back on it now it <unk> me because that could 've turned out a lot different than it did 
 i also kind of giggle because i think that that 's the first time a hang over from hell might 've saved me.i worked in the electronics department of a major retailer 
 however this particular retailer also included books and media as part of electronics 
 this first part is n't the main story but the set up 
 because only those who have had to maintain electronics and books know how rough it is 
 even though it 's <unk> a small department keeping stuff like cds organized is a nightmare 
 the true terror though is the kid 's book aisle 
 for whatever reason kid 's hands are always sticky 
 it does n't matter if they 've just been washed they 're already sticky again 
 and working in a large retail store parents tend to get so distracted by everything they do n't always keep an eye on their kids 
 or they just do n't care what <unk> their kid brings 
 so i 'm organizing the kids book section and this little kid is following right behind me undoing everything i 'm doing 
 the mom is talking loudly on her cellphone and ca n't be bothered to watch her kid 
 pretty sure i saw him stick a lollipop in one book and pull another lollipop out of a different book not really but that 's a theory as to why they 're always sticky 
 so in the middle of what can best be described as the <unk> of retail punishment i hear a man yell from <unk> away & gt hey you 
 hey 
 i 'm talking to you '' 
 i figure it 's a guest yelling at another guest 
 then i hear it again 
 & gt excuse you 
 listen up '' 
 and he snaps his fingers 
 i finally look over and see what can best be described as a douchier version of guy fieri 
 loud 
 fat 
 frosted tips 
 wearing his <unk> sunglasses in the store 
 he snaps at me again and <unk> i come over to him 
 henceforth he 'll be referred to as <unk> 
 so i put on my mask of friendliness and ask how i can help him 
 & gt me : how may i help you 
 & gt c : about time you got over here 
 no wonder you 're working here and not a real job 
 i need one of them <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> 
 mhd 
 whatever they are ... & gt me : hdmi cables 
 & gt c : yeah 
 whatever 
 i need one 
 & gt me : four isles down on the left hand side 
 normally i 'm more than happy to show someone where they are but this kid back in the book section is missing his lollipop again and i see books on the floor 
 & gt c : naw they ai n't there 
 & gt me : alright let 's go have a look 
 and of course it 's fully stocked and there are multiple <unk> full of cables 
 also of note usually when someone came in to buy a cable i 'd refer them either to a discount retail store in the same plaza 
 or if they could wait i 'd tell them to order online for way less 
 this guy though ... he was paying 
 & gt me : here you go one hdmi cable 
 anything else 
 & gt c : haha naw this 'll be great for my new gaming console on my sweet new 70 inch expensive brand <unk> tv 
 & gt me : oh 
 game console 
 you do n't want that brand cable you want the one made by the manufacturer 
 plus that one comes with a spare charging cable for a second controller 
 i do n't usually upsell useless stuff either 
 it 's cheap garbage most of the time 
 upsell total : $ 20 - & gt $ 50 + $ 30 & gt c : oh sweet 
 i only have one controller though 
 & gt me : well this is a great chance to buy a second one 
 & gt c : yeah i guess it is 
 upsell total : $ 20 - & gt $ 110 + $ 90 & gt me : this way you can play multiplayer in your favorite games 
 & gt c : i do n't think i have any of them 
 & gt me : oh 
 i can highly recommend this title 
 i <unk> point to the game case for the console he owns and hope for the best 
 i ended up pointing to a popular basketball game that thankfully is multiplayer 
 he agrees to buy it 
 upsell total : $ 20 - & gt $ 170 + $ 150 & gt me : it 's multiplayer up to four you said you only have one controller right 
 if you want to make full use of this game i 'd recommend having four controllers 
 & gt c : yeah that sounds good 
 upsell total : $ 20 - & gt $ <unk> + $ <unk> & gt me : with charging cables 
 upsell total : $ 20 - & gt $ 320 + $ 300 at this point i figured he 'd have to break soon 
 i was n't even being subtle about <unk> stuff on 
 nope 
 he purchased everything and i probably could have kept going but there was now a pile of kids books and it was <unk> with a coat of <unk> i knew would never come off 
 first time posting here <unk> so i worked for a major fast food chain back in 2010 at 17 it was my first actual job and i was so innocent 
 but this is not a tale about the bad customers no those come later this is a tale of the best regular we had 
 i worked on the front cash register and about once a week this older black man would come in around lunch and patiently wait until the crowd <unk> 
 i ca n't recall exact conversations but he would always smile and ask how i was doing tell me i looked nice and just be very friendly and sweet 
 after talking he would proceed to apologize before emptying his pockets of quarters and crumpled dollar bills and order a water value fries and a value burger 
 my shift manager always gave him extra fries and something that was left behind small burger or nuggets usually whatever was going to be thrown out anyway because he was just an amazing person 
 he always left his table clean and made sure to wish everyone a blessed day 
 this man made my time there so much better and i do wonder sometimes what happened to him and wish i could have helped him more 
 edit : wow this got popular fast 
 makes me feel good that the old man is getting the <unk> 
 thank you everyone for reading so 
 i manage a 24 hour <unk> store in a <unk> of a major metropolitan city 
 i 've only posted once before though i get crazy stories everyday 
 yes every single day 
 never a <unk> moment 
 since i deal with people of all sorts it really takes a lot to shock/confuse me 
 today was one of those as i ended my overnight shift 
 we 'll call me me and we 'll call my customer bl for bus lady 
 bl : hey so last week i got a large coffee but i was about to miss my bus so i just threw a $ 5 down 
 me : yeah i remember 
 those busses suck 
 bl : haha yeah tell me about it 
 me : unperturbed thinking she was just passing time with random conversation well your total today is $ 4.87 bl : oh but i want to use my change from last week toward this 
 me : ... .. what 
 bl : i want to use my change that i did n't get because i had to make my bus 
 me : miss that was a week ago 
 bl : but you just said you remember me 
 me : internal <unk> yes i do and i 'm glad you are n't in a rush today but ... i just ca n't do that 
 bl : oh come on just this once 
 is it really a weird question 
 me : ... your total is $ 4.87 like ... really this happened last september when i worked at an office supplies store 
 for about a month and a half we had a lot of back to school sales going on and i guess that brought out the craziest of people 
 i was working my butt off in the copy center and had n't had a break in the 5 hours i 'd been there 
 i finally got to take advantage of the small <unk> in customers to run to the restroom 
 as i was heading to the back and trying my hardest to avoid the few customers that were in the store i looked up and accidentally made eye contact with a lady that had a crazed look in her eye 
 i realized my mistake and picked up my pace to the restroom as she started heading towards me 
 when i got into a stall i thought i was safe 
 i was wrong 
 i heard the restroom door open and then there was a knock on my stall door followed by the lady asking me where the <unk> were located 
 i was in shock and simply replied uh aisle six '' 
 she said thanks and left 
 in my 3 years of retail i 've never had a more weird experience than the desperate lady that really needed <unk> work for a bus company and part of my job is to fuel the gasoline powered vehicles we have we have about 17 4 minivans 3 mini <unk> 10 small special ed '' school busses 
 so for about 2 1/2 hours a day i drive to and from a local gas station to fuel up the vehicles 
 part of my routine as the gas is pumping i check the washer fluid by visually looking at the tank we have a large tank of it back at the yard 
 i have been doing this for about 3 1/2 years and every 4-6 months the following situation happens : i am at a gas station filling up a vehicle and have the hood open to check the windshield washer level 
 as i close the hood i hear someone always a woman from the next pump over ask me what i was doing with the hood open 
 checking the washer fluid '' i plainly say 
 well when you pump my gas can you check mine 
 thanks '' 
 puzzled i ask what do you mean pump your gas '' 
 she instantly gets that angry look that i know all too well driving a bus and interacting with parents of 45 kids working a year in fast food and a year in retail taught me that face you are an employee here i need help pumping my gas now please tell me why you do n't know how to do your job '' 
 this is a moment i have been waiting for the whole time i 've been in the service industry but could n't do because i need a job 
 i prepare my most neutral tone of voice possible think ben <unk> 
 lady i do n't work here 
 pump your own gas '' 
 turned around and finished the vehicle i was fueling slowly hung the nozzle got the receipt and wrote the vehicle number on it and got in the vehicle and drove off 
 i could see the lady in my side <unk> as i was leaving angrily getting out of her car to get her own gas 
 long time lurker first time poster here 
 to preface i work in a larger chain store and only recently got a position off of the front end so i 'm still trying to show i 'm a decent worker and avoid any complaints 
 so here i am in the frozen department on a friday night wishing i was anywhere else when i hear someone yelling from the ice cream isle 
 i go investigate to find a very angry lady al for now holding a <unk> or our store brand ice cream 
 now earlier this week i had gone through and got rid of any expired ice cream i could find 
 & gt al : what is your name 
 i 'm calling corporate and they 'll have your job for this 
 & gt me : firstly what seems to the the problem so i can try and fix whatever you <unk> i 've done 
 & gt al : well you 're obviously trying to kill me and everyone else in this store 
 this ice cream expired two months ago 
 at this point i was nothing but confused because i know for a fact that i had cleaned out the exact kind of ice cream she was talking about and got two new cases in & gt me : may i see the ice cream in question ma'am 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but this ice cream has yet to expire 
 it 's code date is in february <unk> 
 & gt al : if you think this gets you out of trouble you are <unk> mistaken 
 if looks could kill i think i would have been drawn and <unk> right then and there 
 i have never gotten mad at for something be fresh from the warehouse before but i guess there 's a first time for everything 
 **background : ** i work as an assistant manager at a large chicken fast-food chain while putting my way through med school 
 i can only work part-time due to my studies but the company was great about letting me keep my job since i 've been with them since high school 
 **the story : ** one of our regular customers came in and i was sad to see his wife came with him this time 
 i should note that he was a really great guy and a regular customer but we hated when his wife came with him because she was a <unk> bitch qb 
 they got their chicken without incident 
 i was training a new cashier when i heard a loud <unk> 
 i looked over and saw the standing up with both hands on the table trying and failing to breathe 
 he 'd apparently knocked over a chair 
 i run over as fast as i can only to see his wife scoffing at him wtf 
 and acting totally unconcerned 
 well i 've got an emergency medical responder license so i follow my training 
 me : sir are you choking '' 
 the guy nods back but his wife shakes her head 
 i ignore her again 
 me : i am going to perform <unk> thrusts ma'am please stand back a bit '' i move to go into position to do the thrusts which any idiot knows is the right thing to do 
 this asshole woman grabs me and yells at me not to touch him 
 qb : he 'll be fine 
 do not touch my husband '' well i could have explained why i had to touch him to her but the guy clearly was going into <unk> 
 i shoved her off of me and unfortunately she fell over a chair and landed on the ground 
 i got behind her husband and did the thrusts while she yelled all sorts of profanities from the ground 
 the chicken popped out and <unk> <unk> 
 i walked over to help her up 
 sorry ma'am but your husband needed immediate help '' 
 qb : that 's bullshit 
 he would have been fine 
 let 's get out of here honey '' 
 the husband follows her as she storms out of the store and mouths thanks 
 what the fuck 
 well all my employees give me a pat on the back and say they were glad i was here cause they do n't know anything about how to deal with that 
 i decided then and there to get employees cpr certified but that 's another story 
 the <unk> to this story is that qb filled a <unk> against me 
 she came into the store the next day 
 i had just gotten off shift and decided to do some <unk> in the back while i ate my free lunch 
 i 'm in the zone committing a particularly difficult transport path to memory when the manager comes in 
 the manager brings me out front where my old friend qb is waiting 
 manager : qb here says that you knocked her over a chair is that true 
 me : yes sir it is but her husband was choking and i did save his life so -- - qb *interrupting* : save his life 
 you 're a college dropout working in fast food 
 the fuck do you know 
 my husband would have been fine and now i 've got back pain from where i hit the chair 
 me : well ma'am my education is irrelevant but i do have a license to perform basic emergency medicine and i can tell you your husband would have certainly -- qb *interrupting* : i do n't care what you say 
 you should be fired 
 i want to file a complaint 
 me : sorry i saved your husband 's life 
 i just walked away and went back to the back room 
 i grabbed my <unk> went out to my car out the back and left the store 
 the manager called me and told me they were going to investigate 
 turns out i got to keep my job because the franchise owner is my buddy but i got a complaint in my personnel file and a warning 
 i probably should n't have shoved her but come on 
 it was the heat of the moment 
 show a little <unk> lady 
 update edit : okay so i 've talked to some people after reading the comments 
 i did n't even think about the legal action so i am grateful to you all for bringing it to my attention 
 as <unk> pointed out i definitely should not have shoved her even though it was more a reflex than anything else 
 i phoned my <unk> <unk> a trained <unk> and he said that in that <unk> he would have asked another employee to gently <unk> her 
 he reiterated scene safety but admitted that he probably would have done the same thing if he did n't have experience with stuff like this so often 
 as far as legal action is concerned i called up a third-year law student i met at a <unk> school <unk> yay top 20 law and med school 
 she mulled it over with a few other <unk> over drinks tonight and the general <unk> was that since the woman touched me first it was <unk> <unk> and that <unk> with the fact that she was interfering with legitimate medical aid by a licensed <unk> should mean i 'm almost definitely okay 
 as far as legal action against qb is concerned it 's a <unk> the law crew seems to think that she would have a defense because she was panicking and it would be hard to prove that she did n't think for some reason that i was trying to hurt her husband 
 i have n't seen her husband since the incident and some of these comments are making me a bit concerned 
 i am going to talk to a social worker tomorrow when i 'm at the hospital and see what they think i should do 
 i should also note that while it is n't extremely common sometimes relatives do deny that their loved ones are hurt at all so she is n't <unk> <unk> abusive or <unk> trying to collect life insurance 
 the fact that she came in the next day still angry is the suspicious part 
 thank you so much for the great <unk> work at a chain grocery store which is <unk> by many many old people some are amazingly nice others are complete pieces of work 
 i 'm a cashier so i deal with many people daily 
 it was the holiday season so we were selling these gourmet organic hams for $ 1.49 a pound 
 which must be hard for some people to understand i dealt with and old women who was being a complete and utter bitch to me who could n't comprehend this 
 & gt '' hi ma'am how are you did you find everything ok '' 
 i asked very politely & gt '' i 'm fine no i did n't but i do n't care anymore '' the old hag said angrily i obviously picked the wrong line '' she says under her breath she said that because i was new at the time and had just started there so i was in training i was n't the fastest cashier and my ipms were like 9 and my register even had a training in progress '' <unk> on it 
 & gt '' im sorry about that '' i say then continue scanning she 's one of those people that intently watch the screen that make sure i 'm not trying to extra charge her or something & gt '' oh wait i forgot i want paper in plastic and 2 items per bag <unk> those '' she said & gt '' oh ok no problem '' i say confused at this point i 'm kinda mad but keep my cool because i just started there so i <unk> these bags and i had already bagged a good amount of groceries so this is just getting really annoying 
 i get back to scanning and bagging and this goddamn lady is reaching in front of me across my body to take things out of the brown paper bag and move them to different bags telling me i 'm bagging everything wrong 
 two things per paper in plastic she 's <unk> the purpose of paper in plastic 
 then the ham comes up ... & gt '' why did that ham ring up and 16.89 thats a guess i cant remember the price the sign says it 's a dollar forty-nine '' the lady says angrily & gt '' what 
 the ham is $ 16.89 it rang up that way maybe you read the wrong sign '' & gt '' do n't tell me i read the wrong sign i know what i read your trying to trick me '' 
 shes getting angrier & gt '' ma'am i 'm not trying to trick you i have no idea where you got that price from this ham is $ 16.89 '' i started to get mad and raised my voice a little 
 then it dawns on me the ham is $ 1.49 a pound not in total 
 & gt '' ma'am the ham is $ 1.49 a pound not in total '' i say calmly & gt '' what 
 that 's ridiculous and <unk> thats unfair they tricked me 
 i do n't want it anymore '' she yells & gt '' ok ma'am sorry about that i just need to call someone over because its a cold <unk> '' i tell her trying to hold my temper & gt '' do n't call anyone over 
 i do n't want to make a scene this is ridiculous just leave it there '' & gt '' <unk> its a cold item it needs to go back in the cold aisle '' i say & gt '' stop making them come over here stop it i do n't wan na make a scene stop it '' the lady yells & gt '' they are already coming ma'am i hit the page '' one of the managers shows up and takes back the ham and the old lady just gives me such a nasty look and stayed silent 
 so i keep going paper in plastic two items a bag while she reaches over me moving stuff around in the bags 
 then we get to the spatula 
 it has no barcode or tags i have no idea where she got it from 
 & gt '' this has no bar code i need to call someone over to get you a new one '' & gt '' dont call anyone over i dont want a scene 
 i know the price it 's 2 dollars just put that in '' she yells & gt '' i ca n't do that without manager override someone needs to come do you still want it '' 
 & gt '' yes just do n't call anyone over '' & gt '' i have to '' i call someone over and the manger comes i tell him the issue and he comes back later to say he could n't find another one where the lady said it was and asked the people who stock the gm shelves and they had never seen this spatula before 
 the lady insists it was $ 2 and fights with my manager about it because he tells her she ca n't buy it without a price and he was n't even sure it belonged to the store 
 the lady leaves angrily and i see her goes right to customer service most likely to put in a complaint about me 
 the next guy in line was super nice and told me some customers will always be bitchy and not to take it to heart 
 the next day i found out i got a compliment from that guy to customer service for handling her well so i got a $ 5 off my lunch coupon yay 
 my manager did tell me i had a complaint from the lady i got complimented for dealing with but they did n't care 
 ah do n't you just love retail 
 edit : grammar i worked part time in retail when i was a teenager at a large <unk> chain here in the uk 
 this particular branch i worked at had 3 mains <unk> 1 set of automatic doors 1 set of push/pull doors on the other side of the till and a little further up another automatic door that lead into the pharmacy 
 usually when starting to close up we 'd keep the pharmacy doors to start to filter out customers so we could close on time 
 the other 2 sets of doors would be locked and we 'd move the large stands that hold customer baskets in front of them so people would n't go walking into them 
 this almost always worked until one fine sunday afternoon 
 it was about 10 minutes before closing and barely anyone around so i just started doing a bit of tidying around the beauty department when i noticed a woman approached the push/pull doors 
 she tried to open the door as it was locked she could n't 
 she then started aggressively <unk> with the door handle for a good minute whilst i watched until she spotted me and shouted **you gon na let me in then or what 
 you still have 10 minutes until closing i can see the time from here this is illegal ** '' 
 i approached the door and told her the second door down to the pharmacy is still open she can enter the store from there 
 she looked at me with what i can only describe as a death stare and marched off in the direction of the pharmacy 
 however this lady did not <unk> my advice 
 instead she tried her luck at a <unk> and tried to walk into the automatic doors on the opposite side of the till still locked still with huge stands placed in front of them and walked straight into the glass smacking herself square in the face 
 eventually finding her way to the pharmacy to she started screaming **i only came here for one thing but i have found you are <unk> illegal activity and i 've just been assaulted 
 ** '' to which my manager who saw everything calmly replies madam it is not illegal to lock entrances when we still keep one open it 's simply to help us close on time 
 and i do n't think you were assaulted ... '' crazy lady shouts **i dont care what the fuck its for 
 i worked in retail for 12 years i know how it fucking works 
 you need to be sacked love you have n't got a fucking clue have you 
 i 'm here for one thing and i want it now 
 ** '' <unk> and what is that '' 
 crazy lady practically throws film <unk> and my manager and says **i need these pictures developed and i need them ready for tomorrow or i <unk> be <unk> head office to tell them that you need to be fired ok 
 ** '' manager <unk> '' ohh i 'm sorry madam our photo lab is closed on sundays 
 you 'll need to come back tomorrow '' crazy lady starts to breathe heavily giving my manager that death stare she 'd given me earlier before <unk> **i want my fucking pictures if i wanted to come in on another day i fucking would 
 why cant you do your fucking job this is ridiculous 
 ** '' at this point our store security guard steps in grabs the woman by the arm and begins <unk> her out the store 
 as she 's leaving i can hear her shouting **this is assault 
 you are assaulting me 
 someone help im being assaulted by this man 
 ** '' tl dr crazy woman walks into a door then accuses said door and security guard of assaulting her 
 this may be my favorite thing that has ever happened while working and i figure this best place to share it is with you all : be me weird girl 18. i work as an overnight manager at everyone 's favorite fast food place 
 i normally work <unk> or <unk> for all you military <unk> 
 this means that not only do i get the idiot <unk> teenagers i get the early morning coffee crowd 
 between 4-6 i rarely see any new faces 
 one of my regulars let 's call him red '' comes in every morning for a coffee and a <unk> 
 super nice guy one of my favorites 
 another regular who i 'll call splenda '' is a very sweet lady who comes through every morning at about the same time 
 yesterday red asked to pay for the car behind him unusual and it happened to be splenda 
 being <unk> she was caught of guard but told me to say thank you when i saw him next 
 fast forward to this morning and splenda is in front of red 
 she asks to pay for the car behind her 
 i ca n't help but laugh and tell her that it 's the same guy who paid for her 
 they both loved the coincidence and everyone ended up with a slightly <unk> morning 
 i work in a mall restaurant and we offer a pizza pasta & amp salad buffet during lunch hours that is popular it cost about $ 14 somewhat standard price where i 'm from 
 most people buy either the buffet or their favorite meal & amp that 's that 
 then we have the kids meals sides & amp small meals 
 one of the small meals is just a slice of pizza salad & amp a drink at about $ 6 - its overpriced for one slice of pizza think <unk> of a family pizza & amp extra slices are $ 4.5 each - but you really ai n't supposed to buy multiple pieces on their own - you just get the buffet instead 
 i was still kind of new & amp this day a mother shows up with her two teenagers one of em grabs a burger with fries & amp mom & amp the other kid gets the buffet - everything is just fine 
 until dad shows up about 20 minutes later 
 since he showed up way after the rest of the family i had no clue that he belonged to that group & amp after quickly looking over the menu he told me he wanted 3 slices of pizza & amp a coke 
 i asked if he wanted salad with the slices & amp was about to continue telling him that the buffet was a better option if he wanted more than 2 slices when he just snaps at me that he wants 3 slices and a drink nothing else 
 okay fine thats $ <unk> for almost no food at all but thats what he wants 
 he pays & amp leaves with his food 
 after joining his family at the table & amp finishing his food he apparently finds out that they only payed $ 14 for an all you can eat buffet while he <unk> for his food 
 as you can guess he came back with all the receipts being even more irritated than before 
 he accused <unk> <unk> owners of scamming people out of money by making them <unk> for something they could get cheaper and i tried telling him that i would have sold him the buffet but that he demanded to get the pizza pieces only & amp that i was prepared to refund him the difference between the orders & amp he could continue to eat from the buffet until satisfied 
 this was still not to his satisfaction 
 this is when his wife joined us & amp intervened 
 she took one look at me and then turned to her husband interrupting his rant 
 <unk> when you ordered did you listen to her the first time or did you just tell her what you wanted 
 did you even read the menu properly '' 
 he proceeds to tell her that he indeed just asked for the specific slices & amp that he did not look on the menu because he wanted pizza but that it was still a scam demanding so much money & amp that i should be ashamed for going through with the order 
 at this point his wife has an annoyed look on her face & amp i brace for a double barrage of <unk> & amp complaint about the food 
 you need to stop yelling at the poor girl she did exactly what you told her to do 
 its your own fault you stupid fuck '' 
 what 
 that is the actual quote of what she said 
 i am in no doubt that both me & amp the husband looked completely <unk> 
 she proceeded to turn around & amp walk away leaving us standing there 
 her husband glanced at me & amp then just left without <unk> another word 
 i worked at a technology big-box store for several years 
 mostly in sales but i spent my time behind the returns desk eventually 
 it was n't as much fun but having all the product experience meant that i was very much aware of how the product was supposed to work 
 anyways 
 a woman comes in with a printer and receipt thankfully insisting that the printer did n't work 
 she was well within her return policy so that was n't a big problem but we did need to test it 
 after all it 's harder to sell opened merchandise and if the product did work maybe she would n't return it 
 so i start getting everything out of the box while i ask what the problem was 
 & gt '' it did n't turn on '' 
 ah 
 we 've narrowed the problem down to bad cord '' bad printer '' or doing it wrong '' 
 at least i did n't have to connect it to a computer to test its printing <unk> or hook it up to <unk> 
 by now everything 's out of the box printer on the table and i 'm <unk> around under the table to plug the cord in 
 suddenly the customer chimes in 
 & gt '' what are you doing '' 
 & gt '' i 'm looking for a place to plug it in '' 
 & gt '' why '' 
 & gt '' well it needs to be powered to turn on '' 
 & gt '' no it does n't 
 it 's wireless 
 background : i work in a small <unk> <unk> store 
 we carry a variety of high-end brands and are located near a fairly wealthy community 
 generally this means we have very little issues with bad customers but we do get some crazies occasionally 
 this tale takes place last weekend 
 as per usual the store was packed and my manager and i were working the registers to get through the line that had formed 
 cue disgruntled man with a return in manager 's line 
 & gt manager : hey how are you today 
 & gt disgruntled man : i 'd like to return this 
 throws <unk> pillow on counter & gt manager : let 's see here 
 do you have your receipt 
 & gt disgruntled man : no 
 just do the return 
 starting to get agitated at our little store we have some pretty lenient return policies for our size of store 
 it <unk> up to 60 days from purchase in new/like new condition with no damage or use and with the original packaging and a receipt 
 this is for all merchandise <unk> food and climbing equipment 
 we also can add customers into our system to keep record of their purchases if they are prone to losing receipts 
 & gt manager : remaining as calm as ever well sir i do need a receipt to process any returns 
 are you in our system 
 & gt disgruntled man : causing a scene and half shouting something about privacy government <unk> and the like 
 i was too busy the hear what it was 
 & gt disgruntled man : i 'll just take store credit 
 was never offered to him & gt manager : unfortunately i ca n't accept this back at all 
 i do n't have any record you purchasing this here the packaging is damaged and is also the wrong packaging for this pillow it smells like campfire and is covered in wood chips 
 the store is now silent 
 all eyes and ears are focused on this guy and manager 
 a pin could drop and you would n't hear it because you were too focused on these two 
 & gt disgruntled man : what wood chips 
 i do n't see any 
 flicks off the wood chips towards manager & gt manager : the wood chips you just flicked at me 
 now unless there was something wrong with the pillow that would justify a warranty claim i 'm going to have to ask you to step aside for other customers 
 & gt disgruntled man : yes 
 there is something wrong 
 the pillow is terrible 
 i groan in my mind 
 i understand that manager said that just to get him away from the registers but the <unk> are never handled by us they go straight to the manufacturer 
 this will likely piss off disgruntled man even more 
 but shockingly disgruntled man complies and fills out a warranty form and lists some nonsensical issue with the pillow 
 in true <unk> fashion disgruntled man leaves in peace and we 're stuck with a pillow and a warranty form 
 at least i do n't have to call him when the manufacturer <unk> his claim 
 that is manager 's <unk> if a customer gets upset or yells or demands their effing fries '' 
 just do what <unk> did 
 take a breath calm down and <unk> ask who told you it was ok to talk to someone like that '' 
 you 'll get a dumbfounded look without actually saying anything of <unk> 
 working in big box retail has yielded me some amazing stories 
 some involve unruly customers most involve black friday and a few result in some hilarious attempts to steal shit in the store 
 you 've all been in big box stores so i 'll describe this one 's layout 
 remember = do n't guess 
 youbanistan is not a fun place to visit ... they do n't have cookies or milk at all 
 the layout at the time was that your pcs <unk> appliances and all the big ticket items were on the outside of the main floor 
 we had a white and black <unk> that was a gigantic square which wrapped around the store and separated the big ticket stuff from the smaller items in the center 
 inside the center were cameras cell phones and most importantly shelves upon shelves of cds dvds video games etc 
 middle of the week in this store was boring as hell 
 most of us kept ourselves entertained on our earpiece radios by playing guessing games and commenting on the <unk> that came into the store and even giving a rating by referring to them as code m '' which would prompt about ten employees to start looking at the department 
 our lp guy was a good friend of mine and at <unk> '' with a hilarious sense of humor the store tended to be more fun when he was watching the cameras up front 
 on this day however we got our entertainment from a short woman who decided she was going to try and rob us blind 
 it was a little cool outside but nothing overbearing as it was early spring 
 this woman however had come in wearing extremely heavy and somewhat baggy pants a winter jacket sunglasses kept them on indoors and a heavy sweater underneath 
 it was n't a minute before she was in the dvds and already frantically looking around and just acting sketchy 
 my friend at lp we 'll call him alex hits me up on the earpiece 
 **alex : hey man can you wander over by this woman in dvds and see what the hell she is doing 
 ** **me : yeah ... why 
 is she acting strange 
 ** **alex : oh yeah 
 she did a triple take at one of the cameras i have locked on to her 
 ** **me : wow 
 why is she bundled up like it 's 20 below outside 
 ** **alex : that 's why i want you to watch her 
 ** i set up camp about three aisles <unk> from her and actually had a good view 
 sure enough this woman grabs a bunch of the cheap dvds that were n't in security cases looks around and <unk> them down her pants 
 **me : you catch that on camera 
 ** **alex : yep already calling the police now 
 just keep locked onto her 
 ** she was n't content there 
 she made a few stops along the way stopping at the xbox 360 section the blu-rays and the ps3 games 
 hey at least she was n't a <unk> of one system or the other 
 thieves apparently do n't discriminate 
 she spent the next ten minutes or so walking around to make it seem like she was just browsing 
 at this point there are four of us basically watching her from a distance while we wait for the police who showed up in the form of two cruisers outside 
 one was set up in the parking lot the other pulled up alongside the front of the building just away from the entrance 
 alex went out to greet him where the officer was outside stretching and limbering up 
 **alex : why are you stretching sir 
 ** **officer : i hope she runs 
 i need a workout 
 ** meanwhile back in the store our little thief had caught on to the fact that she was being watched the entire time and was putting the cheap dvds back in a different spot than the belonged 
 once she did that even though she still had plenty of other things she loudly announced to everyone as she made for the exit i put everything back do n't you all dare touch me you fucking pricks '' 
 <unk> 
 some people just do n't get it do they 
 of course the alarm goes off when she hits the exit and bolts right past alex as he 's coming back into the building 
 now store rules for us meant that once she was outside the store we could n't chase her 
 however officer workout was ready and sure as shit she took off the moment she saw the cruiser 
 we would find out later that the officer used to play safety for a <unk> three college nearby which was n't a shock as he performed a beautiful <unk> tackle on her in the middle of the parking lot 
 you know the type i 'm talking about : getting her from behind lifting her completely off her feet but making sure that he set her back down on the feet like you would in football warmups when <unk> tackling form 
 no injuries no blood just getting the thief 
 the best line of the day though came from the officer after he brought her back in for us to show her the security tape and to fill out our official paperwork on her 
 he heads out of the office and comes over to us giving us his direct phone number 
 **officer : seriously guys just call me next time and not <unk> 
 i love this shit 
 ** **tl dr - woman decides to steal shit from store finds out that officer was ex-football player and knows how to tackle 
 ****background : ** i work at an <unk> recognized convenience <unk> station in a small but <unk> diverse city and as such our store gets a wide variety of patrons 
 **story : ** our store is smack dab in the center of my city and as such local law enforcement love to stop by because we offer free coffee and soda whenever they need no questions asked 
 however tonight i was working on my own for a little bit while i waited for my co-worker to come relieve me 
 i saw a police cruiser pull up and thought nothing of it 
 a minute later a lady comes in from the gas pump and asked if she could use the restroom 
 i direct her to end of the store where our <unk> customer restroom is and remind her to bring the key in with her because if not then someone could walk in on her 
 a few minutes pass and then the officer from the parked police cruiser walks inside 
 i greet him as i do everyone else and he ignores me and walks straight to the back of the store where the restroom is 
 i 'll be me he 'll be **apm** or angry police man 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry sir i believe there 's a woman in there right now 
 & gt apm : no there is n't 
 if there was she 'd have taken the key with her 
 of course this bitch left the key hanging off the door 
 i usually do n't play bathroom monitor but i knew with 100 % certainty that she was still in there because she was the only person besides the officer who 'd be in the store for the past ten minutes or so 
 & gt me : no i 'm pretty sure she 's in there i just heard her flush 
 & gt apm : yeah right kid 
 so apm ignores my warning and proceeds to burst open the bathroom door 
 of course the woman is still on the toilet with her pants around her ankles and all i hear is : & gt shut the fucking door 
 yeah you really showed me how it 's done 
 maybe next time he 'll listen before he goes <unk> in.now let 's just set the mood of this tale it was our busiest time of the day we had a <unk> sized line and we were low on workers 
 it was an incredibly stressful time 
 and now let us begin 
 i work at a local ice cream store and right around 5 in the afternoon we get a slight rush 
 no the number of customers is n't <unk> but it is enough to keep you on your feet 
 so sample lady and her family walk in all excited to get their ice cream 
 they had never been to our store so the workers are encouraged to be <unk> <unk> to these customers 
 first off sample lady is not an attractive lady at all 
 she is missing half of her teeth and is not the thinnest person on the planet 
 a slight scent of fecal matter <unk> her and her shoes have massive holes in them 
 yes this has nothing to do with the story but it will help you get a mental image of how i was attempting to serve this lady 
 sample lady then proceeds to ask for a sample of a few different flavors 
 not a problem at all until she says heck i will just try them all to figure out what i want '' 
 oh goodness 
 so the process begins 
 in our store we have <unk> different flavors of ice cream out at one time and are encouraged to give as many free samples as the customer wants 
 so beginning at one end of the store and making our way towards the other more and more customers begin to file into our store 
 sample lady is still <unk> when we have over 10 customers behind her asking for my personal opinion on each flavor 
 when we finally finished our journey sample lady get this still does n't know what she wants 
 so not only did i just waste a literal half-hour serving her samples but i am having to wait on her to choose what she wants 
 by this time all of sample lady 's family has ordered and have now completely finished their ice cream 
 sample lady 's daughter approaches her mother and says hey mom we 're all done with ours ... '' realizing that she is holding up a line and her family sample 
 lady 
 leaves 
 she leaves the store 
 she does n't even order anything 
 i have yet to see sample lady <unk> i used to work as a cashier at a retail store 
 as i 'm walking around my aisle straightening up merchandise a lady and her son are waiting in line at a checkout line not mine 
 the son has on a pair of heelys shoes with small <unk> in the heels and is running up and down in front of the checkout lanes as fast as possible then rolling on his heelys 
 now the mom seemed like an incredibly soft spoken individual and was softly saying things like & lt sons name & gt please come here '' '' stop doing that '' etc etc 
 the kid was having none of it completely disregarding his mom like she was n't even there 
 i can see the mom getting irritated and finally she snaps and yells & lt sons name & gt get over here right now '' 
 kid just responds with an equally as loud no '' 
 and proceeds to take off on another <unk> 
 right across from the checkout lanes are shopping aisles and this kid decided to run a little closer to that side this time as to avoid his mom as he rode by her 
 cue a little old lady pushing her cart from behind one of those aisles 
 the kid does n't even have time to put his hands up before he smacks face first into this cart 
 it had some heavy stuff in there because this kid was moving and the cart barely moved at all as he <unk> off and landed flat on his back 
 it was something that should have been in a 3 <unk> film 
 the carts were the plastic ones with the small diamond shaped patterns and the kid came running back to mommy crying hysterically with a red <unk> of the cart on his face 
 okay here goes 
 a gentleman comes into our store last night gets a few groceries and goes to self checkout 
 as he 's there his light starts blinking so i go over 
 he is using a one day pass that allows you to shop without a membership but charges you a surcharge 
 he says he would like me to override the surcharge so he does n't have to pay it 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry sir but i ca n't do that 
 & gt guy : but i have my membership card right here 
 he pulls out his wallet and shows it to me 
 then kind of sheepishly he says & gt i just do n't want this showing up on my purchase history 
 i take a closer look at his screen 
 the only item he is purchasing is a 40 ct. box of condoms and he 's paying cash 
 oh 
 ohhh 
 none of my business 
 so professionally as you please i offer to help him 
 & gt me : well i ca n't override the surcharge but i can refund it to you after your purchase 
 will that work 
 & gt guy : yes thank you 
 that will work just fine 
 so he finishes up with the condoms and then rings his groceries through separately and then comes up to my counter to get his refund which i give him with a smile on my face and tell him to have a good night hah 
 afterwards my lp manager comes over to ask what i just did because it looked a little suspicious so i told her 
 bless her heart this little old lady burst out laughing and said something about being wild and crazy in her younger days 
 some days i really love my <unk> after i graduated highschool i worked as a page for the local library 
 i know that pushes the ragged edge of retail but we had customers and really what is a library but a book store that does n't understand <unk> 
 ***** we had some regulars in the library 
 some were kids from the highschool across the street whose parents used as a substitute daycare and others were grown-ass men who spent their entire days in a public library 
 it takes all kinds 
 this is a story about mr. meerkat the worst of our regulars 
 every day - from open to close - mr. meerkat would be there 
 he had a study booth that he always took 
 one in the back where nobody could see him 
 he earned his <unk> name from the fact that he would stand up every couple of minutes to see if anyone was approaching him 
 now i have no place judging strange people 
 it happens 
 of the 7 billion people on the planet there are gon na be some <unk> 
 mr. meerkat had a bigger problem though 
 he hid things 
 we did n't have any cameras so we were never able to prove it because everyone knew 
 he had a big problem with president <unk> fair enough and the american left in general also fair enough 
 but we would see him with say <unk> from my <unk> and a month later we would find it stuffed in a corner under a stack of magazines 
 he 'd also remove the new <unk> and hide the % local_gay_newspaper % 
 this has been going on for years 
 he 's just clever enough and county government employees are just <unk> enough that nothing has been done about it 
 enter the all seeing eye 
 i was working two jobs at the time the library and an internship at a local tech company 
 i was doing 12 hour days every day at the tech place and days i worked at the library were generally 15 - 16 hours 
 after two months of this i was an exhausted angry mess 
 i spot him sitting away from his usual space holding a copy of <unk> 
 not reading just sitting watching me 
 i know what 's coming and duck behind and aisle to watch him 
 fool thinks i ca n't see him 
 he jams the book between the stuffed chair he was in and the wall and walks off 
 my sleep deprived brain snaps and i head over grab the book he hid and tap him on the shoulder 
 <unk> : ** sir you <unk> your book '' 
 <unk> : ** no i did n't '' 
 & lt <unk> with <unk> facing ceiling & gt <unk> : ** sir do n't think i do n't know what you 've been up to 
 it makes my job harder 
 i do n't like it when you make my job harder 
 please <unk> before it becomes a problem '' 
 i lay the book in his palm and walked off without a backwards glance at my beaten <unk> 
 edit : i ca n't spell 
 edit the <unk> : wow quote of the day 
 thank you all for making my <unk> <unk> completely <unk> this happened back several months ago in the beginning months of the year 
 we were having our morning huddle when a customer walked in 
 one of our managers saw him greeted him and this follows : & gt c : i did n't realize i was late for the meeting 
 & gt m : <unk> what no coffee and doughnuts 
 & gt c : i did n't realize it was my day to bring them 
 & gt m : that 's okay we 'll forgive you this time 
 so a day or two later he comes back in to our morning huddle bringing a couple boxes of doughnuts and like a gallon of coffee from a local coffee shop 
 i know we bitch and complain about customers but this was the one instance that a customer was really awesome and made all of our <unk> 've been working in a <unk> merchandise retailer for about four years 
 mostly i work up at the customer service desk which entails printing up money orders processing wire transfers selling all the tobacco products cashing out lottery and primarily returns and exchanges 
 a year or so ago during a slower part of the day a man probably in his mid-late 50 's comes up to me at the desk with an xbox 360 to return 
 he said that he bought it a couple weeks prior which was true as he had his receipt still and i checked the date for his son who decided that he wanted a ps3 instead 
 he said that they already purchased a ps3 somewhere else and he just needed to return the xbox 
 unfortunately even with a receipt gaming consoles in addition to all computer software and hardware cds dvds video games etc are non-refundable once they 've been opened 
 i 've always thought that this policy was completely reasonable especially since my store only deals in brand new products not used 
 and we ca n't ship it back to the manufacturer unless there is some kind of manufacturer 's defect which in this case there was not 
 i calmly explained to him that once a console has been opened we can do nothing but exchange it for an identical product and that 's only in the case of a defect 
 he <unk> at me and demands a manager 
 fine awesome 
 i can see where this is going and i do n't get paid enough to deal with the brewing storm of attitude 
 so i call up the electronics manager and he comes over to talk to the customer 
 the customer explains that he does n't want the xbox anymore and wants his money back 
 in return the electronics manager disclosed our return policy basically verbatim for what i said 
 he demands a different manager this time much much louder 
 wow okay 
 so i give *my* direct manager a call and ask her to come over 
 she comes over gets the spiel from the customer about how he wants his goddamn money back and how we 're stealing from him by not giving him a refund 
 she asks the electronics manager who is still standing up here what our policy is he informs her she looks at the customer and says something like sorry this is our policy 
 if there 's anything else we can do for you please just ask hostile <unk> '' 
 the man explodes 
 yelling and screaming about how he does n't want this fucking thing and it 's ours and we have to take it back 
 there was some more screaming about how we 're dirty thieves and we 're stealing money from him and how it 's illegal 
 lots of yelling 
 i called the store director 
 the boss 's boss 's boss 
 he gets paid enough to deal with this bullshit 
 the director who is actually a completely rational cool dude comes up and after patiently listening to this guy 's ranting for about 10 minutes gives him the same answer that he 's gotten from the rest of us 
 do n't you love it when your managers back you up after you 've said no to an asshole customer 
 this is the last straw for unhappy customer guy 
 he claims that if we are n't going to do something for him he 's calling the police to arrest us all for theft 
 yep 
 theft 
 i 'm stoked to see if he does and apparently the managers are too so they tell him that he is free to call the police if he wants to 
 dude picks up his cellphone calls his lawyer or at least claims to and leaves a message detailing the situation 
 apparently his lawyer did n't have time in the middle of a work day to answer a call from one of her clients 
 he makes a second call to the 6 o'clock news 
 he wants everyone to know how shitty <unk> retailer treats their customers and screams at us about how we 'll all be out of jobs and that no one will ever shop here again 
 it 's a nationwide chain bro 
 i 'm pretty sure we 're going to be fine but thanks 
 he makes a final call to the police 
 they were the only ones to answer the fucking phone 
 hah 
 he says that the customer service bitch from retailer has stolen hundreds of dollars from him and is being backed up by all her dumbass managers 
 he 's screaming at the cops over the phone i 'm almost surprised that the police did n't hang up on him but i mean they <unk> the cops 
 i do n't think they can legally hang up on anyone who 's <unk> 911 
 it takes the cops about 30 minutes to show up during which time my managers have gone back to their jobs and i 'm filing away some paperwork and this crazy dude has plopped himself on the floor in front of my desk having some kind of sit it or something 
 every time another customer starts heading my way he yells and screams at them do n't shop here 
 they steal your money 
 bunch of fucking thieves '' 
 i 'm fine with this 
 it 's hilarious he looks like a bridge troll and i have paperwork to catch up on 
 eventually the police show up and the dude brings them over to me and has the most smug look on his face 
 it wo n't last 
 he <unk> to the nice officers that i took his money and refused to give it back which obviously puzzles them as i 'm a fucking employee and covered by like five cameras at all times 
 i clarify that i did n't take *anything* from him 
 he bought an xbox a couple weeks back opened it up and played it then wanted to return it 
 i also explained our return policy to them 
 i showed them the copy of this policy which was hanging by my desk by the desk that the xbox was <unk> at on our website and on his receipt 
 i can tell that the poor cops are just <unk> dealing with this guy but they give him an <unk> 
 he can either : *not get a refund from us and go home 
 *not get a refund and go to jail 
 angry customer : i 'd rather go to jail then let these fuckers win 
 i 'm not leaving without my money '' 
 i do n't think he was getting it 
 so the cops <unk> him and start heading towards the door when i realize that his xbox is still sitting on the counter 
 i grab it and run after them 
 me : wait sir 
 you left your merchendise at the counter '' 
 one of the cops takes it from me 
 me : have a wonderful day sir 
 thank you for shopping at retailer '' 
 i 'm pretty sure he would have strangled me if he had n't been handcuffed 
 haha 
 **tl dr : dumbass customer calls the cops on himself and it 's ever so sweet 
 <unk> r/talesfromretail i 'm a longtime lurker who thought it 's about time i shared with you some of my * '' delightful '' * experiences with customers i have had working for one of the uk 's biggest <unk> companies 
 having worked there for quite some time now i am pretty much a vet and if there 's two things the job has taught me it 's that : * 1 if you 're not speaking to people face to face they will show you just how <unk> they can be * and 2 that some people 's entitlement knows no <unk> 
 i work by a simple <unk> : - *i work in customer service i provide customers with a service i am not a customer servant 
 * anyway onto the tale 
 i am sitting at my desk browsing r/talesfromretail when i glance at my countdown timer <unk> i lift my headset and sign into my phone as the countdown reaches zero 
 i smile to trick myself into thinking i 'm going to be able to <unk> a <unk> of happiness until the end of my shift my final break is already a <unk> memory and now i face the slog through until <unk> when she <unk> through 
 let 's call her entitled bitch or eb for short 
 & gt me : hello you 're through to- & gt eb : shut up and listen 
 & gt me : excuse me 
 & gt eb : i said listen 
 & gt me : i 'm all ears miss 
 & gt eb : good 
 *you* are going to explain to me where my technician is <unk> 
 **you** <unk> 
 a technician is one of our guys in the field he goes and repairs equipment etc 
 & gt me : i do ... & gt eb : ... & gt me : can i firstly get your account details for the purposes of data protection 
 i just need your name and password 
 & gt eb : audible sigh i ca n't remember my password 
 & gt me : can you remember your name 
 & gt eb : of course 
 & gt me : can i have that to start with 
 & gt eb : entitled bitch 
 & gt me : okay eb i 'm going to ask some security <unk> & gt eb : look i do n't have time <unk> & gt me : look i understand you are frustrated but i have to complete security because you have n't quoted the password if i do n't do it i 'll lose my job 
 & gt eb : i do n't care about your job i want <unk> & gt me : i 'll stop you there you might not care but i certainly do now we can move this along a lot quicker if you just go along with the process 
 i can hear the <unk> rage in her voice she 's not used to being spoken to so directly i sit proudly like the walls of jericho and she has no <unk> to break me down 
 she <unk> <unk> with my request 
 & gt me : okay now that we 've cleared <unk> let me have a look and see what 's going on here 
 & gt eb : ... & gt me : okay so you booked a technician on the <unk> 
 & gt eb : yes my tv service is broken my downstairs set top box is showing an extremely poor quality of picture and this is <unk> unacceptable 
 ** i booked a tech to come out with one of your idiot <unk> and i specifically asked for a **morning slot 
 ** but the idiot booked me in for an afternoon slot so *i* had to take time out of **my** day to call back to your automated service yesterday and reshedule it for today 
 & gt me : okay so i can see you did indeed call back in yesterday and reshedule your appointment for a morning <unk> & gt eb : and you kept sending me these stupid fucking text alerts saying your appointment is scheduled for today throughout all of yesterday but with the <unk> time so i had to cancel them **so where the fuck is the man who 's coming to fix my tv 
 ** & gt me : okay eb i 'm going to have to ask you not to shout down the phone at me i 'm well aware you 're frustrated but screaming in my ear is n't going to solve anything so please calm down and let me have a look and see what 's going on the line will go quiet but i 'll be back asap 
 i put her on silent hold where in i can hear her but she ca n't hear me i chuckle as she calls me some very colourful names 
 i check the notes on her account and realize what 's happened and for the first time all day i smile a real smile a smug smile and realise what i 'm about to say is going to make me very happy right up until the end of my shift 
 & gt me : hi et 
 & gt eb : what 
 & gt me : do you know this number 
 <unk> 
 & gt eb : yes of course it 's mine 
 & gt me : does anyone else have access to your phone 
 & gt eb : are you an idiot 
 of course not 
 & gt me : okay it 's just you mentioned that you called our automated service and booked in a morning appointment for today 
 & gt eb : yes i did 
 & gt me : did you recieve a confirmation text when you done that 
 & gt eb : ... & gt me : are you still the- & gt eb : no i did not 
 & gt me : really it 's just i can see we sent one out to your number the one i just read to you and it seems as though you 've sent us a reply back to cancel your appointment from your phone 
 stunned silence i can practically hear the gears in her head come to a grinding halt as they try to figure out who is to blame for this <unk> 
 & gt eb : what are you saying 
 & gt me : well it looks as if you 've cancelled your own appointment by mistake 
 & gt eb : well what are you going to do about it 
 & gt me : well the best i can do really is book another appointment & gt eb : when for 
 & gt me : that 'll be in two days time 
 & gt eb : that 's not good enough i 've been waiting for days 
 & gt me : i know but there 's other appointments booked in the closest slot i have is in two days time 
 & gt eb : this is really really **really fucking <unk> customer service and you know something you have n't even apologised to me for any of this 
 & gt me : excuse me 
 & gt eb : you 
 i demand an apology for this i want money off my bill i wan- & gt me : wait a minute eb 
 i have to stop you there this is n't my fault and it 's not <unk> company 's fault 
 this is your fault why on earth should i apologise to you for your mistake 
 & gt eb : ... & gt me : your appointment is in two days that 's the best i can do for you 
 will that be all 
 & gt eb : yes 
 & gt me : <unk> and she was gone hopefully to <unk> like the <unk> child she is whilst cursing me for <unk> to talk back whilst i grinned satisfied for the rest of my shift 
 *i work in customer service i provide customers with a service i am not a customer servant 
 * edit : some formatting changed et to eb 
 edit 2 : wow thanks for all the love guys & amp quote of the day 
 i may have found <unk> new home & lt <unk> this just happened 
 english is my second language and in my language we never say please '' madam '' sir '' or anything formal like that so that rubs off on my english if anyone think i was rude to the lady 
 i work in a place that among other things has a lot of tourists 
 this particular lady had been at my desk earlier with some questions 
 a few hours later she came back 
 her : so i have this other question that is not about workplace 
 this is common seeing as we have many tourists asking general questions about the city restaurants etc 
 me : sure i 'll do my best to help you 
 her : i do n't have my credit card and i need to buy this thing online so if you could use your card i could give you cash 
 me : <unk> excuse me 
 her : says the same thing again me : i 'm sorry but i 'm not comfortable doing that 
 her : but why 
 i 'll give you cash 
 at this point i 'm not sure how to explain it further without offending her me : i 'm sorry i 'm just not comfortable using my own private credit card like this her : well that 's very rude 
 i just need some help i do n't understand why when i can give you cash 
 me : i 'm very sorry but i 'm just not comfortable with it plus it 'd be against company policy if i ordered things online from work 
 i could get fired 
 i have no idea if that 's true but it <unk> could be she gave me an angry look and left without a word 
 edit : turned out to be an overall strange day 
 there was a guy sat in our <unk> blasting the pokémon theme from his laptop on repeat for 30 minutes <unk> someone asked him to stop 
 edit 2 : was the danish version of the pokémon <unk> there tfr i 'm a longtime lurker and i did n't really have anything worthwhile to post until now 
 also it should be noted that i do n't technically work in retail but i do work in customer service ... i do n't know if that <unk> me from posting but i hope not 
 anyway a little background i work at the headquarters of a particular state 's police force and i am the guy in charge of fingerprinting all civilians 
 on average i fingerprint about 45 people a day most of these encounters are short sweet and forgettable this one time however was not 
 at about 10:00 am a larger woman in a red dress comes in and immediately takes a seat 
 which granted is odd as they usually come up to me or go up to a nearby window to ask <unk> if they need to check in or whatever however it does happen 
 i finish fingerprinting the person i am on and politely ask the woman if she is there to be fingerprinted or if she 's looking for another office 
 people get lost here it 's a big building she tells me she is not being fingerprinted and asks if it 's okay to just park a seat for a while 
 sure whatever it does n't bother me any 
 i continue fingerprinting people 
 at approximately <unk> a young woman of mexican descent comes in 
 usually i would n't mention the ethnicity but i feel it 's important in this instance as this woman hardly speaks a lick of english 
 it 's fine i <unk> which fingers i need and we get her fingerprinted rather quickly 
 she then thanks me and goes to the window to ask for information about something else 
 not sure what i had other customers to deal with about 11:30 rolls around and she goes to the window a second time and this time i hear her ask about an escort 
 now this is odd as no one asks for an escort 
 the woman behind the window offers to get her manager and walks away 
 at which point the woman comes to me and asks me if i could escort her because she 's afraid 
 now i have to explain that i am not the kind of guy you 'd immediately go to for an escort 
 1. i 'm not an actual officer i 'm just a clerk essentially 
 2. i 'm wearing a sweater vest 
 3. i 'm a tall guy but quite <unk> and could n't hold my own if push came to shove 
 4. i 'm not supposed to leave my post except for scheduled breaks i try to explain this to the woman but she is n't really getting much of it 
 i try to get her to wait until an actual police officer shows up to help her but she refuses saying frantically that she has to leave now because that woman is watching her '' 
 now this is the first mention of <unk> she needed an escort so i attempt to pry more information out of her 
 she explains in broken english that the large woman in red has been watching her the whole time giving her devil 's eyes '' and whispering things under her breath and she 's scared she might be attacked 
 i look over to see if the woman in red is doing such things but she 's gone and the woman before me frantically explains that she 's waiting out in the hallway trying to catch her as she leaves and attack her 
 i do n't believe her but i pretend i do 
 i try to calm her down and check my watch seeing that it 's been quite a few minutes and no police officer has shown up yet 
 i have customers waiting 
 finally i break down and agree to escort her out of the building 
 i quickly apologize to my waiting customers and then i walk out with the woman 
 the hallway is as i expected completely clear of the woman in red 
 as we hastily walk towards the elevators her out of fear me out of the need to get people fingerprinted the woman in red steps out of a bathroom door in front of us blocking us off 
 the scared woman <unk> behind me hoping that my thin body will protect her 
 it wo n't but i stand firm 
 the red woman <unk> and i do not use this <unk> <unk> she legitimately sounded like she was trying to pull of her best <unk> impression i know what you are '' 
 i point to myself me '' 
 no not you '' she spits once again i use this literally as some spittle flew in an <unk> from her mouth 
 that *thing* behind you '' 
 the woman behind me lets out a little <unk> of terror 
 the red woman continues do you have any idea what that *thing* is 
 that *creature* you 're protecting '' 
 i 've worked retail before so i know how to calm people down or at least that 's what i tell myself so i said ma'am i do know who she is she 's a very scared young woman and i 'm taking her to the front door '' 
 no '' the red woman shouts 
 she 's a demon 
 an ally of the <unk> '' 
 this causes me to blink 
 now i 've dealt with some crazies in my time both at retail and when i worked at a pool which is another story in and of itself but i had never *never* experienced something like this and quite frankly i did n't know how to handle the situation 
 the young woman behind me was pulling on my sweater vest and begging me to move 
 i too desperately wanted to move but in order to get to the elevators or the stairs we 'd have to shove past the red woman 
 instead i tried to calm the woman down ma'am i do n't know who you think this woman is- '' who '' 
 she shrieked cutting me off 
 it is not a <unk> but a <unk> and what it is is a demon 
 a creature like her ruined my family and i wo n't let her do something like that to another family '' 
 the woman behind me shrieked again for me to move 
 and this time i did realizing that there was absolutely no dealing with the red woman 
 i began walking quickly with my long legs i can cover ground very quickly and with the woman now in tears clinging onto me i pushed past the woman in red and going towards the elevators and the stairs 
 do you know what kind of evil you are aiding '' 
 the red woman <unk> as i rushed by 
 do you not know that by aiding it you are also <unk> in its evil ways 
 i know it looks like a <unk> woman to you but it 's not that 's how it <unk> you '' 
 i ignored her and made for the stairs knowing that the elevator would n't be ready in time 
 i knocked open the large metal door and together the crying woman and i rushed down the stairs me taking them two at a time her clinging to me for dear life 
 above us the woman in red began shouting down at us what sounded like a prayer ripped straight from *the <unk> or one of its many <unk> full of a great deal of <unk> '' 
 and i banish <unk> '' 
 i ignored them as best i could and rushed down the five floors of stairs and into the main lobby 
 in the lobby are several uniformed officers at all times to run security and help <unk> find their way around and so forth 
 i rushed over to one of these officers and explained the situation as best i could because the poor woman behind me was a terrified <unk> mess and could n't communicate her feelings to save her life 
 i could tell that part of him did n't believe a word of it and frankly i did n't believe much of it myself 
 of course he did believe when the red woman stepped out of the elevators and made a <unk> towards us the crying woman shrieking at the sight of her 
 the red woman her eyes narrowed and her cheeks red from <unk> began to start in on another prayer screaming at the top of her lungs in the middle of the lobby at this poor woman 
 the officer immediately called for backup as he tried to <unk> the situation 
 desperately trying to do what i had done and make the woman in red calm down 
 instead it seemed he only began to make her angrier as her <unk> became louder and more desperate 
 a crowd was beginning to form 
 stunned faces surrounded us as a two more officers appeared and began to separate the woman 
 two ended up dragging the red woman away to calm her down and get her side of the story 
 the original officer questioned me again and tried to get the poor crying woman to calm down however it did n't work 
 eventually the red woman was escorted out of the building one officer on either side of her 
 on the way out she just glared at the poor little woman who continued to hide behind me until a few minutes later another officer appeared and escorted her to her car 
 the original officer then turned to me and asked what the hell was that '' 
 i do n't know officer i do n't know 
 bewildered i returned to my desk only to discover that i had 10 customers waiting to be fingerprinted all of them were agitated at me for making them wait so long 
 i had to work through my lunch break to get caught up 
 <unk> i wish i could tell you what happened after the fact but the truth is i do n't know 
 i have n't seen either of the women for over a week and i have only bumped into the officer once since and just laughed and gave a small head shake when he saw me 
 upon coming home after work that day i told the story to all of my friends and only one believed me and that 's only because he had worked for the state and as he put it dude some really weird shit goes on in state offices '' 
 i have to agree with <unk> do n't work at this store but i thought you guys might like this story anyway 
 i was in line the other night at a certain popular overpriced grocery in the nicer area of town behind a very pretty middle aged asian lady and as she was checking out the guy in front of her a slightly balding redhead wearing a very nice suit was standing at the bagging area trying to convince her to have drinks with him that night 
 he was complimenting her looks asking if she was single and such 
 she seemed a little embarrassed but eventually smiled and agreed the cashier was all excited and encouraging her on as well 
 after i was finished checking out i walked to my car and they were putting their groceries into the same car and chatting very obviously husband and wife at that point 
 at first i had thought he was being a little forward and bugging her a bit but seeing that it was her husband playing at picking up his dream girl at the grocery it was really really sweet 
 browsing tfr has made me remember all sorts of stories i never got around to posting 
 this happened mid-november 
 i was cashiering as always at grocery store 
 a very cute little kid was sitting in the main basket of his adult 's cart <unk> her groceries for her 
 i 'm just taking things as they come down and packing them up mostly tuning out the interaction between the boy and the woman with him 
 finally i 'm waiting on the last item as he 's trying to fish it out of the cart 
 he drops it on the belt : one single bulb of garlic in a plastic bag 
 it comes down the belt toward me and he says the single cutest thing i 've ever heard a small child say much to the delight of the other customers in line and the cashier in the register behind me 
 small child : <unk> to the <unk> bye baby pumpkin 
 this marks one of the very few times a child was more cute than a complete nuisance in my store 
 i do have a few other cute kid <unk> i could share <unk> at work one day when a rather irate looking woman comes up to me and starts explaining that her daughter bought one of our products only yesterday er no we were closed yesterday and proceeds to show me a photo on her phone of a broken product that her daughter dropped 
 i checked stock and we had no more the woman became more irate and said that she was not happy because the product was faulty and fell and broke just a minute earlier it had been dropped now it had fell 
 there was a few seconds silence when the woman said ok can i have a refund then i said do you have the product with you 
 she said no my daughter has it 
 i said well i cant do anything without the product back the lady mumbled something and went off in a huff 
 so there some idiot wanted to return an item they did n't have 
 **i work in a grocery store in the south in the customer service department 
 this guy came up to cash a <unk> dang 60 bucks to uncle sam in taxes '' said the customer 
 that is n't too bad man '' i replied cheerfully trying to make conversation could be worse '' 
 it is when you have that on top of child support 
 thanks again to uncle sam '' 
 at this point i just smiled and nodded 
 i fought the urge to tell him it was n't uncle sam that got his girlfriend <unk> i was talking to a co worker and found out that we both used to frequent the same 24 hour diner 
 he shared this story with me and i thought i 'd share with you 
 so my friend and his friends went to this diner and were sat next to a very large woman probably about five foot nothing and around 300 pounds and her very skinny boyfriend 
 also shes really drunk 
 so big fat drunk lady bfdl demands that her boyfriend give her a dollar she wants to play the claw machine 
 she walks over to the claw machine and drops the dollar 
 when she <unk> over to pick it up her too small sweat shorts <unk> into her butt 
 my 
 friend described it as the largest <unk> most <unk> marked and cellulite ridden cottage cheese ass you have ever seen '' 
 so that is pretty gross 
 after trying and failing the claw machine bfdl <unk> around the corner for a few minutes 
 she comes back just as her food gets to the table but along with the waitress two cops walked up to the table 
 the cops say ma'am some of the other patrons said that they saw you take four dollars from a table that they left as a tip '' 
 bfdl immediately starts yelling and cursing at the officers oh hell no 
 thats bullshit '' 
 she pulls some neatly folded twenties in a money clip from one pocket as shes screaming 
 she pulls from the other pocket four <unk> ones 
 this hear is my money i found it '' she yells as shes trying to smooth out the money 
 then she realizes what she said and changes her story no i brought these from home 
 this is my money '' 
 finally the officers have had enough and they say that shes going to have to come with them 
 bfdl screams no picks up her plate of food and smashes it against the wall 
 at this point she goes under the table and comes back up eating a piece of food that hit the floor 
 the officers lead her out in cuffs at this point as shes screaming and spraying food <unk> everywhere 
 the super skinny boyfriend who has not said a single word at this point looks at his food lets out a long deep sigh and says man 
 she has the keys '' tl dr she had the keys 
 <unk> i ca n't <unk> bit of background on me : i work for one of the major supermarket/grocery chains in australia as a service supervisor in the service department 
 this basically means as most of you would know i work on the registers and at the service desk and deal with transactions complaints <unk> and pretty much anything else that could possibly happen ... i 've been working in the service department for around 6 years and have been a supervisor for around 2 years 
 -- -- -- this one day i was managing self-checkouts dealing with <unk> answering questions etc and was currently chatting to a lady going through one of the sco machines cause it was quiet ... one of the machines next to her broke after a customer had used it and unfortunately due to what broke was not able to be fixed at a store level we had to put in a call to support for it so i closed it ... now i decided to be a bit silly ... because why not and it was quiet ... i got the closed signs from most the other sco machines closed the broken machine so it displayed closed '' on the screen and put about 6 close signs all over the damn thing 
 there was a sign on the tray where you put your basket a sign on the scales a sign in front of the receipt printer a sign in the bagging area a sign on top of the screen a sign on top of the eftpos machine and the machine itself had its screen showing closed '' 
 that should be obvious enough right 
 <unk> 
 the lady i had been speaking to looked at me like i was mad and said do you have enough closed signs there '' 
 i simply replied eh i 'm bored and i want to see if people read signs 
 i bet you that someone will come and ask me if this machine is open before i finish my shift '' 
 she simply replied with hah no one would be that stupid '' 
 famous last words 
 : p not 30 seconds later some random lady came over and this happened & gt random : is this one available 
 -gestures to the closed machine- & gt me : no sorry it 's closed 
 -gestures to the several closed <unk> & gt me : one of the machines over there are free though 
 <unk> at some open <unk> & gt random : oh ok. thanks 
 -wanders off to an open machine- i turn around after this to see the lady that i had been speaking to looking completely speechless and in shock 
 she simply said did that really happen '' 
 my response 
 & gt yup 
 welcome to <unk> a gas station clerk most of my customers understand that gas price changes are <unk> by forces far outside my control 
 yes i physically change the price in the computer and on the sign outside but i do n't have any say in the how and when 
 when the price is going up we change the sign before we change it on the pumps 
 when the price is going down we do the opposite 
 this way during the short amount of time when the sign and pumps display different prices the sign is always higher 
 this way people who see the sign from the road are never paying more than they expect to 
 it 's important to do it this way so that people ca n't accuse us of false advertising 
 in theory 
 here 's what happened 
 all the gas stations around us were going up by like 40¢ and we were due to raise our prices along with them 
 because we were among the last to change we were <unk> with people trying to fill up their cars before the price hike 
 finally it 's time to raise our prices 
 i grab the numbers for the sign and go outside for the walk of shame 
 same routine as always 
 i do n't make eye contact with anyone 
 certainly there are customers glad to see they *just* made it in time but i do n't necessarily trust some of my elderly customers to have a full grasp of the situation 
 they just see a guy raising the gas price 
 i 'm trying to use body language to convey i only work here '' 
 i change the sign walk back in and change the price on the pumps via the computer 
 i think the moment of <unk> <unk> is over 
 nope 
 within seconds an old woman throws open the door 
 & gt old lady : did you just raise the gas price '' 
 & gt me : yes '' 
 & gt old lady : that 's false advertising 
 your sign says $ x.xx '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but the sign says $ x.xx 
 i changed it before i changed it on the pumps '' 
 & gt old lady : your sign said $ x.xx 
 that 's why i drove here '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry 
 you must 've just missed it 
 we change the sign first so that people do n't pay more than they think they 're going to '' 
 & gt old woman : but you changed it right as i was fueling 
 the sign said $ x.xx when i pulled in '' 
 & gt me : did you begin fueling before the price change 
 if you did you get the lower price 
 it does n't go up in the middle of a transaction '' 
 & gt old lady : i- i mean no 
 but i was here 
 you ca n't change the price on me before i start filling up '' 
 so she was just slow 
 unfortunately there really is no <unk> 
 i ca n't do anything about the situation 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry '' 
 she stammers a bit turns and walks out 
 this happened a few months ago and i still joke about it with my coworkers 
 hey i was able to raise the price without getting yelled at by any old ladies '' 
 tl dr : title says it allso ... i 'm a manager at a charity shop 
 today i decided to take the till at our other location for a few hours just me in the shop no other staff 
 they have their own staff and i have never worked that shop before 
 guy comes in and wants a thing 
 i tell him the thing will be 50p 
 guy : oh i get free things i work at the other shop 
 me : <unk> i 'm a manager at the other shop and know you do n't work there 
 guy : *face <unk> uh ... i used to work there ... me : i 've been there a year and have never seen you there 
 guy : i know jenny ... who are you 
 me : no jenny works at either of our shops 
 and you 'd know my name if you worked for us 
 he got a bit <unk> after that trying to get into the staff only area saying over and over that he did n't have the money was i going to make him walk the streets asking for 50p trying to claim i was n't the manager and 'just the shop girl and then the tried and tested <unk> of just standing at the till staring at me 
 i told him off for challenging my authority - 'i do n't care if you do n't believe that i am the manager you do n't work here - eventually told him to either pay up or get out and do n't come back he finally produced the damn 50p 
 definitely not his lucky day 
 i had been working fast food for about three years when i finally landed a <unk> job at a chocolate store 
 i 've dealt with some <unk> customers so i 'm very good at being patient 
 but this i just have no idea 
 we sold chocolate covered strawberries in the store 
 they sold out pretty fast despite being sold at a 250 % <unk> 
 one afternoon when i 'm there alone a girl about 15 and her mother come up to the counter 
 & gt mother : samples & gt me : excuse me 
 & gt mother : where are your samples 
 now this is a pet peeve of mine when people just come in grab free chocolate and walk right back out especially because they generally grab <unk> for their family '' and <unk> are expensive 
 my manager told me to hide them and only offer them to customers who are looking around or buying something 
 the daughter is looking at the fruit case so i ask her if she needs any help 
 & gt daughter : how much are the strawberries 
 & gt me : five dollars each & gt daughter : ok i 'll have one 
 i grab one for her wrap it up and take it to the register 
 i 'm checking the code list and punching it in when she sticks her hand over the register with a five dollar bill 
 she starts waving it until i take it 
 & gt me : okay that 'll be $ <unk> & gt daughter : you said five dollars & gt me : well yeah but there 's tax & gt daughter : no i do n't pay tax i 'm not entirely sure if she 's joking at this point 
 her mother comes over and asks why she 's taking so long 
 & gt daughter : she says there 's tax & gt mother : tax 
 we do n't pay tax 
 you said five dollars so we 're paying five dollars 
 & gt me : everything has tax & gt mother : no it does n't i do n't pay tax now we have secret shoppers that come around so i 'm doing my best to be polite in case they 're trying to prank me 
 i laugh 
 & gt me : well i 'm sorry i ca n't waive tax you can take that up with the government 
 the mother narrows her eyes and huffs loudly 
 & gt mother : then we 'll go somewhere that they wo n't charge us taxes 
 i stood there in complete confusion as they left the store raving about how they have not and will not ever pay tax on things they buy 
 edit : a lot of people are bringing up first <unk> status cards 
 this would have made sense if they showed one or mentioned one or even like threw it at me in a fit of rage 
 i can unfortunately not read minds yet.background : i work at a videogame store we buy and sell used games 
 you can also <unk> games at our store 
 we have a regular customer who pretty much always <unk> the newest games and sells his old ones so he can pay for the new ones 
 normal stuff 
 but a few days ago he had a weird idea 
 he pre-ordered a game and wanted to pick it up 
 as usual i asked him if he wants to sell some game so he can get the new one for a lower price and he pulls something out 
 he puts the very same videogame sealed on the counter and i am super confused 
 me is obviously me he will be re regular : & gt re : i want to sell this game so i can get my ordered game cheaper 
 & gt me : but ... this is the very same game 
 & gt re : oh yeah it was a gift 
 but i do n't want this one i want the one i ordered here 
 & gt me : but this is literally the same game there are no differences 
 there are also no bonuses if you pre-ordered or anything 
 & gt re : yeah that 's fine 
 & gt *sigh* & gt me : okay so we would give you around 30€ german guy here so you would have to pay another 30€ to get your version 
 & gt re : alright 
 *takes out his wallet* & gt me : excuse me but are you sure you want to do this 
 i mean you could also give me 30€ now and take the very same game home that you are selling me because it is literally the same version 
 i appreciate that you want to have business with us but there is no reason for you to do this 
 & gt re : so i would just waste my money 
 & gt me : *sigh* yes 
 & gt re : wow i did n't realize 
 thanks 
 he then left the store 
 i am still confused about this 
 in just what way did he think this would be a good thing for him 
 yo 
 retail guy for 10 months here 
 i work at a chain grocery store with a huge focus on customer satisfaction and <unk> 
 i was a cashier for 8 months grew insane from it and regained my sanity by moving to produce 
 regained it until last night 
 a little preface : about a week ago i bought a nice blue birdbath from my store during my lunch to give to my mom for mother 's day 
 since i still live with her i did n't want her to see it 
 so i asked my sm if i could hide it in her office and pick it up later 
 she thought it was a nice gift and said ok. so i tapped a receipt to it with my name written on it and stuffed it there 
 fast forward to last night 
 it 's the end of my shift and i decide to take the birdbath to my car to bring home 
 as i load the thing up in a cart and haul it towards the doors a customer comes up to me and asks how much it was 
 i tell them and they ask if we had anymore left 
 i knew we did n't i bought it early for a reason told him so and he insisted i check 
 i ask one of my nearby coworkers to look since i 'm off the clock 
 in hindsight i should 've left there but i like helping customers so no biggie 
 coworker returns surprise surprise none left 
 we apologize and he mumbles out an ok. as we are about to to leave the customer asks if he can buy mine 
 i think he is joking chuckle tell him i already bought it awhile ago 
 apparently that was n't the answer he wanted 
 instantly he starts yelling at me saying that i 'm just some highschool dropout <unk> lol what 
 and that either i give him the birdbath or he will complain to the store manager for refusing to service him 
 at first i was confused and taken aback but then i just looked at him 
 started laughing 
 i told him to go do that pointed in a random direction and said she is over there 
 he turns around and stomps off 
 my coworker just looks at me and says you know she went home an hour ago right '' 
 i reply with the best shitting eating grin <unk> 
 good luck with that fuckwit '' we share a laugh and i leave 
 **edit** : ok just got off work a bit ago and was with friends 
 i talked to my coworker who said fifteen minutes after i left the guy just kinda stomped out of there 
 did n't see him today or anything 
 sorry to <unk> 
 i have another tfr to share if you 'd like instead 
 briefly before my husband started working freight he was a train <unk> for several years 
 because of that he was very familiar with the laws and statutes that applied to the railway 
 ok. so my husband was a supervisor at the train <unk> where freight was unloaded/loaded for a major shipping company 
 despite being a supervisor he was very hands on 
 they were understaffed and his two best workers were a <unk> and an albino who always had to take breaks to get out of the sun 
 one day he gets called over because somehow a customer had gotten the phone number for the dock 
 to this day he has no clue how they got it 
 it was an older gentleman who was impatiently waiting for delivery on a very large package 
 my husband was polite checked the tracking and verified that it would be unloaded in a few hours picked up sent to the warehouse loaded into a delivery truck and he would have it first thing tomorrow 
 the man was not happy 
 my husband verified his <unk> delivery date was the following day but this man wanted to drive down to the train dock to pick it up himself 
 this violated about a million company rules and several railway laws 
 my husband explained that <unk> were strictly <unk> on the property they did n't have the proper equipment to load the package into a private vehicle etc 
 the man went from not happy to pissed really quickly 
 after yelling at my husband for several minutes my husband simply hung up 
 he 's not a people person '' and customer interaction was far from his job duties 
 before he left the phone rang again so he picked up and the pissed customer informed him that his grandson was coming to pick up the item and he 'd like to see my husband stop him because he was a cop 
 again my husband hung up 
 about <unk> later a squad car pulled up 
 security had let him thru because who wants to <unk> a cop off 
 he approached my husband asked if he was the man who kept hanging up on his grandfather and my husband replied yes 
 that was me 
 i do n't know how your grandfather got the number here but we do n't do customer service here and it 's impossible for him to get his item right now 
 if he wants to call the warehouse and make arrangements to pick it up once it 's there he 's welcome to 
 like grandfather like grandson cop was po 'd 
 he starts telling my husband he will '' be handing over the item blah blah blah 
 again my husband explained how it violated company policy and having a <unk> employee on the property was also a no-no for safety reasons 
 the cop was n't having any of it and began demanding to know exactly where the package was 
 my husband explained it was in a freight car waiting to be unloaded with the other largest items of the shipment 
 at this point the cop began demanding to be taken to the freight car 
 my husband had enough officer this is private property 
 your presence here without just cause or a warrant is ridiculous and you could risk the safety of my crew 
 this train needs to be out of here by a certain time because we have other trains coming in today and frankly you 're stalling the whole process just by being here '' 
 the cop was quick to retort you have my <unk> property 
 you 're not handing it over 
 id say that possession of stolen property is just cause to be here 
 knowing company rules my husband replied when your grandfather had his item shipped thru our company he automatically agreed to our rules 
 this process is one of them 
 and you ca n't steal something from someone who has yet to take possession of it 
 he cop threatened berated etc 
 my husband saw that most of his guys had stopped/slowed working to watch the show and they really did have another train on its way so my husband needed to clear this up fast and get back to work 
 he told the cop ok ok. i 'll take you too it 
 the cop smugly followed as my husband escorted him to the freight car 
 now i 'm not sure what this man had shipped but according to my husband the package was not only huge but very heavy 
 so you just gon na throw this in your squad car the package was a little less then half the size of a car 
 the cop looked confused for a second and said i 'm leaving to get my neighbors flat bed 
 when i get back you 're gon na help me load it 
 my husband shook his head we do n't have the equipment for that and anyone here who helps will be fired 
 besides this <unk> in theft since we 're responsible for the item until it 's signed for '' 
 the cop retorted you will help or i 'll make sure everyone here has to stop work while i run some checks on them 
 looking at his watch my husband said alright 
 how long 
 the cop told him about an hour 
 after the cop left the crew quickly finished unloading the cars and loading all the packages onto the trucks bound for the delivery warehouse and just as the cop in the flat bed returned the train was taking off into the wild blue yonder 
 during the time the cop was gone my husband contacted corporate briefed them and they provided him with info to pass on to the officer 
 once he 'd been told the package was on its way to the warehouse the cop flipped 
 just as he began threatening my husband and his crew with all sorts of bullshit my husband handed him a piece of paper 
 what the hell is this 
 my husbanded responded that is the phone number to our corporate headquarters 
 they and their attorneys want a call from you immediately 
 we have security footage of you trespassing into company property and later i will be writing a statement in regards to how you tried to order me to break laws pertaining to the railway system 
 your actions here could have caused a train <unk> due to demanding we stall our trains 
 i 'd make that call quickly because our attorneys are already calling the chief of police to ask why one of his on duty officers would be here demanding <unk> acts threatening people and trespassing '' 
 the crew applauded and the cop had a mini <unk> 
 he screamed threatened and made <unk> gestures to which my husband silently pointed to a security can pointed their way 
 that 's on tape now too officer 
 i 'd get to making that call before i 'm forced to have your truck towed for being on private property 
 the cop internally admitted defeat and left 
 the next day my husband got a call from the chief of police apologizing for his officers actions and kindly asked that my husband not push corporate to follow thru on a lawsuit and charges 
 my husband obliged under the terms that no officer was to come onto the property again unless they were called or had a warrant he feared retaliation on himself and his crew 
 the chief gave my husband his cell phone number and told him if any officer showed up without just cause to call him right away 
 justice served : one of my coworkers is a very friendly older lady upwards of 65 who is so sweet and loves to chat with both employees and customers 
 she can be a little <unk> but most everybody loves her because she 's so nice 
 anyway i recently had this conversation with her about the upcoming holiday season : her : do you think i need to request to work on black friday or do you think i 'll just get scheduled because everyone else wants it off 
 me : you want to work on black friday 
 her : yeah i love working on black friday 
 but i did n't get to last year 
 me : i guess it is kind of exciting huh 
 her : oh i just love watching the stupid fucks run around like chickens trying to save $ 3 
 and then she just kind of <unk> my shoulder and left the breakroom <unk> her head <unk> 
 its your friendly neighborhood <unk> worker back again 
 today i had a guy think <unk> 20 's come in and order a sandwich 
 then in the middle of putting on the <unk> he decides to call someone on the phone and talk for a few minutes while my co-worker politely waits for him to finish because whenever she asks what he wants he ignores her 
 strike one 
 then when he finally gets to the register he asks me how much cookies are 
 i respond and tell him they are 50 cents each or 3 for $ 1.30 
 he asks me can you give me 3 for $ 1.00 since i bought a sandwich '' 
 strike two 
 no sir 
 that 's not how it works 
 our prices are concrete so it 's three for $ 1.30 
 if you want three cookies with your sandwich that 's what you 'll pay '' 
 then as i ring him up he asks if i have any change to use out of my own pocket so he does n't have to break his $ 10.00 bill 
 strike three 
 you 're out 
 i was trying so hard to be polite too 
 but this guy took the cake 
 do not do any of these things at a store ever 
 you can not haggle with retail workers 
 do n't <unk> have worked at a pet store for almost a decade and a half 
 pet stores are special really special because they tend to attract a <unk> amount of really <unk> people as in the type who love animals because most other people ca n't stand that person <unk> that the animals would actually like or interact with them either if they were n't a <unk> audience 
 i head up the fish room and take many of the <unk> phone calls while i 'm working 
 this lady called me up and was concerned because her fish was <unk> what she thought was some odd behavior 
 the conversation was as follows : me : what exactly is your fish doing '' 
 lady : well he kind of goes like this ... '' me : he goes like what '' 
 lady : like this ... '' me : i do n't understand you 'll have to give me details '' 
 lady : are n't you paying attention he goes like this ... '' 
 me : either the phone line is cutting out every time you try to describe it or i am <unk> going deaf in one ear whenever you start '' 
 lady getting flustered : i 'm trying to show you ... '' 
 me : are you gesturing or using body language '' 
 lady : yes '' 
 me : ma'am you are talking to me over a telephone line 
 i ca n't see what you are doing '' 
 lady : * click * one of the many instances where working retail has <unk> <unk> my view of and hope for our species 
 i do n't know if she was on something or what 
 i have a hard time believing that any sane rational person could possibly believe that i could see what they are doing over a standard touch-tone <unk> 8 yo girl came into my bookstore today and asked me where the <unk> <unk> books were so she could get her judy <unk> on and we got to talking about school 
 she said one of her classes is learning how to speak chinese 
 impressed i asked if she could count to ten and she looked at me like do n't be ridiculous everyone can count to ten in <unk> '' and then <unk> rattled off the numbers 
 i asked her how to say a few more words and she knew each one 
 it was impressive to say the least 
 her dad was off to the side lit up like a <unk> and obviously incredibly proud of his awesome daughter 
 so then this rando customer who was listening in piped up to say that 's an important language to learn these days 
 for business '' 
 um okay 
 then in a slow condescending <unk> to children voice : <unk> '' 
 yup 
 she gets a blank stare from the girl and after a beat goes on to say oh that 's advanced you probably have n't learned it yet '' 
 the girl exchanges looks with her dad and replies oh i guess not '' 
 after the lady leaves the girl whispers to her dad i think that lady believes chinese and japanese are the same language '' 
 this little hero was too goddamn polite to say anything to rando lady 
 knows chinese and diplomacy 
 she 's got my <unk> 
 i only wish i had the <unk> to have simply said <unk> is japanese we were talking about her chinese class '' 
 little hero could have kept her moment in the sun and i do n't think i 'd lose any sleep if it embarrassed the customer ... sorry little <unk> story i saw on here reminded me of my own story 
 i used to work at a red big box store 
 one day a lady came through my line with argan oil 
 at the time it was a really expensive product 
 i rang it up with all of her other items and she stopped me to ask for a discount 
 i looked at it and there was nothing wrong with the package at all 
 she said she wanted a discount because there was a rubber band on the box 
 i almost face <unk> and politely told her that a rubber band on a perfectly good package was not a reason to get a discount 
 she got angry and smashed the box herself 
 she then very smugly said there now it 's damaged 
 what is my discount '' 
 i took the oil and removed it from the transaction 
 i told her that it was too damaged to be purchased 
 she looked at me like i had grown a second head and paid for the rest of her stuff 
 as she was leaving the lady behind her asked if she could purchase the oil as it had been the last one 
 of course i sold it to her at a discount 
 sorry for any formatting or spelling/grammar errors english is n't my first languagefor those that do n't know there is an ongoing helium shortage that 's lasted a couple of years 
 helium is sold to stores last -- it 's sold to <unk> and the government primarily 
 i worked in the <unk> department of a local grocery store for my first job a few years ago 
 the particular story below happened pretty frequently actually and it still knocks the wind out of me when i think about it 
 around this time all of the stores in the area were out of helium for a 3 or 4 month stretch 
 & gt cc confused customer : hi can i get 20 balloons 
 & gt me : i can still get you balloons but i do n't have any helium right now 
 & gt cc : ca n't you just use air 
 & gt me : i can but it wo n't float 
 & gt cc : why not ... 
 *looks at me like i 'm <unk> & gt me : well ... we do n't have any helium 
 & gt cc : what is helium 
 & gt me : um ... it 's the stuff that makes the balloon float 
 & gt cc : why wo n't it float with air 
 & gt me : the balloon is too heavy ... helium is light so it makes the balloon float 
 & gt cc : that is ridiculous 
 yes 
 yes it is <unk> was working my usual shift at an office supply store when a guy came up to my register to check some things out 
 so after ringing every item through his total came to about $ 9 
 he proceeded to give me a $ 5 coupon 
 ok so your total comes to $ 4 '' 
 the customer looked at me as if what i had just said was the most absolutely ridiculous thing he had ever heard 
 no it 's not 
 it ca n't be 
 <unk> is 13 '' 
 you 're right 
 and <unk> is 4 '' 
 still very confused he handed me $ 4 and left 
 sometimes i just do n't know 
 edit : just to be clear he was a nice guy i just thought it was an amusing conversation we had 
 in fact he was one of the nicer customers that day and i did n't mean to make him sound ignorant or idiotic 
 seems like a few people thought it came across that way and it was by no means my intention.i was returning some clothes in the women 's section when a lady came up to me slightly out of breath and flustered 
 do you have <unk> '' she asked pointing to the design displayed on a box of tights 
 i checked the rails and found another box like that 
 she shook her head evidently frustrated 
 no 
 do you have <unk> '' she pointed at the tights again 
 they had a <unk> design at the <unk> meant to <unk> garters 
 ah garters '' 
 she nodded 
 i do n't think we do garters i 'm afraid '' i told her which is of course <unk> for *we definitely do n't have <unk> 
 so you do n't do them or you do 
 do you think or do you <unk> '' 
 she was obviously pissed and in a hurry so i did the obvious thing and offered to ask a manager 
 she swore quietly probably not at me as we walked before turning to me and saying he gives me an hour and tells me to dress like a whore 
 what does he expect '' 
 i kept my mouth shut and nodded sympathetically 
 turns out we do n't sell garters 
 i informed her her best bet was a nearby lingerie store and she hurried away checking her watch 
 the other day i had a customer who picked up three of a fairly cheap item - 80p each or 3 for £2 which works out at a 40p discount 
 i rung them up and said that 'll be £2 please '' 
 lady : £2 
 that 's not right 
 they 're 3 for 2 are n't they 
 <unk> '' 
 me : no they 're three for two pounds '' 
 lady : it says right here 
 three for two '' 
 she points to the label by the item her finger is directly below the <unk> sign 
 me : that says three for two <unk> '' 
 lady : oh well that 's not as cheap as i want them '' 
 me : do you still want them or shall i cancel the transaction '' 
 lady : no '' 
 that 's not a helpful answer i 'm thinking - is it no to the first part or the second part 
 then she walks out 
 there 's my answer 
 and all that over a 40p difference 
 a few hours later a man came in and picked up two of the same item 
 i told him they were three for two pounds 
 he brightened up commented that it was a good deal and picked up a <unk> the other day about half an hour before opening i was facing up some of the shelves near the checkout area at the front of the store when a man came up to me asking when we 'd open our front doors 
 bemused i managed to point out that we were closed before he walked off cheerily mentioning that he 'd head back the way he came - through our back door that was definitely locked shut 
 neither the colleague who was with me or i could work out how he 'd got <unk> 'm a cashier at a grocery chain that breeds special snowflake behavior in our customers 
 weeks ago a couple came through my lane and spent roughly 200 dollars worth of groceries 
 apparently the man left with the building before the transaction was complete 
 the woman swiped 2 cards both of them declined twice a piece 
 i got very nervous because i just had this job for barely a month and as i said her man left with the groceries 
 i politely ask if she had another card 
 she told me she did n't 
 at that point i asked if her husband was coming back with the groceries 
 she <unk> the question 
 i excused myself to get the manager because at this point my line was getting backed up and i just did not know what to do 
 the manager <unk> her entire order and puts her aside to speak with her 
 my next day of work i was scolded by my manager for not showing this woman compassion '' and not apologizing that her card did n't work '' 
 little did my manager know that i have had dozens of customers who cards have declined during the transaction and in all of those times they paid up with cash after 2 declined swipes at most and they were not with someone who left our store with unpaid for merch ... in those situations i *did* say i 'm sorry but your card has been declined '' but in this situation i was too concerned about losing my job or not getting my next paycheck behind this with that said i was not rude to this woman nor visibly irritated with her i never found out if they ever paid or not and i do not even care at this point 
 **this the second part of an extremely long/involved story 
 its recommended you do n't skim read or skip seconds 
 ** **all of it is 100 % <unk> ** the chinese wedding { epic worst day } part 1 lets recap shall we 
 * i was late for work and missed and earlier run because i slept through my alarm * boss yelled and screamed at me and nearly caused me to be late again 
 * was in fact late again for initial wedding pick up <unk> * traffic was a nightmare to dropoff * had an unscheduled pick up which i 'm apparently held responsible for * wedding coordinator sneakywc ties this freaking family heirloom bow across my limo * the bow wire <unk> the power cable because of the <unk> * <unk> my life dodging traffic to get a damn bow * i get yelled at by a very pissed off father of the bride ... twice 
 * sneakywc had just threatened to sue my company and is possibly calling my boss right now 
 * and i 'm **10 out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale 2:30pm - to say my day is not going good is a hilarious understatement 
 with the wedding taking place and i 've got a couple of hours to kill the hood is popped and i start to do some surgery to the limo 
 i 'm no <unk> but i am handy and tech <unk> 
 the <unk> each vehicle has just the basics and i carry a <unk> multi-tool with me 
 i <unk> away at both sides of the <unk> cable and expose both sides of the fine mesh of wire closer to the one on the right 
 i then <unk> the two ends together and use a crap ton of electrical tape to make sure it holds for the next few hour 
 i test it out and it works ... for now 
 i make a <unk> to a fellow limo driver i 'm friends with and rant to him about my day 
 he is extremely sympathetic and ends up giving me a lot of advice on how to handle this father of the bride and sneakywc 
 it turns out he was familiar with this run and was present when the boss was taking down the information 
 sneakywc and fotb had tried to pull a fast one on me 
 the extra pickup of the bride n company i just made was not allowed 
 it would have cost fotb extra because of the time and gas required to get them 
 not only that the boss <unk> told <unk> that she is **not** to tie this bow on the limo 
 upon further review of the runsheet sure enough the crossed out ~~chinese bow~~ was in fact the bosses attempt at <unk> it and inadvertently crossed out the <unk> directly above it 
 i completely missed it before because i had only glanced at it previously 
 <unk> ... with new found confidence i am calm yet determined to see this run through 
 i now know that i can just take the bow off and argue with the father/family because it was the wedding coordinator who pulled the fast one 
 but its the bride and groom who are the real victims here 
 i 'll let it stay on for the remainder of the trip because i 'm just going to <unk> for the final drop-off 
 **6 out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale i clean out the limo and make it picture perfect 
 i <unk> <unk> the outside to a shine and even <unk> the ribbons of the bow so that it will last the final leg of the journey 
 i <unk> down the front wires to the grill so that is this sucker is not coming off important later 
 i notice that the fibers of the arms are <unk> and very old 
 the wind and excessive flapping has worn this thing raw getting run over a few times has n't helped either 
 <unk> - the wedding has long been over but pictures at the church have taken extra time 
 i 'm to drop them off at <unk> at the restaurant 
 with late afternoon traffic ... this is cutting it short as i do n't want to charge them extra 
 drivers clock out from a run by immediately filling the car up with gas at the nearest station once a run is over 
 if the receipt timestamp is 45mins later than the run is supposed to end the boss will start asking questions or assume we pocketed the extra money 
 bride and groom are smiling obviously in a better mood and the events from earlier that day have been tossed aside 
 i settle them in and smoothly pull out of the parking lot 
 i 'm happy they are happy the birds are happy the sun is <unk> my limo is working and this <unk> run is about to be over 
 we are all good right ... 
 ohh how wrong i was 
 <unk> - while on surface streets attempting to head to the 10 freeway i 'm noticing that the arms of the bow are looking worse for wear 
 the excessive wind is literally pulling the fibers apart near the hood 
 this catches the attention of the bride and groom and they slide up the bench seats to peer out the front window from the back 
 bride is worried because the bow is a 75 year old heirloom from her grandmother but accepts its pretty much destroyed 
 the limo is cruising fast and the right arm of the ribbon tears free near the windshield and is flapping <unk> in the wind 
 <unk> ... that ca n't be <unk> 
 the three of us are practically holding our breath as we notice the left ribbon tears free close to the same spot moments later 
 * uhhh <unk> <unk> 
 thats not good 
 i 'm going to ... uhh slow down and take care of this ok '' 
 with no <unk> from the newlyweds i carefully slow the limo down and make preparations to pull over 
 you know how movies can sometimes slow down a scene and play it in <unk> slow motion 
 well i can still see the memories of what happened next replay in perfect high def slow motion 
 when you have two silk pieces of cloth land on a <unk> smooth surface like a hood there is very little surface <unk> 
 <unk> that with an incline and <unk> will take hold 
 the two arms land <unk> on the white surface and start sliding forward to the front of the car 
 lincoln towncars have a large fan in the front of the car 
 large circulating fans in a hot car means you have a vacuum effect going on 
 silk does n't weight much 
 the two long ribbons get sucked up under the limousine and **whhirl** - <unk> - <unk> 
 ** the limo just stops as we lurch forward 
 dead 
 nothing ... * whaaaaat the ... what the hell 
 i slam the hazard lights on again for the second time that day and step outside to inspect the damage 
 the ribbons of this @ # $ % bow are <unk> tight like <unk> strings up and under the bumper of the car 
 *you have got to be kidding me 
 * come on 
 i go back to the drivers <unk> and pop the hood ... only it does n't pop 
 wtf 
 i go to look at it and the @ # $ % # ing bow is still attached to the grill 
 lincoln towncars have the grill attached to the hood of the car rather than the frame of the vehicle 
 when you lift the hood the grill comes with it 
 i ca n't lift the hood because the bow is tied down with wires through the grill and the ribbons are locked up tight underneath the car 
 i 'm screwed 
 **10 out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale i quickly explain to the bride and groom that everything is under control ... like hell it was 
 and to please remain in the vehicle while i handle this 
 with my suit and tie still on trusty limo repair kit on hand i crawl on the dirty asphalt to inspect the damage 
 after a few minutes <unk> the situation i determine that the only way i 'm going to free the silk ribbons from the <unk> fan is to literally cut the damn thing and attempt to unwind it 
 i use the knife from utility pliers and start cutting this 75 year old family heirloom that has lasted through <unk> 
 <unk> - i 'm burned dirty sweaty and have road scum all over me ... i feel like a <unk> rowe should be <unk> me right now 
 <unk> out of 10** on the pissed off '' scale i 've managed to get the ribbons unwound but they are shredded and an <unk> greasy mess from what they once were 
 the bow is still locked in place on the grill but at least the fan is spinning freely when i turned it 
 i <unk> throw the heap of frayed ribbons into the trunk and grumble my way to the drivers seat 
 i start the car it works 
 and bride and groom are in a heated phone conversation in chinese 
 probably the family 
 they are wondering where they are 
 6:15 - i pull up to the restaurant to my final drop off ... but that 's not the end of the story 
 hell hath no fury like a father of the bride scorn 
 **end of part 2** ** the chinese wedding { epic worst day } part 3 *edited a few things for <unk> <unk> friend of mine told me this story last night and i thought it was awesome enough to share 
 my friend was working in a hardware store in college which meant she had to deal with contractors a lot and she said contractors were always pretty rude 
 she had one in one day and she asked for his account number which is a series of numbers and letters 
 he mumbled it to her and she could n't understand him so she asked again 
 he mumbled again 
 she was getting slightly embarrassed and asked a third time because she could n't understand what he was saying 
 he finally tells her number in a loud voice he was visibly annoyed and goes you know i know a great place that sells hearing aids down the street '' 
 she smiles pulls her hair away from her ears and responds with thats ok 
 i already have two '' 
 my friend is deaf 
 the man went completely white and did n't say another word 
 everyone she worked with was dying of laughter 
 he never came back 
 when i was a little kid and my parents bought me an ice cream i stood <unk> of the freezer as we watched the ice-cream person scoop the ice-cream and put it on the cone 
 <unk> scooping go on keep going i thought to myself 
 and then he/she would stop and hand you a <unk> scoop and leave you slightly <unk> 
 you could have kept rolling the ball and you know it '' you think again 
 fast forward 10 years and i 'm working in a cafe with an ice-cream freezer 
 my boss put me on there yesterday and i took it upon myself to make as many kid 's days as possible 
 you could see the look on there face as you kept scooping past the point where they thought you 'd stop and have a huge ear to ear grin on their face when you pass it over the counter to them 
 it made my day a whole lot nicer when a dad walked over with his two kids who must 've been about 10 and 12. the kids were incredibly polite using all their ps and <unk> and being generally nice unlike some brats we get 
 as they walked off ice-cream in hand i said to their dad those two were easily the two nicest polite kids i 've served all summer '' 
 he told me that meant alot and seemed genuinely happy with himself as he walked off to join the rest of family 
 that was a good <unk> awhile after college i worked as a security guard through a <unk> agency 
 it was pretty easy work and you have to have a year of security experience before any of the big companies will consider <unk> you full time 
 one time i was called out to be a guard at a street fair where one street was closed off and filled with two rows of vendors 
 my job was simple : stand near a <unk> that blocked off the street and not let anyone drive through 
 at first i thought this was rather silly since the street was <unk> with a a large black and yellow crossbeam 
 and yet ... suv drives up and parks directly in front of the crossbeam 
 the driver stares at it for about 30 seconds the entire time i 'm standing in front of it and staring back at him 
 driver exits the vehicle literally walks around me and starts to move the crossbeam 
 * me : sir the street is closed 
 you ca n't go through here '' 
 * drive pointing to donut shop on other side of the street : but i want to go get donuts '' 
 * me : sir there is a parking lot to your left please park there and walk across or drive around the fair to the other side '' 
 * driver : i 'll be real quick i promise '' 
 * me : sir the street is filled with people 
 you ca n't go through here '' 
 * drive : they 'll move i 'll go slow '' 
 eventually i convinced the driver to park in the parking lot and walk the 300 feet to the <unk> store 
 i <unk> that one up to just a <unk> caffeine <unk> and laugh it off 
 just as he 's driving off another vehicle drives up 
 this one starts honking the horn at me and pointing at the barrier 
 i walk over to the driver side window 
 * me : can i help you sir '' 
 * driver : move the damn thing 
 i 'm going through '' 
 * me the street is closed to traffic 
 you can go around '' 
 * driver : long string of threats and <unk> 
 i casually walk over to the barricade and sit down on it watching the driver yell and <unk> his horn at me 
 he eventually starts gunning his engine in a car where gunning the engine is not intimidating 
 he eventually throws it into <unk> and screeches off flipping me the bird on the way out 
 the rest of the day is uneventful up until near the end when the fair is starting to close down as the fair is open '' until 6pm as best i can remember 
 someone drives up to the barricade at <unk> and sits there staring at me 
 * me : can i help you ma'am '' 
 * driver : they 're not allowed to be here past six 
 move the thing '' 
 * me : ma'am the barricade will remain in place until the city removes it '' 
 * driver : the fair is over at six so i am driving through here at six 
 if i hit something it 's your fault '' 
 * me : i understand ma'am let me get on the radio to sort this out '' 
 i click on my radio and stand behind a large <unk> <unk> and speak in a <unk> voice to ensure she hears me : we 've got a color make and model sedan at the streets intersection driver says that she plans to drive through the fair in five minutes even if people are still there 
 requesting assistance 
 license plate number driver is a description '' 
 at this point the driver starts screaming at me from her window he 's lying 
 he 's lying '' 
 over and over about a dozen times with increasing scream in her voice 
 as a police officer starts approaching the barricade from the fair side she actually tries to make a run for it 
 she tries to make a sharp turn to turn around clips a light pole and a bench on the sidewalk and <unk> towards the next intersection 
 the police officer gets on his radio and calls it in and i hear sirens in the distance 
 they did n't need my statement since the officer saw the person do the hit and run 
 i did n't volunteer for <unk> after <unk> in college i worked a part time job at a hardware store 
 i came back for a second degree so at the time i was a little older than the average associate there 24 yo 
 i had been working there for about a year and we get a lot of the same people in and out contractors <unk> <unk> and had even grew up in the smallish town so i know a lot of these regulars 
 on occasion i would even go to peoples <unk> after hours to help them install <unk> wire sockets and a bunch of little odds and ends that some people dont know how to do 
 i promise this is relevant later 
 so one day im out in the yard moving some mulch pallets with the forklift really hard to see around a pallet of mulch when its up on the <unk> and this guy driving a convertible blue corvette pulls into the side of the lot thats clearly reserved for <unk> the mulch 
 he pulls up pretty fast <unk> avoiding me 
 happens a lot i guess some people just done know how to drive around people operating <unk> 
 anyways he pulls into this parking spot right next to our propane fill up station smoking a cigar 
 immediately i get off the lift and tell him he needs to put the cigar out 
 he sort of laughs and gives me that ok whatever '' look and proceeds to set the lit cigar on the concrete pad that our 1500 gallon propane storage tank <unk> on 
 i tell him he needs to put it out now or im going to put it out for him 
 he tells me that if i touch his ******* cigar i 'll have words with your manager and <unk> be fired '' 
 and proceeds to casually stroll into the store 
 one of the regular contractor guys that ive helped out a lot in the past and we know each other on a first name basis sees this whole thing happen and walks over toward me and says you should put that out on that ******* leather seats '' 
 we have a laugh about it as im stomping out the cigar still cant believe he left a lit cigar next to a propane fill station contractor guy tells me he 'll wait with me and explain it all to my manager when he inevitably comes out 
 s sure enough about 2 minutes later corvette guy comes out with my manager already in tow 
 corvette guy is already pointing at me and yelling and my manager who im on really good terms with and im sure will have my back regardless has the this will be good '' look on his face 
 before corvette guy can really even get over to me the contractor walked very aggressively up to this guy with the smashed up cigar in his hand and throws it in his face yelling about how big of an idiot he is and if he doesnt leave right now hes going to crush his car with his <unk> points to it on the back of his trailer and send him to the hospital in an ambulance 
 i didnt know what to say and my manager looks from me to the contractor to corvette guy and without missing a beat goes uhh yeah sir dont ever come back here again 
 next time you want to complain about someones behavior and try to have them fired for saving your life just remember that i know a guy with a bulldozer that will <unk> you up '' 
 corvette guy sheepishly drove away never to be seen again 
 i know that you all are painfully aware that customers are apparently <unk> of reading signs but i just need to rant for a second 
 the store at which i cashier has card readers that have the microchip option 
 however the chip reader does n't actually work so the customer has to slide their card instead 
 the prompt screen on the card reader says please slide your card '' with an animation showing a card being slid on the side of the machine 
 some people do n't get that though and have still tried to shove their card in the chip reader 
 after i explain that it does n't work and they have to slide their card they get all huffy 
 so i put a piece of packing tape over where they would put the microchip and also colored over that with black marker in hopes that people would get the hint that the chip reader does n't work 
 nope 
 one guy actually tore the tape off exclaiming why the hell is there tape on here '' 
 i <unk> my urge to scream and explained to him that the chip reader does n't work 
 he blamed me the cashier for it 
 okay 
 yesterday after 12 customers in a row tried to use the chip reader i hung up a little sign reading chip reader <unk> not** work 
 please slide your card 
 thank you 
 : '' over where one would put their card in the event that the chip reader actually worked 
 this morning a lady ripped the little sign off and tried to put her card in but i had replaced the ripped off tape so it did n't work 
 she looked at me with a look of utter confusion and asked why her card would n't go in 
 i just stared back picked up the sign she tore off stuck it back on the machine and pointed to it 
 of course that made her angry because how dare i <unk> her intelligence like that 
 i 'm out of options for getting people to stop trying to use the chip reader 
 i 'm going crazy.one of my ushers calls me over and says that there is someone wandering around looking for a manager 
 i meet them at the concession stand 
 it 's a woman about mid-late 20s and her husband around the same age 
 immediately she puts on her best i 've been <unk> '' face and launches into this story : i was here yesterday watching 1:30 *the lazarus <unk> and your concession worker gave my husband coke instead of diet coke and he had a diabetic attack and we had to leave so he could get a shot 
 i called and talked to someone on the phone who said that we could have free tickets and concession '' 
 immediately i am suspicious of her story 
 i had been there the previous day and did not remember <unk> or her husband 
 not only that but the usher she had asked for the manager was the person who was working concession the previous day 
 they did n't appear to recognize him or else they would have mentioned that he was the one who served the incorrect drink 
 do you have you ticket <unk> or receipt '' 
 i asked them which is the first thing i always ask someone who claims they had a problem '' the previous day 
 no 
 the person on the phone never told me i needed them 
 they just said to talk to the manager '' 
 she said indignantly 
 ok. who did you talk to '' 
 i do n't remember '' uhh well when did you call '' 
 i do n't remember '' 
 so at this point i am severely <unk> her story 
 i tell her to hold on and walk into the small office off the concession stand to look at our attendance from the previous day 
 i pull up the showtime attendance for lazarus effect ... and low and behold the show time she claims she was there for had 0 tickets sold to it 
 a huge grin <unk> across my face as i print the report realizing i had caught her in a lie and was about to shove it right in her face 
 i walk back over to her with the report in my hand 
 so here 's the thing 
 i looked at the attendance for the previous day and there were no tickets sold to lazarus effect '' 
 her face freezes 
 here i 'll show you '' 
 i slapped down the report on the counter and pulled a pen triumphantly from my hair 
 here 's the lazarus effect '' 
 i pointed to the name on the report here 's the showtime you claimed you went to '' i circled 1:30 and here 's the amount of tickets sold '' 
 i circled the number <unk> 
 well ... <unk> ... .this is ridiculous your box office person sold us the wrong tickets then '' 
 she said in a last-ditch effort 
 no 
 if they sold you the wrong tickets you would have been in the wrong theatre 
 you would n't have been in lazarus effect at all '' 
 well -- well -- this is ridiculous -- your theatre -- i guess i 'll just buy my tickets '' 
 she said and grabbed her husband who was silent the entire time and <unk> off 
 she ended up just leaving out of the front doors and did n't come back 
 that 's right bitch 
 if you think i 'm not going to fact check your story you are dead wrong 
 long time lurker first post ... blah blah i 've worked in retail for 5 years now and ... yea i 've got me some stories 
 most of these take place at an east coast <unk> chain with a goose as it 's <unk> 
 very popular 
 <unk> ... **i want <unk> i 've only just started at this job when our soda machine decides to no longer produces ice 
 <unk> let 's just slap a sign up and give ice out the deli 
 most people were fine with this and if we gave too much ... dumped it out 
 one lady comes up & gt ice bottom of the cup '' not a problem 
 i scoop some ice and hand it back 
 & gt '' too much '' she hands it back and i empty some 
 she leaves and comes back 5 minutes later 
 she 's <unk> her cup like a club and shrieking 
 & gt '' i asked for ice on the bottom of the cup '' 
 i look over and sure enough the ice is floating 
 & gt '' but ma'am ice <unk> ... '' well that 's no excuse for not doing your job '' she storms out and i look <unk> time post so be gentle 
 also i am not entirely sure that this belongs here but i thought this was the most interesting phone call at my last job 
 setup : i live in a small city i the midwest and i worked for a company that served adults with disabilities in a group home setting 
 i am working at the main house the first house the owner opened and also the location of the office 
 the number to the house also <unk> as the main line to the business 
 i would answer the phone when working since i would never have any idea if a manager or the owner was downstairs working and they did not like to get interrupted anyway 
 so i am working one afternoon and this guy calls in and says something like : you have someone working for you who is on drugs and i thought you would like to know this '' 
 since the company is so small i have met every single employee 
 so i bite 
 me : who are you talking about '' 
 he names an employee that we do n't have 
 i 'm a bit at a loss so i tell him thanks for calling but we do n't actually have that person as an employee 
 he insists that she is working there says her name repeatedly and very slowly as if that will help 
 i again tell him this person is absolutely not an employee and add that i have personally met each employee and have never heard of this woman 
 i remember there is another organization in town that works with individuals with disabilities 
 the first two words of my company 's name is the same as their 's and the third word is similar 
 i suggest to him that he has confused our companies and he should call them 
 him : you do n't care if your employees are on drugs '' 
 me : sir we would care if that was our employee but since that person does n't work here it really does n't concern us '' 
 i am staring to get a bit frustrated 
 him : i want to speak with your supervisor 
 now '' 
 me : they are very busy and do n't have time for this 
 this person is not our employee so i am not going to bother them with this 
 him : where is your office 
 i will come down there and tell them myself 
 since the office is actually a group home as well i really do n't want this guy coming here 
 besides the address to the company is listed along with the phone number 
 so i lie 
 me : the location is confidential i 'm sorry i ca n't tell you 
 the guy really loses it starts screaming about how he knows that we have that <unk> person employed and how he is going to come straight down to the office which he can now apparently find and tell to my supervisors everything and get both myself and this other person fired 
 i tell him that i will see him soon then and hang up 
 no one ever shows up 
 fast forward a six years and this other company in town with the similar name has now hired me 
 i am chatting with my supervisor about my new company and how they seem to be very accommodating and understanding 
 she agrees and mentions that she dated a guy who turned out to be very unstable and he came into the office screaming about how she was on drugs and made up other lies to get her fired etc and the boss saw through that 
 how they had to have his picture posted at reception and they called the police if he showed up 
 then it dawns on me my supervisor is the employee on drugs '' from that call years <unk> yeah this little thing happened a few minutes ago 
 so my coworker is helping a guy out 
 he 's trying to return some parts that look like he ran them over with his car 
 we wo n't return his money but he tells him we will give him store credit 
 he does n't like this and begins yelling 
 i see its time for my lunch so i clock out and head to my car 
 well apparently this guy did n't like that i was leaving and begins yelling at me 
 i 'm on my lunch so i do n't listen to him and just walk out 
 he follows me still yelling and all i tell him is i 'm sorry but i 'm on my lunch and wo n't be able to help him 
 as i 'm turning around he runs and jumps on my back 
 now out of reaction i <unk> my shoulder down and this causes him to flip over my shoulder and land on his back in front of me 
 i can see this knocked the air out of him so i asked if he was okay 
 he nods that yes he 's okay 
 and i calmly tell him i wo n't call the police but he not allowed to return to the store and i will call the cops on him should he return for trespassing 
 i leave and go enjoy my lunch 
 tl dr : <unk> know me like that 
 this is my boss story not mine yesterday i was on my half sitting in the back <unk> on some almond joy pieces and playing games on my phone 
 i had 5 minutes left of my break and i hear our sensor go off 
 now our sensor is pretty close to some of our merchandise and it 's not uncommon for people carrying items around the store to set it off or an employee <unk> to set it off 
 but i heard it and i just **knew** 
 someone was stealing and my boss was going to have a field day 
 as she told it to me some kid and his mom were in the store looking around and decided to leave 
 the set the sensor off and the guy mid to late teens kept walking 
 mom stops 
 mom : you get your ass back in that store 
 why did you beep 
 guy slowly <unk> back in store setting off the sensor again 
 he had a couple bags from other stores like <unk> american eagle <unk> etc 
 filled with shit from those stores 
 my boss gives the kid the standard speech of maybe someone else left a sensor on i can try to remove it for you blah blah blah '' that we give anyone with other store 's bags who set off the sensor bar 
 mom : we sure as hell did n't beep on the way in 
 *turns to <unk> you better not be fucking stealing 
 guy is silent 
 and still as fucking stone 
 mom : give her your fucking bags to go through 
 guy slowly handed his bags to my boss who sees one of our 3 dollar novelty item with a big ass ink sensor on it right on top of some shorts from some other store 
 boss lady : oh that must have just fallen in there 
 it 's not a big deal 
 she was really just trying to be nice because she knew this mom was not fucking around 
 mom : i 'm not stupid 
 i know what he did 
 to her kid what the fuck is wrong with you 
 stealing shit from a store when i take you out to buy you clothes 
 for three fucking dollars 
 are you an idiot 
 mom then dragged her son out of the door yelling and screaming about bringing all his things back and returning them <unk> him etc 
 my boss bursts through the back door and starts off the story with that kid 's gon na get his ass beat when he gets home '' 
 i work at a <unk> store that prints photos 
 this story does n't have much to do with me but i 'm so glad i was there to see it 
 a woman came in with her two kids -- a daughter who was around 2 and a son who was about 4. her son was dressed up in a police officer halloween costume 
 i sold the mother her photos and then she and the kids walked around the rest of the store 
 the store is actually right around the corner from the local police station 
 in the most perfect beautiful coincidence i 've ever been witness to the kid in the police officer costume ended up back in line with an actual real life police officer 
 the kid was obviously excited but i 'd say his reaction was mostly sheer <unk> 
 they took a picture together and the cop crouched down and did a thumbs up and the kid looked over and made a thumbs up too 
 the cop was really great and talked with him for a while i know he was little but i 've never seen a kid pay better attention to anything and i have a feeling he 'll never forget any of this 
 finally he asked the kid if he wanted to see the inside of his police car of course he did 
 the mom thanked the cop -- who definitely was enjoying himself too -- on the way out 
 he said this is the important part of my job '' 
 the whole thing was so precious i almost cried 
 short time lurker first time poster 
 i used to work at theme park as a body artist 
 to give a little more detail i worked as a face painter 
 i paint faces and do temporary tattoos too 
 this is one of my favorite stories to tell 
 people try to get free stuff out of us all the time as most feel our services should be free in the first place 
 sorry guys this is n't a discount <unk> 
 we 're an <unk> company <unk> by many big name theme parks 
 all our workers go through weeks worth of training before they touch a kids face and we do our best to give you your monies worth 
 it 's pricey sure but personally i feel its worth it 
 anyways 
 the story starts with a mother getting her daughter done up like a butterfly 
 the painter is going above and beyond with the design since there was complaints that the picture was too <unk> to justify the price from the mother 
 something like this only larger : when it was done the painter threw up some extra <unk> and stick on gems for extra measure and the kid was in love with it 
 the mother however was getting really huffy about it 
 & gt mom : it looks horrible nothing like the picture 
 & gt painter : erm ma'am you asked me to make it different from the picture ... & gt mom : shut up its ugly and i wo n't pay for it 
 come on honey we 're leaving 
 she seriously tried to storm away from the stand without paying for the work done- a huge no no 
 my co-worker gets in the way and in the most 'sympathetic voice says & gt painter : ohh i 'm sorry miss 
 i could never let you leave with such a horrible design i am so sorry 
 here let me clean your daughter off for you 
 & gt mom : wh- no we 're just- you can leave it- & gt painter : i insist 
 my co-worker proceeded to wipe the whole thing off in a single swipe of a wet cloth 
 kid was hysterical but years in this job makes you <unk> to a childs tears 
 sorry kiddo really 
 but it gives parents one less thing to try to guilt us with 
 her expression was priceless and she could n't get away from the stand quicker 
 hey kids 
 uncle gabriel ca n't sleep again so gather <unk> for another story 
 tonight 's tale is a story of desperation and rudeness that i 'm sure we 've all experienced in one form or another 
 like both of my previous stories this takes place at the grocer i worked for years ago 
 since this was <unk> and i was out of school i usually got the closing shifts as a cashier 
 this meant a lot of standing around and cleaning because small towns tend to go dead after sundown 
 as a preface to this story i want to give you a little background about how we close the store 
 when 10pm came we would turn off the sliding doors at the entrances and exits but we would only lock the entrance 
 this was because the night shift had to get in somehow and the rest of us had to leave as well 
 once all the tills had been closed for the night the program for the pos locked out until morning 
 one <unk> summer night we closed the store down promptly at 10 and i cashed out my drawer 
 since i was the only cashier this meant the system was now closed for good 
 while counting out in the break room the manager and i are startled to hear a voice call out 
 & gt '' hello '' 
 we return to the floor to find out that a woman has pried open the <unk> exit doors to force her way into the store 
 there ensued a conversation something like this : & gt woman : oh i 'm glad you 're here 
 your doors are n't working '' 
 & gt gabe : ... that 's because the entrance is locked ma'am 
 we close at ten every night and it 's now ... 
 <unk> '' 
 & gt w : oh but i just need to grab some brownie mix my daughter is having a party tomorrow '' 
 & gt g : i 'm sorry to tell you ma'am that we ca n't help you 
 we have no registers open and the system is closed for the night '' 
 & gt w : but i just need brownie mix 
 it will only take five minutes 
 you can do that right '' 
 at this point my manager intervened reiterating that we were closed and could not open another lane for her 
 much to my amusement that quickly turned to annoyance this woman was adamant that she get her brownie mix 
 in the end it came down to her <unk> & gt w : i 'm not leaving until you sell me brownie mix '' 
 fortunately my manager was having none of it 
 & gt manager : you can leave on your own or we can have you escorted out by the police '' 
 i 've <unk> been more proud of my bosses over the years than i was then 
 and fortunately for us both after a moment of slack jawed amazement the customer finally admitted defeat and left 
 <unk> these stories always wind up longer than i think they 'll be 
 thanks for reading tfr 
 i 'll share more stories with you all the next time i ca n't sleep 
 edit : words and <unk> 've worked in retail for just over 4 years but yesterday i finally had the customer from hell 
 i 'm a cashier in a pretty big sporting goods retail store 
 i genuinely like my job 
 my coworkers are great my managers and i get along really well 
 it 's snowed and got pretty cold in the past 2 weeks so everyone is panicking trying to buy <unk> 
 cue scene : lady comes in with a coat her sister bought for her kid 
 zipper almost ripped out of coat 
 the sister lives several hours away and has the receipt 
 we tell her the coat can be straight exchanged for the exact same coat she can get store credit or she can have her sister mail her the reciept 
 she agrees to an exchange 
 send her off into the wild she returns to cash with a different coat 
 oh joy 
 i explain that the coat is a different price but if she wants she can pay the difference $ 50+ 
 she 's having none of it and insists that her sister paid the same price $ 175 for the damaged coat 
 side note : that particular brand of coat does n't even come near $ 175 in any style 
 after a short argument we send her off again and she returns with another coat 
 still not the same one she 's trying to return 
 she says there is a $ 10 difference and she 's willing to pay that 
 i explain to her that because she has no reciept the return price on the damaged coat is actually $ 20 cheaper than the coat she 's trying to buy 
 she loses her mind and says you better get your manager back up here '' 
 while i 'm waiting on the manager she tells me she 's going to get her sisters credit card number and we can look up the receipt that way 
 uh no ... '' why not '' 
 we legally ca n't look through your sisters credit card history ... '' that 's ridiculous 
 manager comes back up explains to her the exact same thing i just told her she demands to speak to the store manager 
 he comes up and explains the exact same thing 
 at this point i 've stopped paying attention because i 'm helping other customers but she finally <unk> and after a comment of fine i 'll just do a straight exchange thanks for wasting half an hour of my time '' 
 we think shes gone 
 but no 
 sweet summer child 
 15 minutes later she returns shoves her phone in my face and tells me that we have to give her the other coat now because she has a picture of the receipt 
 i call the store manager back to cash and i 'm out 
 shift 's done i escape to the back and hide there watching the security camera with another manager until she 's gone 
 i head to the front to leave and the first manager tells me the lady called customer service while standing at the cash desk and straight up lied and said we refused to return the coat at all 
 manager then proceeded to try and tell cs that simply was n't true and psycho lady screamed at her excuse me am i talking to you '' 
 best part of the story the price her sister paid for the coat was price we offered to return it for 
 <unk> 
 tl dr bitch of a customer tries screaming loud enough to get her way doesnt <unk> and my managers stick up for <unk> time poster so a bit of background 
 i am a mature woman who has worked in an adult shop for nearly 12 months 
 i love my job 
 i work in a part of my town that includes some very colourful characters and some lovely people but also due to my work i have to on occasion deal with some very strange requests and some very <unk> people 
 if you like my story i will post more as they happen on a very regular basis 
 two days ago a very well dressed conservative looking gentleman of around 50 entered the store 
 he wandered around for a bit of a look before approaching my counter 
 on the wall behind me is a leather display 
 whips canes handcuffs and assorted bondage items 
 he looks up and says 'nice display 
 do you sell a lot of bondage items 
 'yes sir they are quite popular says i. looks me up and down <unk> you know where i could find a master 
 to clarify here 
 a master is a male <unk> of sorts i suppose is the best answer 
 someone who <unk> discipline to another and is paid to do so 
 this may involve being tied up forced to perform various duties and may also involve whips and canes and other forms of discipline 
 i have no idea where to find a master 
 'have you tried the internet sir 
 then he floors me 
 'i am trying to find a master to discipline my daughter 
 wtf 
 'my daughter has been unfaithful to her husband and we want to find a master to teach her a lesson 
 then he starts with the long story while i am trying to pick my lower jaw up off the shop floor 
 <unk> have found one and he says that he would like to cane her 
 of course her husband will be there for the disciplining session 
 the master wants to give her 150 lashes with the cane to start with 
 now i need your opinion 
 do you think this is too excessive to start with or do you think 150 lashes is fair 
 thankfully at this point another customer walked into the shop a lovely regular that always spends big so i replied to mr <unk> with 'i honestly do n't know too much about the bondage lifestyle sir so i do n't think i can comment on that and now i must go and help this gentleman 
 have a nice day 
 i 'm the customer in this story but i think all you tfr guys out there who work behind a deli counter will appreciate this 
 i was at the supermarket today and the deli counter had a huge line 
 there were three women working as fast as they <unk> could and honestly doing a great job of moving things along 
 i was almost done getting my cajun turkey when the woman being helped behind me let 's call her hamhocks asked her counter person to let her see the <unk> of the ham she had just sliced for her 
 the girl took the top slice off a pile that was at least a pound and i 'm telling you i could see through it 
 hamhocks is n't satisfied 
 & gt no that 's not thin 
 that 's too thick 
 they wo n't eat ham that thick 
 you 'll have to do it again 
 i 'm sorry * no she is n't * but i see thick slices there 
 so the girl puts the ham aside and starts slicing again 
 again hamhocks waits until the entire pound is sliced before asking to see the ham 
 it 's so thin it 's basically falling apart 
 the pieces are n't full size because there 's no way a slice that thin stays together 
 hamhocks grabs the top two pieces and says loudly angrily and with a pinched-up face : & gt what is this 
 is this how you slice ham 
 how the hell am i supposed to make a sandwich out of this 
 this is terrible 
 you do n't know what you 're doing 
 one of the other slicers comes up and says let me do it again for you i 'll do it just how you like it 
 and hamhocks shouts : & gt no 
 you 'll get it wrong 
 i 'm going somewhere else where they know how to slice ham 
 all the slicers and the rest of the customers stand there with their mouths open and watch her stomp off amazed at the display of <unk> they just got to witness 
 i tell the first slicer that first batch was transparent she 's clearly nuts '' 
 and a very <unk> dude behind me said she just wasted two perfectly good pounds of ham 
 give them to me i 'll buy it '' 
 **tl dr : ** apparently if ham is too thick it becomes poison 
 if it 's too thin it loses <unk> integrity and you ca n't make a sandwich with anything less than 3 '' x 4 '' perfect <unk> of ham 
 ham ham ham ham ham 
 so today at work i doing my cashier thing and a gentleman comes up to buy a drink and presents me with a bill '' that has been taped back together 
 this particular gentleman is shirtless twitchy and <unk> so small the are practically nonexistant 
 now normally a ripped bill would not be a problem ... if he : 1 had the whole thing ... he does not 
 there are clearly pieces missing 
 2 the pieces were even from the same bill ... as far as i could tell ... they were not 
 3 i would have even considered taking it if he had 51 % of the bill plus a serial number ... again ... nope 
 by presents me with the bill i mean he walks up sets down his drink and tosses the bill on the counter and looks up at me expectantly 
 i look at him ... look down at the bill look back up at him ... and he demands : well 
 me : dude ... seriously ... theres no way i can accept this.. customer : why the fck not 
 me : ... <unk> in pieces ... also ... you dont even have the whole thing ... do you have another form of payment 
 customer : common man but im really tired me : ... i cant accept parts of bills customer : but i worked all day amd im <unk> you tape it together more 
 me : there are pieces missing ... do you have another form of payment 
 customer : fine fck you then 
 at this point he <unk> the mangled bill at me and storms out 
 and here is the bill in question in all its glory : tl dr : meth is a hell of a drug 
 edit : i did some more research and a non mutilated bill can be exchanged at a local bank 
 a mutilated bill must be sent to the <unk> of printing and <unk> 
 a mutilated bill is <unk> that is not cleary more than 50 percent of the original bill and must be sent in with a <unk> stating estimated value and how it got mutilated 
 although the picture doesnt show it <unk> top left is a different color than the rest it appears 
 looks more to me like there are <unk> of two bills 
 maybe not tho 
 at any rate it may be technically legal tender for all <unk> public and private but not for spending in a retail store 
 edit 2 : technically / legally could i have accepted it 
 maybe 
 management would not have let that fly however and i would likely have gotten written up 
 also : after some more <unk> it probably wasnt meth based on a few peoples <unk> work at a fairly well known pizza chain in australia 
 and like all <unk> <unk> we get our share of whack jobs but this one from a few months back probably takes the cake 
 i was running the morning shift when a customer walked in 
 the other girl working with me who we will call jane went to serve this man who shall be called angry man am 
 she was down there for a few minutes before i started hearing raised voices 
 i rushed down to see what the commotion was 
 me : is everything alright here 
 am : no 
 this woman is trying to poison me 
 me : ... excuse me 
 am : i am lactose intolerant 
 me : ... okay 
 at this point jane walks away flustered 
 am : i asked for a pizza without cheese and she said she would remove the cheese 
 how dare she try and poison me like that 
 me : i 'm sorry sir i 'm not sure i understand the problem 
 am : talking like i 'm five i 'll start from the beginning shall i 
 i want to order ten pizzas 
 i run a large company i basically own half this town 
 i am lactose intolerant so i need a pizza without cheese 
 that woman said she will remove the cheese 
 making a pizza with cheese and then removing the cheese and giving it to me is <unk> me 
 me : i 'm sorry sir but i think there 's been a misunderstanding 
 what she meant is that we will remove cheese from your topping list - as in we wo n't put cheese on to start with 
 i 'm certain no one is trying to poison you 
 am : well that 's not what she said 
 me : i 'm sorry for the miscommunication 
 would you still like to place your order today 
 am : yes but i 'll expect some kind of compensation for having to deal with that evil woman 
 me : ... what exactly would you like 
 by this point another customer walks in we will call him reasonable man rm 
 am : well i think all ten pizzas for free should suffice 
 me : ... i 'm sorry sir i ca n't do that 
 i could throw in a couple of free garlic breads but i certainly ca n't do ten free pizzas over a misunderstood sentence 
 am : do you realise who i am 
 me : i 'm sorry sir i do n't 
 am : i own this town 
 if i walk out this door you wo n't have any business by next week 
 me : i 'm happy to help you today sir but unfortunately i ca n't give you ten free pizzas because of this 
 am : you 'll do ten free pizzas or you 'll lose your damn job 
 rm : excuse me but i think you need to calm down 
 am : this is assault 
 i 'm being assaulted 
 i 'll call the police 
 me : sir you can call the police but no one has touched you let alone assaulted you 
 angry man starts walking out yelling the entire time am : i 've been <unk> and assaulted 
 just you wait 
 this place will go under i swear it 
 i was left standing there basically gaping after him while reasonable man had a chuckle 
 this has been one of those customer horror stories that i tell every now and then and makes me wonder just how people can be so ridiculous 
 in case you were wondering we made record sales this summer despite that lunatic 's threats 
 just a little background : in the uk or at least this store the personal alcohol license is given to a couple of individuals rather than the business as a whole in this case to my two managers 
 this means they 're responsible of making sure we stick to the law when it comes to checking id and refusing sale to anybody who ca n't produce it or who is under the age of 18. this also means that if there is a group of young people you have to assume that it could be consumed by all of them and check all of the id 's to make a sale or if you get the impression somebody is purchasing not for themselves but for somebody who looks young you need to check that persons id 
 if you get caught selling alcohol to or to be consumed by somebody underage it is you personally who will get in trouble : you can loose your job and never be able to get a job in retail again and you can be fined up to <unk> $ 7167 through court or an on the spot fine of <unk> $ <unk> you personally not the store 
 this means you have a personal <unk> to be extra careful with alcohol sales 
 over this summer i was working in a mini <unk> shop on a coastal town which attracted a lot of tourism within the uk 
 without sounding snobby the place attracted a lot of people who could be considered a bit rough- all day drinking chain smoking swearing unruly kids 
 you know the sort 
 this one particular day i was working on the till and the shop was relatively empty when a woman and her child who looked to be about 15 wondered into the shop 
 they went over to the alcohol section which is just a few meters away from where i was standing and proceeded to have a loud conversation about what they were going to buy 
 i will call the woman w and the child c. i will be <unk> & gt w : i 'm getting some wine and some beer for your brothers 
 what do you want 
 & gt c : motioning at a bottle of cheap vodka can you get me this for tonight 
 & gt w : put it in the basket 
 anything else 
 & gt c : yeah and some of these too i love them picking up a <unk> of <unk> they were seemingly oblivious to me but being literally a couple of meters away and the store being quiet i had heard the entire conversation 
 when they came to pay i exchanged some pleasantries 
 & gt n : hey did you find everything okay 
 & gt w : <unk> me yeah yeah & gt n : okay great turns to c i 'm going to have to ask to see your id please 
 & gt w : assuming it was directed at her and sounding irritated i 'm 35 i 'm clearly over 18 & gt n : oh ... <unk> i meant your daughter 
 can i see your daughters id please 
 & gt w : but <unk> the one buying it 
 & gt n : i know you 're paying for it but a lot of the items are for your daughter 
 i need to see her id or i 'm afraid i ca n't sell any of this to you 
 & gt c : they 're not for me 
 & gt n : i was standing right here ... i literally heard your entire conversation ... & gt w : ca n't you just let it go this once 
 it 's her birthday 
 & gt n : no ... i really ca n't 
 now the woman looked really angry and just turned cussing loudly and walked out leaving me to put away her basket of shopping 
 i thought that was the last of it but she came in a couple of hours later by herself picked up the same items and attempted to buy them again 
 when i told her i still could n't sell them to her she started ranting loudly about how terrible the shop was and how she was going to complain and get me fired 
 sorry but i 'm not going to risk my job and a fine to sell alcohol to your obviously underage <unk> do n't know if this story belongs here or not but it is a funny story and i hope you might enjoy 
 many years ago i was working in a call center on a variety of projects 
 a particular project asked us to get as <unk> as possible with their clients in order to better tailor our sales <unk> sell pitch 
 one particular call i was talking with an elderly woman ew from here on out and i could hear some children in the background apparently playing 
 i asked the client are those your children i hear in the background '' 
 ew : no they are my grandchildren 
 do you have children lcnite 
 lcnite : no but my wife and i are considering it 
 ew : oh really 
 well do you want a boy or a girl 
 lcnite : to be honest just i just want a healthy child but being a man i would love to have a son 
 at this time my client decided to <unk> into a 30 minute detailed explanation on how to guarantee a son 
 she told me preparation steps to take before sex the positions to finish in and even things that my wife should do to ensure our success in creating a boy 
 okay so that was cringe worthy but i got the sale and i was pretty happy with it ... until my supervisor pulled me to her desk 
 super : umm lcnite i listened to that last call and i just wanted to let you know that you could have ended that call at any point the moment she brought up your wife and beyond 
 lcnite : well that 's okay i got the sale and you and i are both adults and married and only you and i know what kind of discussion that was so hey it 's all good 
 after a call that long though i do need a smoke so i am going to take a break 
 super : go ahead 
 enjoy 
 come back to my desk fifteen minutes later 
 my supervisor calls me to her desk again 
 super : umm ... lcnite got a little bit of news ... lcnite : okay sure thing 
 what 's up 
 super : well it turns out that i was not the only one on that call 
 quality control also happened to be listening 
 lcnite : oh jeez ... well nothing i can do now but hide my head and carry on 
 super : there is actually a bit more 
 see this is still a test bed program and so from time to time the director might <unk> a call 
 she was on this one too 
 lcnite : crap 
 that is embarrassing 
 her husband works with my wife 
 this should make for interesting conversation 
 okay well anyone have any negative feedback 
 super : nope everyone thought you did great and you should be commended 
 lcnite : awesome so can i put this into practice and take the rest of the day off 
 hehe ... super : no sorry there is one more piece 
 see from time to time the client will also dial in ... and since this is the pilot the client is the board of directors ... so good on you 
 you impressed the client greatly 
 lcnite : ... slinks off in shame 
 nine months later upon the birth of my first child my wife and i received a lovely gift basket at the hospital 
 the card was signed as follows : -- - congratulations on the newest edition to the lcnite family 
 we hope the instructions worked out for you 
 congratulations on the boy 
 signed -- the board of directors edit : thank you to who ever gave me gold 
 very kind <unk> i work at a pretty big grocery store in downtown toronto and i was on my lunch break today and i walked past one of the aisles and there was a little girl probably about 3 or 4 years old sitting on the ground all by herself crying so i went up to her and said hey are you alright '' 
 and she did n't answer me so i said do you know where your mom and dad are '' 
 and she gave me a muffled no '' so i said do you want me to sit with you for a while until they come back '' 
 and she was like uh huh '' so i sat down on the ground next to her and i had a couple of paid stickers in my pocket that we put on items that are too big for a bag and i said can i give you this super special sticker 
 it 's actually magic because when you put it on your parents will know exactly where to find you '' and i put it on her hand and she stopped crying and just stared at the sticker for a while and then i asked her who her favorite princess was and we started talking about beauty and the <unk> and then a few minutes later her mom comes running down the aisle screaming <unk> '' 
 and the mom turns to me and shakes my hand and starts thanking me almost in tears and it made me feel so good to know that i made that little girl feel a little bit better because i think we all know how scary it was to be lost in a big store like that when you are so young 
 tl dr i 'm gon na be a really fuckin good dad when i grow <unk> a few years go i used to work for a convenience shop in the uk it 's one of the very large ones 
 it was about 10pm we shut at 10.30pm when a few customers came in 
 one of them was a woman who looked a little strange the usual crazy eyes odd clothing strange smell 
 when she had finished shopping and got to my till she quietly asked under her breath & gt can you help me take my shopping to my car i think there 's somebody following me around the shop now we have no obligation to help customers with their shopping once we 've taken their money but i occasionally helped nice old people but this woman seemed very agitated and scared 
 i 'd not seen anyone following her and i thought she was delusional but i thought that if it calmed her down by helping her with her shopping i might as well do it 
 the next 20 minutes passed without incident and i cashed up my till 
 after cashing up i remembered what the woman had said so i decided to check the cctv from when she was in the shop 
 lo and behold there was a man following her around the shop 
 he stayed at quite a distance from her pretending to look at items on the shelf and putting items in a basket but always keeping her within his eye line 
 whenever she went around a corner he 'd move quickly around a <unk> corner to continue to keep an eye on her from a distance 
 the real kicker was that when i helped her with her shopping he placed his semi-full basket on the floor followed us out of the shop and got in a car in the car park and continued to follow her 
 a scary thought is that i 'd not even noticed him he was following her that well 
 we called the <unk> : my first job was in a knife store in los angeles when i was 15. the owner was an old veteran from chicago 
 i basically had run of the place provided i did n't do anything <unk> stupid or if i did i cleaned up afterwards 
 **the scary little <unk> i was doing inventory and stock checks one weekend morning when a friend of mine came in 
 he shared my passion for all things blunt or bladed and i knew him well enough to trust him to walk around behind the counter and investigate items at his <unk> 
 a customer came in an almost <unk> cute asian girl probably just shy of five feet 
 i started over to her with a traditional <unk> '' 
 one word - no reply necessary or even expected greeting when my friend makes a beeline for her 
 this can pretty much only be entertaining and i figure i can throw something at him if the situation gets out of control or he says something too stupid 
 & gt friend : hey 
 how can i help you 
 & gt girl : um i do n't know 
 i 'm looking for something for protection 
 a friend of mine got mugged recently 
 my friend proceeds to tell her about the various stun gun and pepper spray options 
 i keep an eye on them an extra minute to make sure he does n't <unk> one of them or something then go back to checking inventory 
 i can hear him chatting her up a little but i 'm not really paying attention when he comes over to me 
 & gt uh <unk> can you help me out here 
 this kinda did n't go the way i thought it would 
 i turn around and the girl has a <unk> volt stun baton pepper spray and a hand ax with an <unk> individual knuckle guard 
 think smallish ax with brass knuckles for the handle 
 & gt me : hey friend tells me you have some questions 
 & gt girl : no i think i 'm getting these 
 keep in mind this girl is tiny 
 the ax is longer than her forearm and the stun baton is n't the usual subtle little device most people like for protection 
 it 's about ten inches with electricity arcing around it 
 & gt me : did i hear you say you wanted this for protection 
 this is all a bit much for any day to day carry 
 also bladed weapons are n't good for self defense unless you really know how to use them 
 any weapon you do n't know how to use belongs to your <unk> '' 
 & gt girl : i just want to look scary 
 do you think people will be afraid to come near me 
 & gt me : well yeah you effectively scared off friend and i could n't do that throwing knives at him 
 that ax is n't street legal though 
 & gt girl : it 's going next to my bed 
 i shrugged gave her a quick once over on the laws and maintenance around the baton and pepper spray and rang her out 
 friend came over to me after she left 
 & gt me : decided not to ask her out 
 she 's cute you can probably still catch her 
 & gt friend : next to her bed 
 she 's putting the ax next to her bed 
 no i 'm not going to f***ing ask her out 
 <unk> edit : i was at this job for over 7 years so i have a lot of stories 
 i 'll probably put one up every few days or so until i get bored or everyone gets sick of em 
 that said other tales from the knife store : pointing fingers robot pirates why would you say that 
 <unk> clear safe words it never rains <unk> therapy behind the scenes warning shot control freak backlash just a flesh wound fortune and a dart gun the <unk> bad <unk> but i want it 
 the good samaritan princess and her gang a stupid question the ornery <unk> this happened about a month ago but seeing the recent posts about kids made me want to share a happier story 
 i 'm sorry the story is long and i 'm having trouble <unk> it blame the neighbors who are having a loud party my head is filled with bass 
 a mom and a little girl maybe 4 at the oldest come in and are browsing 
 it 's a slow day and they 're the only customers in the store 
 the little girl is following very closely behind her mom saying things like mommy look 
 this is so pretty '' 
 and general ooh-ing and aah-ing 
 the mom is fantastic looking at everything her daughter points out but also reminding her to be careful 
 the phrase that stuck out to me most was & gt remember do n't touch 
 things can break so to look you only have to use your eyes you do n't need to use your hands '' 
 the little girl is listening and doing what she 's told but getting her face super close to the displays so she could see better 
 it was the cutest thing i 've ever seen 
 her mom gently tells her she does n't have to stand so close and at this point i 'm beyond shocked with how loving but firm but also <unk> she is with this little girl 
 it seemed too good to be true 
 and it was 
 i hear a mischievous little giggle then a crash 
 i rush over to make sure that no one is hurt 
 before i say anything the mom is on her knees looking the little girl in the eyes asking her what happened 
 i hung a few steps back since i did n't want to interrupt the parenting and could see the girl was n't hurt 
 so i started cleaning up the broken <unk> 
 the little girl looks at me like she 's so scared i 'm going to be mad and says & gt '' i 'm sorry please do n't be mad i touched it and i should n't have but it fell and broke my hands did n't listen my brain told me not to but my hands ... '' and she keeps going on nervously 
 i stop her and tell her that it 's okay accidents happen even i break things accidentally sometimes 
 the mom offers to pay for the damaged item 
 we do n't have a you break it you buy it policy 
 accidents happen we mark the item out <unk> of it safely and move on 
 i tell her this and she goes about shopping making the girl hold her hand and keeping an eye on her just being an all around awesome parent 
 as they were checking out the little girl looks at me and i <unk> down so i can talk to her 
 she says very matter of <unk> & gt '' thanks for being so nice 
 us kids we 're people too 
 we have bad days and sometimes our hands do stuff our mommy says not to '' 
 i could n't stop laughing and all i got out was & gt '' yes 
 kids are people too 
 i saw you had your hands held tightly so they were good the rest of the time you were in here 
 thank you for being so brave and telling me about it and for listening so well '' 
 she smiled and said & gt '' yes i am good 
 and i am brave '' 
 tldr : kid breaks thing 
 mom is amazing parent 
 kid and mom go on happy kid tells me kids are people with mischievous hands 
 i was returning a bike wrong size and a couple other little things at the local edited to protect the something last weekend 
 i walked up the the service desk and there was no line 
 so we started the returns from 2 different purchases 
 the first went through no problem but the second return for the bike they had to call someone up to make sure they could accept the return large ticket item i guess the whole time this is going on a small line forms 
 nothing too crazy but it happens 
 the person working the desk was very nice and helpful 
 so we are waiting on the manager to come approve the return when this <unk> old bitch cob from the line hollers girl you best get on the damn phone and get someone else to help us '' 
 the girl behind the counter looks at me and says see what i deal with every day '' 
 and ignores the lady 
 i remember all of you fine folks and decided that i 'm going to speak up because i know the employee ca n't 
 just not sure what to do yet ... a few minutes goes by and the manager comes up and he asks why i 'm returning the bike and i tell him and crack a joke we both start to laugh and i hear cob say white boy thinks he funny slowing down the line '' 
 i instantly make eye contact with her and she looks away ... so the manager approves the return and we get everything sorted out 
 i tell the lady behind the counter thank you and i turn to leave but i stop and i raise my hands and in a nice <unk> voice say folks i know i held up the line and i want to apologize to all of you for the delay except for you '' 
 i point my arm out and stare right at cob 
 the rest of the line looks at her too 
 i said you need to be more patient and learn some manners '' 
 i turned around and walked away 
 a few years back i used to work at a medium sized supermarket in the uk and this post just reminded me of this incident i had a middle aged woman come up to me and simply shout mayonnaise '' 
 in my face 
 it took me a second to realise that this was a question/request and that she wanted to be taken to the mayonnaise 
 after we arrived at the mayo section she angrily asks me where 's the ketchup 
 naturally i was confused 
 **me : ** well you asked for mayonnaise ... **angry lady : ** but i want ketchup **me : ** ... <unk> did you ask for mayonnaise 
 **angry lady : ** because it should be with the ketchup 
 i then took her to the ketchup which incidentally was the other side of the damned store 
 i work at a store that sells everything as an associate and sometimes cashier 
 surprisingly this is n't about a work experience i had but an experience as a customer 
 <unk> okay for christmas my friends with benefits at the time bought me a vibrator 
 the batteries ran out so i decided even though i hate buying these things to go to the store and purchase some batteries and some <unk> for fun time later 
 i find the items no problem and then go through a check out line 
 i think i just buy these two things and candy bar 
 the cashier looks at my items then looks at me 
 he says 
 we both know why your buying these items '' 
 i feel my face getting warm 
 and just laugh nervously 
 well it would have been more awkward if i had n't said anything '' 
 he said to me 
 i 'd have to <unk> worked in a very large supermarket near cincinnati 
 this store had everything a <unk> could ever need -- your cincinnati sports merchandise <unk> <unk> in cans cincinnati cincinnati cincinnati etc 
 enter a lady and her friends 
 they walk right past all of the cincinnati-related merchandise and go straight for the electronics 
 they request the most expensive stuff that we sell and lots of it 
 multiple laptops multiple tablets cell phones etc 
 it 's all in lockup so the customers must tell the cashiers they want all of those things 
 well when one of them requested $ 15,000 worth of <unk> electronics it caught the managers <unk> because <unk> ever buys that much 
 perhaps she was buying gifts for all of her friends in <unk> 
 who knows 
 the transaction was <unk> closely by pretty much everyone in charge 
 the cashier per procedure requests id from the lady 
 the lady presents it without hesitation 
 it 's scratched up and looks a little flimsy for a government id -- but hey lots of ids look weird like that 
 right 
 so the cashier finally reads the info on the id which is as follows : - <unk> whatsherface - <unk> someplace rd - <unk> <unk> <unk> to the shock of everyone her payment was declined 
 she tried to raise a <unk> stink about it to get it through 
 she threatened to sue us threatened to call corporate made all sorts of threats 
 still we were forced to inform her that the machine would n't take her payment because the city of <unk> '' does n't exist 
 finally the lady gives up 
 she takes her id payment and leaves empty-handed with her friends 
 but that 's not the end of this story 
 this lady might not be able to spell the town that she lives in but she 's a <unk> criminal with lots of tricks up her sleeve 
 that 's why the very next day she walked in to the *same* store requested the *same* merchandise and tried to present the *same* misspelled id for verification 
 she was arrested on the spot 
 typical day at work yesterday in a big retailer 
 big guy says <unk> me '' 
 retail smile 
 hi 
 what can i do for you '' 
 he points behind me 
 see that guy over there '' 
 i turn around 
 sure enough there is a large man in a trucker cap standing on the other side of the counter 
 the counter creates a kind of booth 
 customers can approach from any angle 
 the first man speaks again 
 that man wants to see your beanbag '' 
 a moment of panic flashes through my mind 
 why would this guy want to see my beanbag 
 it 's not a particularly impressive beanbag 
 also why is this guy asking for this other guy 
 is he some kind of hired <unk> 
 a <unk> that gets dudes to show off their beanbags 
 all i manage to say is uh ... '' the first man speaks 
 you guys normally have beanbags on display all over the place 
 we ca n't find any '' 
 finally i realize that he 's not talking about my beanbag in particular but beanbag **chairs** 
 relief <unk> over me 
 oh those 
 have n't been in since christmas 
 management orders a bunch of them a couple of times a year then we 'll go months in between without them 
 you can still get them online though '' 
 the two men leave somewhat disappointed and my beanbag <unk> after having retracted itself into my <unk> work at a large arts and crafts store where cranky women love to roam when they have nothing better to do 
 i 'm also 17 and do homeschooling so i work a lot for the store 
 this is my first story but i 've got a ton more that i can share 
 so the night before last i was working and my register got super backed up 
 i was gon na call for back up and i had a few times before but i could n't because we were understaffed for the night and all the people working were busy 
 so i 'm trying to get everyone in line out as quickly as possible and it 's pretty obvious 
 so this one lady like a couple customers back goes hey you know a lot of people are waiting is there someone you could call or something since you ca n't seem to ring people up quickly enough '' 
 mind you she was rude as hell while saying this 
 and i go yes ma'am for sure 
 just give me one second and i 'll do that '' 
 even though i 'd tried previously 
 so i finish checking out the customer that 's ringing up while like five other people wait and i call for back up on the registers again 
 so right after that i turn back to the lady who initially asked and i go sorry about that ma'am we 're just understaffed tonight and i 'm doing my best '' 
 said all that <unk> politely too 
 and then she has the arrogance to say oh yeah i was just asking 
 i do n't need the attitude '' 
 reminder that i was being polite as hell so the best part about this story is the fact that the customer i 'd previously been ringing up turned to the lady and was like um no ma'am he was being really polite 
 there was no attitude in what he said you should calm down '' 
 the woman looked super embarrassed and to top it off the next lady i checked out whispered to me do n't worry about her 
 you were very polite and she 's just a bitch '' 
 it took everything i had not to laugh 
 by now one of my coworkers had come up and was checking people out 
 the woman who said i had attitude ended up going to my coworkers register and by the time she 'd gotten checked out i had checked out like two or three people that were behind her originally 
 karma 's a bitch 
 i hope you enjoyed waiting an extra ten minutes to get checked out by going into the other line when you were so obviously in a rush 
 i used to work at a little village green type shopping centre on the very edge of the cbd 
 medium sized supermarket bakery newsagent sandwich shop and a cafe were the only shops there 
 i worked at the bakery right next to the main exit of the supermarket 
 all the walls were glass so i could see the whole front of the supermarket 
 being on the edge of the cbd and the clubbing district there were a lot of less <unk> characters read : alcoholics or drug addicts who would go into the supermarket and <unk> 
 i usually saw them leaving the supermarket with their ill gotten goods and would try to point them out to staff but most times would n't be able to since they 'd go in with the lunch rush when the supermarket and bakery were flat out 
 when i was able to notify the staff they usually could n't get out in time to stop them 
 there was one time that the girl working front end managed to get a guy who stole medicine though 
 this is that story 
 so it 's a quiet day at the village green 
 i 'm bored and making faces at my friend who works at the supermarket when i notice a dodgy looking character leaving the supermarket 
 this guy is maybe 6 foot and really dirty 
 stained clothes ratty hair and beard skinny as a <unk> a stereotypical drug attict looking guy 
 if he was a disney character he 'd be an evil rat <unk> to the main bad guy 
 after he thinks he 's out of sight of the supermarket he stops and pulls some boxes of medication out of his hoodie <unk> or something i 'm not sure 
 i make eye contact with my friend and nod my head towards the shop lifter 
 i expected him to go out and handle this since he 's a 6 foot 3 broad <unk> <unk> but no 
 the little 5 foot nothing petite blonde chick who looks like a sneeze would knock her over sees my nod towards the shop lifter and takes this upon herself 
 she gets out from behind the front end counter faster than anyone i 've seen walks out the store comes up behind the man and taps him on the shoulder 
 when he turns around she simply grabs the boxes and says thank you 
 do n't come back please '' 
 with a huge grin on her face then goes back into the store 
 the shoplifter was left standing there too dumbfounded to say or do anything and just wandered off while my friend and i just laughed our asses off 
 edit : cbd = central business district 
 this is where most offices are within a city 
 sorry i did n't explain that i assumed it was a commonly used term everywhere not just australia 
 edit 2 : why are so many people getting <unk> at me for using the term cbd 
 since the name of my city refers to a vary large area including quite a few suburbs the term cbd is what most people here use when referring to just the actual city '' part 
 i 'm sorry this is confusing for so many people 
 edit 3 : the quick aussie <unk> guide 
 cbd : see above 
 newsagent : a person or a shop selling newspapers and magazines 
 also sells stationary has some legal forms does <unk> sells drinks etc 
 flat out : just means really really busy 
 <unk> 
 sorry we ca n't meet you for coffee 
 with the kids sick and getting the house ready to sell we 're flat out 
 i work in a big city that is very <unk> diverse 
 i also happen to work at an electronics store that sells computers 
 i also happen to be a woman who has piercings 
 while this is not a big deal in my store we 're encouraged to be individuals 
 it helps us connect with customers it is occasionally a huge issue with my customers 
 i had a very conservative older man in the other day who was looking for help finding a desktop 
 we 've been slammed lately because everyone is getting tax returns back and i had a few customers stacked 
 i went up to him and said something along the lines of hi i 'm so sorry but all my associates are busy right now 
 as soon as one of us <unk> up we can be over to help you guys out 
 it 'll only be about five minutes at this point '' 
 he looks right at me and says if i wanted some stupid girl who is dumb enough to <unk> her body with gross rings note only one of my piercings is visible at work i would have found asked for you '' 
 okay <unk> right 
 whatever i 'm used to it 
 so i went to my home theater department and grabbed one of my guy friends i 'll call him a who works in that department and told him i needed help with a customer 
 he then asks old dude if he needs help and old dude happily tells him about why he needs a new computer 
 a said something along the lines of well actually know nothing about computers but <unk> over there can help you '' to which i replied oh no i ca n't i 'm too stupid and <unk> for this 
 you got it a '' 
 of course old dude asked to speak to a supervisor 
 who happens to be female 
 he then demanded to talk to my manager who is also a female 
 after hearing the whole story my manager kicks him out because he was being a <unk> and harassing female staff 
 tl dr do n't mess with the dumb women '' in a store 
 we might have more power than all the men 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 this story has absolutely nothing to do with that 
 **story : ** my daughter and i spent the day in an orlando theme park yesterday not run by a mouse 
 not the best idea since it was a holiday weekend but she loves harry potter and i love here so daddy will brave the crowds when she really wants to go 
 while we were browsing in one of the stores i saw some crazy lady going off on a poor cashier 
 i made my way near them so i could hear what was going on <unk> because i felt like i should say something to the shitty customer but mostly because i’m <unk> as hell 
 the customer was ranting about the price of something and was basically accusing the cashier of trying to rip her off for charging so much 
 i honestly didn’t catch what item she was upset about but apparently whatever it was justified screaming at the poor female cashier behind the counter 
 the female cashier had to be in her teens and she honestly looked like she was about to break down and cry at any time 
 i <unk> wanted to step in and say something to the <unk> but i was worried about getting into an argument with some stranger in front of my daughter 
 enter the store manager 
 the guy comes rushing over and plants himself between the screaming lady and the cashier 
 he did it so smoothly i was <unk> 
 he walked behind the counter and with a quick movement used his arm to gently move the cashier back while placing himself in the line of fire 
 while he was moving the cashier back and stepping <unk> them he was looking at the screaming lady 
 by stepping in he broke the <unk> eye contact with the cashier and took it over for himself 
 smooth brother smooth 
 then even more impressively he told the ranting customer that if she was unhappy with the price she should leave 
 for those of you unfamiliar with theme parks in orlando this is definitely not the way it’s usually handled 
 too often the screaming guests get away with just about anything 
 watching the outcome definitely made me feel good and i was glad to see a manger stand up and put an unreasonable customer in their place 
 ten minutes later i was spending $ 117.65 for an <unk> ravenclaw <unk> 
 maybe the lady was right 
 -- -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here he went fishing by himself and never came home 
 they found him the next day 
 <unk> it <unk> drowning 
 he was a genuine person brightened up a room just by being in it 
 he was always happy and made the best of every situation 
 even working in a crappy fast food restaurant never brought him down 
 he would whistle while he worked constantly 
 through rushes and slow <unk> during the dirtiest hardest cleaning jobs he never stopped whistling unless it was to smile 
 i do n't know how to move on from here 
 there 's a hole in my store 
 for 40 hours a week he was a joy to work with and outside of work he was one of the few employees that i could call friend 
 i 'm going to miss him so much 
 i do n't know why i posted this here 
 i guess i just needed to get it out 
 i 've never had anyone close to me die i do n't know how to cope 
 anyway thanks for listening 
 edit : thank you all so much for your kind words 
 the funeral was today so i missed my chance to say these things to his family in person but i 've decided to write a letter to tell them how much he meant to us at the store and to me personally 
 i really ca n't thank you all enough for your kindness and advice 
 i know i 'll be back here reading all of this when i feel like i ca n't take it anymore 
 you are all wonderful 
 so i work at a chain of supermarkets in australia 
 the store i work at is the <unk> store for my state and it 's very big shiny and posh 
 we get a lot of snotty customers from the area 
 of course that means that a whole bunch of customers are quite rude 
 so today i was working <unk> in the bakery mostly alone as my co-workers were doing things around the store 
 we sell cakes for $ 34.99 these cakes are kinda a <unk> but they are pretty good and get good <unk> 
 anyway a middle-aged woman comes up to the <unk> and i ask her what she wants 
 she proceeds to explain that the deli across the road has the same cakes on for $ 28 
 i still do n't know if this is true as then they would have been making a loss on the cakes and they were likely on sale and going out of date 
 i 'll call the customer cl for cake lady : cl : so can i have the pink one for $ 30 me : uh no i 'm sorry we do n't change the prices of cakes cl : but i can get other ones of the same brand for $ 28 across the road me : i 'm sorry it 's not possible cl : what about price-match 
 me : price match is only for grocery items i 'm sorry cl : it 's for my daughters birthday party 
 me : *sigh* would you like me to get the manager 
 cl : yes i get the manager of the bakery she explains the same thing 
 so the woman leaves all huffy muttering about price-match 
 about 20 minutes later we get a call over the pa for the bakery manager to the front to settle an issue 
 the bakery is right across from the registers and i can see that it 's the same lady <unk> the checkout guy about price-match 
 i watch the manager go over explain the same thing i explained before and eventually the store manager has to explicitly tell cl that it ca n't happen before she gets it 
 the checkout guy comes over later and says so basically that woman 's daughter is n't worth an extra 5 bucks '' i would n't be surprised if she 's back tomorrow for another try 
 edit : i just got told that she took her complaint all the way to head office i hope they still told her no 
 no one told me we have to change anything so i can assume that they brought it up as an example of what price match does n't cover at 16 i was finally able to get a job and start making me some monies 
 applied at a few local places and ended up taking a job at fat krispy chicken <unk> 
 for the few weeks there were no issues 
 i was a computer nerd already so learning the register and procedures was a <unk> 
 i only worked 12 hours per week still being in highschool 
 my manager was a 25 <unk> bitch at this point 
 she 'd been thin and pretty but <unk> when she started working there and had gained quite a bit of weight due to her free manager meals of complete <unk> 
 she hated that i packed a lunch from home instead of eating the slop we served 
 topping it off i 'd caught on to things way quicker than she had and people talked about it and it caused her to hate me 
 in my third week i 'm up front manning the register when a couple walks in ... a very large couple 
 <unk> each 
 the man <unk> up to the counter and makes their to-go order of a 14 piece family meal with a family sized side of potato wedgies and two family sized mashed potatoes 
 i 'm thinking this is a big order but their big people and i do n't know how many people they 're going to be feeding anyway 
 i ring the order in and tell him his total and his wife suddenly looks pissed and yells : i 'm eating too '' 
 ... wut 
 she orders 24 hot wings and two family sized orders of potato wedgies 
 seriously 
 she then follows that up with and i need a large diet coke '' 
 at which the man chimes in that he needs a large diet coke as well 
 i 'm laughing internally at this point but it is a to-go order and they probably have a few kids or another family coming over ... something 
 right 
 it has to be 
 their order comes up and they take the gargantuan bags of food ... to the dine-in tables 
 me : i 'm sorry folks i thought you 'd ordered that for take-out i could get you some trays if you 'd like '' 
 man : do n't need trays 
 we always order take-out because i 'm not paying tax to eat here 
 cheap fucks 
 they just spent nearly $ 40 on food but ca n't pay the tax 
 eh 
 whatever 
 i go about my day and start cleaning the lobby 
 i 'm mopping and trying to ignore them so they can eat in peace when they stand up 
 i figured something must be wrong so i look to see and ... the food 's all gone 
 in roughly 7 minutes 
 nearly 17,000 calories of extra krispy wings and potatoes 
 stunned silence 
 i 'm staring at the trays covered in bones and destruction that these customers kindly left for us to clean instead of throwing their trash out 
 woman notices me staring and and gets pissed 
 calls for manager 
 manager comes up and listens to how badly i treated them by acting like she would n't be eating too and then making fun of them for eating a healthy wut 
 meal 
 she told me in front of the customers that i had two choices 
 1. apologize to the customers for my rudeness and take a write up or 2. termination 
 fat lady customer was smiling and pleased with herself 
 i laughed and told her if working there was going to turn me into a fat angry <unk> like her and our wonderful customers then leaving this job would be a <unk> 
 took my apron off and put it on the counter clocked out and headed for the door 
 the whole time the <unk> are bitching at me and manager both : come back here 
 are you going to let him ... '' 
 and manager is trying to calm them down and yell at me : come back here 
 you ca n't do ... '' and it 's all just background noise because it suddenly feels like all weight and stress has been removed from my shoulders 
 still one of my best <unk> memories.hello tfr 
 my job is a <unk> at a <unk> store in the south a little back story on this 
 i was working register one day when ignorant homophobe ih comes in 
 & gt **me** : hello sir how are you doing today & gt **ih** : pack of cigarette brand 1 and pack of cigarette brand 2 & gt as i 'm turning around with his cigarettes in my hand and ih notices my rainbow plug in my right ear & gt **ig** : you know you got that <unk> on the queer side right 
 & gt **me** : i 'm sorry 
 & gt **ig** : that plug you got it on the side that tells people that you 're a queer & gt **me** : sir i do happen to be gay it 's even a rainbow plug & gt **ih** : i refuse to buy any cigarettes from a queer like you then 
 get someone else up here and get out fuck out of my sight 
 & gt **me** : sir i happen to be the only one to work register at the moment would you still like to purchase these items 
 & gt ih storms off and yells homophobic remarks at me while he storms off later that week i was put on kitchen duty and around 4 pm ih walks in and orders a sandwich unaware that i 'm in the kitchen at the pick up window now and i see him waiting for his food and hoping he does n't remember me i call out his food order 
 **me** : guest number bla bla bla turkey on white extra mayo 
 ih walks up **ih** : fuck your queer ass again 
 did you make my food 
 **me** : yes sir is there a problem with that **ih** : i want someone normal to remake it i 'm not eating this shit 
 **me** : in a calm but in a i wish you 'd fuck off voice sir i can assure you there is nothing wrong with this sandwich 
 please take it ih takes the sandwich removes it from the bag then removes it from the wrapping paper 
 then throws the sandwich at me though the pick up window **ih** : burn in hell for your sins i 'm not coming back in here until i get you fired 
 a week later i 'm called into the office about a complaint company policy that we go over any complaints about the employee **manager** : it says here on this complaint last week you spit in a mans food and later saw you smoking marijuana in the parking lot whats your comment on this 
 **me** : that did n't happen at all i would n't even dream about spitting in another person 's food let alone with somewhere that has an open <unk> i get cut off by the manager **manager** : that 's what the complaint said but i know you would n't do anything like that and saw you had a sandwich thrown at you on the cctv 
 do you need another shirt to replace the possibly stained one 
 **me** : i 'm good thank you 
 **manager** : do n't let anyone bring you down 
 you do n't have to put up with this kind of shit now get back out there and if anyone like that comes up to you again do n't hesitate to call me out 
 that day i knew that my manager will always have my back against <unk> along with my other team mates : d tl dr : homophobe refused to eat sandwich i made him throws it at me complains to try and get me fired 
 it 's okay to be <unk> 'm a manager at a large liquor store 
 i will start this by saying that one of my cashiers has a very slight form of autism 
 she 's a great cashier her drawer is never off her memory is amazing and for the most part she 's super friendly 
 she is also very dry <unk> and does n't take kindly to sarcasm from customers 
 yesterday i was helping another cashier box up a large order when this douche bag old guy comes up to her register 
 he puts everything he has on the counter she rings it in bags it up and tells him his total 
 he hands her his cash and she gets his change 
 as she is trying to hand him his change he decides he wants it broke down differently 
 her response to him was amazing 
 i did n't hear everything he said but he called her stupid because she gave him his change back different than what he wanted even though he gave her no instructions 
 she straight face looked him in the eyes and told him that it 's against company policy for her to be insulted by customers '' and then told him to get the hell out 
 i have never laughed so hard at the look on someones face 
 it was <unk> was n't actually selling anything to the guy as i work for parks and <unk> but i had an interesting argument with a patron over park rules 
 he did n't seem to notice that i was arguing in his favor ... patron : excuse me can i bring beer to the concert in the park tonight 
 me : absolutely 
 you can bring any of your own alcohol in but our vendors wo n't be <unk> patron : interrupting me <unk> no i ca n't 
 me : sir you are welcome to bring whatever you 'd like to drink in the park 
 wine beer soda anything 
 patron : but there 's no alcohol allowed 
 me : yes there is sir 
 it 's always been allowed 
 patron : get me your supervisor 
 i get my supervisor who tells the man the exact same things again 
 he gets into his car and storms off ... <unk> at a food stand at the canadian national <unk> <unk> hands lady three ice cream cones * this lady is standing in front of our stand watching her kids get on some ride not even under the <unk> area right in the sunlight 
 i can already tell this is n't going to end well 
 about two to three minutes later they 're still on the ride 
 she comes back to the stand 
 lady : hi can i get two new ice cream cones 
 mine are melting 
 co-worker wendy : ... lady : they 're for my kids they went on the ride 
 wendy : um ... i can flip the cones over into cups and put them in our freezer for you 
 lady : no no no i want new ones 
 just throw these ones away 
 wendy : is 14 years old confused just throws them away at this point i notice what 's happening and walk over 
 me : was there a problem with the cones miss 
 lady : yes they were melting 
 i do n't understand why you all are making this so difficult i just want them not to melt all over my hands 
 i asked for a cup to put them in but this girl pointing to co-worker just threw them away before i could stop her 
 my poor co-worker 's is exasperated mentally <unk> with me to end her suffering 
 manager comes in : we saw wendy give you a perfectly reasonable option 
 it 's not our problem what happens to your ice cream once it leaves our stand you should have waited until your kids were off the ride to buy them 
 <unk> is looking around for the cones wanting to hand them back to her and realizes wendy threw them away * manager : here 's your $ 6 back 
 i 'm sure there are several ice cream places along the stretch that would love your business 
 lady : customer service in this place is horrible no wonder people hate coming to the ex 
 manager : <unk> guest services is right down there i 'm sure they 'd be eager to receive a complaint from a guest ca n't understand that ice cream <unk> when it 's hot outside 
 lady leaves bewildered that we still would n't replace her ice <unk> still not <unk> enough to recognize her own stupidity 
 today a customer was trying to pay for her purchase and was at the point where she needed to chose debit or credit 
 she looked up at me and asked do you matter '' 
 before i could reply she had the greatest look of embarrassment as she realized what she had said 
 i knew she had pulled an 'are you fucking sorry so i said well i hope i matter to someone '' 
 as she was leaving she turned to me and said you matter to me '' 
 people are <unk> i recently got a job at a family owned jewelry store that 's very well known in my area 
 it 's seasonal but the pay is good plus i get commission for every piece of jewelry i sell 
 so anyway i clock in at 10 this morning then immediately go to use the bathroom 
 as soon as i get out and start walking to my post the owner and my paycheck <unk> we 'll call him mr. b pulls me aside 
 & gt '' i have a present for you '' he tells me 
 then he hands me a cute little gift bag from bath and body works and tells me merry christmas 
 inside was a makeup bag with body spray <unk> hand sanitizer and shower <unk> in japanese cherry blossom scent and some mint <unk> lip <unk> 
 the makeup bag said she leaves a <unk> wherever she goes '' under a picture of a pink diamond 
 he remembered that japanese cherry blossom is my favorite scent from bath and body works from way back in september when i casually mentioned it during my interview 
 i feel so appreciated and welcomed 
 like he did n't have to do it but he did 
 i love my job and everyone <unk> their faces was easily the best part of the day 
 they tried to use 12 coupons and place 12 separate orders to beat the one coupon per customer rule completely oblivious to the fact there were people behind them in line 
 last time they were here they sent back the tacos they did n't pay for because we did n't cook brand new chicken <unk> just for them it takes 20 minutes to cook and this is fast food 
 then they let their kids use the dining room as a playground 
 other customers were getting pissed off at them too 
 the general manager did n't want to refuse service but you can either say yes to these fuckers and keep 3 people happy or say no and keep 10 people happy 
 edit : everyone is asking for a story and i wish i had one but they just walked out.i 've worked at the same supermarket for about five years <unk> as a cashier and recently got promoted to an assistant front end manager 
 i am generally on a closing shift this story <unk> around 10pm around the time the weirdos start wandering in and <unk> until we close 
 while i was walking the magazine racks to see if customers hid any returns in them an older customer who was loading her cart whom i have never seen before asks me are you a new manager here '' 
 this generally leads to a question 
 being the courteous person i am say not entirely new but yes ma 'm i am 
 how can i help you 
 she smiles a smile and mutters under her breath store 's really going down hill '' 
 now i am a little bit taken aback but since i am quick of wit i respond unfortunately so is our customer base '' 
 she was n't very happy with my response 
 about two years ago i was working as a cashier a pet store we always had crazy cat ladies coming in and out 
 one night just at closing a regular crazy cat lady comes in she is known for causing trouble using fraudulent coupons and just generally being an unpleasant person gets her usual stuff and comes up to my register 
 i scan and bag all the items and make small talk 
 then she grabs her cart and starts to walk out the door 
 & gt me : ma'am you forgot to pay '' 
 & gt cat lady : '' no i didnt i 'm going to put these in my car and been right back '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry ma'am you have to pay for the items before you leave '' 
 at this point my manager comes <unk> manager had been having a bad night and wasnt in the mood for crap 
 & gt manager : '' whats going on '' 
 & gt me : she wants to put her items in her car before paying '' 
 & gt cat lady : i am a customer 
 it 's my right to do that '' 
 & gt manager : '' thats considered theft either pay or leave '' & gt cat lady : fine '' 
 the cat lady then pays and leaves 
 a few days later the store gets a call from corporate 
 the woman on the line is laughing so hard she can barely speak 
 apparently someone called to complain that we would n't let them take stuff out of the store without paying <unk> a story yesterday which was fairly amusing for myself 
 but this customer today just left me confused 
 i 'm on mobile so ca n't see how the formatting has turned out but i think i did it right 
 so i 'm filling stock down the health and beauty aisle at the grocery store i work at when i hear one of those loud annoying excuse <unk> '' 's not far away from me so head over to see what i can roll my eyes at 
 from here i 'll be me and dumb lady dl 
 & gt me : hey there what can i help you with 
 & gt dl : how much is this '' 
 & gt me : all the products on the shelf have a price tag 
 is there one missing '' 
 & gt dl : yeah this '' 
 she holds up the promotional cube with brand 's '' logo on it we have on either side of the display 
 & gt me : umm that 's actually just for promotion and is owned by the company who deals with brand 's '' products so we ca n't sell or give it away '' 
 & gt dl : oh so there 's nothing inside '' 
 & gt me : no ... it 's only promotional material to make the display stand out '' 
 dl still seems confused about why she ca n't buy this <unk> cube but says ok so i leave it at that and get back to my work 
 about 20 minutes later and i 've moved to another aisle at the other end of the store and i get a call on the pa for customer assistance at one of the registers 
 i head over and see dl holding up 'product and waving it around 
 & gt dl : do you have 'product in 'other variety 
 i looked everywhere and you do n't have it '' 
 so i go grab it from the shelf where lo and behold it is in the spot directly next to the one she was holding 
 i bring it back and hand it to her 
 just as im about to walk off i see hidden behind her purse in her trolley the promotional cube thingo 
 & gt me : umm excuse me could i please have that back 
 i need it to stay on the shelf during the promotion '' 
 & gt dl : oh but you told me i could have it '' 
 i honestly do n't care whether we keep it or not but if you lie to me i 'll do everything in my power so that you do not get what you want 
 & gt me : sorry if i confused you but we need to keep that on the display as it is paid for by <unk> '' 
 she sheepishly hands it back to me and i walk of wondering why anyone would want a flimsy cardboard cube that serves no real purpose 
 tl dr : people be weird <unk> work in northern california for a <unk> luxury fashion brand 
 i 'm a stylist which means i am responsible both for ordinary <unk> work finding sizes maintaining visual standards greeting customers etc and for style appointments meaning i teach people how to dress help them pick out items to fit their needs show them what would <unk> their body type etc 
 one of my primary <unk> is to make every customer a client by demonstrating my knowledge so they take and trust my advice and will schedule future style appointments 
 ___ i 'm working a <unk> shift and in walks a <unk> year old women with her ~20 year old daughter 
 both are tall lean tanned <unk> with english accents 
 i 'm working with a client when they walk in but i say hello welcome to redacted '' and another stylist starts to talk to them 
 the daughter is roughly my age and very attractive so i am hoping that i can somehow help them 
 a few minutes go by and the mother is trying on some items while the daughter waits 
 i am making small-talk with the daughter and after a minute or two offer to get her some coffee water or juice '' as we have these available for clients free of charge and i 'm trying to <unk> myself with her 
 she says i hate to be a bother but ... '' she reaches into her handbag 
 she produces a small box which she opens 
 she reaches into the box and with careful grip produces a <unk> 
 ... could you brew some tea for me please '' 
 i do n't think this is too odd although it is distinctly english in my mind 
 i retrieve a cup for hot beverages and pour some hot water into it in our <unk> kitchen and carry it out to her 
 i warn her that it 's quite hot and that she should let it brew another minute or two 
 i go on about my work processing some items letting the other stylist take care of the pair of women 
 i go over to the fitting rooms to check on her and see her reaching into her handbag to find something else 
 at first i was worried i 'd have to go brew another tea for her having somehow <unk> the first 
 instead i witnessed the most <unk> posh and english thing i 've ever witnessed 
 a saucer and teacup were produced and the tea poured from the cardboard cup i 'd provided into the teacup from which she then gently <unk> 
 she was perfectly polite and purchased a few items and then left 
 other than brewing some tea being english and being attractive she was <unk> as a customer 
 but i 'll be damned if that is n't the most english thing i 've ever witnessed 
 <unk> deer : a customer brought her own tea and teacup into my store 
 **so it 's been a hectic day i 'm on my break and this happened a little while ago 
 this man came through my line buying two boxes of holiday cards 
 they 're on sale right now buy one get the second at 50 % off

 cl : fumbling through wallet for card hands it to me and before i have a chance to scan it it 's still not correct 
 me : i have n't scanned your card yet 
 scans card sales price goes through pays hands over bag have a nice day 
 cl : yeah 
 walks off shoot me.i used to work for a <unk> 
 or the <unk> place if you prefer 
 it was wonderful to be honest 
 it was owned and operated by a local guy who also owned another franchise that his wife ran 
 awesome people 
 it was my first job i got paid a dollar over minimum wage meals were free we could take home <unk> at the end of the day yay apple pies 
 my managers were all great people most of my coworkers were as well 
 i left on good terms at the end of my senior year of high school 
 i came back about 2 years later 
 my life was n't working out as planned so i moved back in with my parents 
 walked in one day to get something to eat and before i knew what was happening i was giving them my uniform size and starting the next day 
 i was cool with it 
 needed a job that one was like riding a bicycle quickly got back into the swing of things 
 then corporate came calling 
 they had seen the amazing profits this store in a rural area was making $ <unk> million a year in <unk> in a town that has more <unk> than people and of course they wanted in on that 
 the owners were getting older late 50s early 60s had built the stores about 14 years earlier and wanted to spend more time with their grandkids 
 they sold both stores to corporate 
 made a nice chunk of change to retire on they left on their yacht to <unk> down to the bahamas for a year or so 
 then came corporate and becky 
 she had been an agm at another store and was anxious to prove herself as a brand new general manager 
 she did n't like that employees all got free meals but the previous owners had made that a stipulation in the contract 
 she insisted that our paper costs were out of control and made a rule that drive-thru customers only got one napkin per meal ordered 
 customers complained and i directed them to becky 
 she also discontinued the store policy of free refills in the drive-thru 
 we only had about 3 regulars who took us up on the offer and they understood but did n't like it 
 we had a group of elderly gentlemen that would come in every morning 
 they all got a senior coffee and would sit and bullshit with each other for a few hours 
 bette who worked the counter in the morning would have their coffees waiting for them with the appropriate cream and <unk> by the time they got in and <unk> down their <unk> cents 
 becky made her stop 
 how do you know what they 're going to order '' 
 she asked 
 they 've come in every weekday for the past 10 years and ordered the same thing 
 that 's how i know '' bette replied 
 she was a sweet lady but did n't take shit from anyone 
 becky replied that she did n't care and if food was made before it was ordered again there would be <unk> in bette 's future 
 and things like that continued 
 no more taking home leftover apple pies that 's stealing 
 the only drinks employees were allowed to have while working were soft drinks or tap water previous owners allowed us whatever we wanted from coffee to shakes if we wanted something else we had to wait until our meal break or pay for it 
 customers noticed the changes and started not coming in as often 
 sales and profits fell 
 people started quitting even employees who had been there for years 
 i left after a few months quickly finding another job 
 becky only lasted a year and a half before corporate took a look at the numbers and decided that she was n't doing well 
 profits were cut at least in half sales were seriously down from previous years 
 corporate sold it back to an <unk> and from what i heard for considerably less than they paid for it 
 in essence becky refused to listen to the employees and managers some who had been there since the store opened as far as how the store needed to be run and insisted on doing it all the corporate way 
 from what i hear it 's still not the same as in the old days but it is considerably better than the corporate <unk> 
 i do n't post really but i had to share this experience with a customer from yesterday 
 i work at a <unk> convenience store 
 we only take cash debit and credit if it 's visa or mastercard -- nothing else 
 in walks older gentleman who whips out a discover card 
 i inform him that we only accept visa and <unk> 
 most people understand this 
 we have a sign posted on the window explaining this 
 old man is baffled 
 om : i only use discover 
 are you saying you do n't want my money 
 your store does n't want my business '' 
 me : no that 's not it at all sir 
 we just do not take discover or amex at this time however we 're working on accepting those cards in the future 
 do you have any other payment today '' 
 om : no and i wo n't be coming here again 
 you 've lost me as a customer 
 i 've just moved a few blocks away and planned to stop by daily but i think i will go to competitor who is n't breaking federal laws '' 
 yes he does shout those two words 
 me : excuse me sir '' 
 om : federal law requires that you accept all major credit cards 
 i will also be reporting you '' 
 before i could respond he <unk> out the door 
 what planet do these people fall out of hello tfr reading all your lovely stories brings back so many memories of why i got out of retail 
 people who 've never worked it just ca n't comprehend some of the things we see every day but i guess it 's like that most places 
 since you 've all been giving me flashbacks i 'll share one of my favorite personal stories from my time in the <unk> 
 it 's black friday 2003 has it been 10 years already 
 wow 
 i 'm working as a tech for a large us electronics retailer but everyone works sales '' on black friday right 
 and its right before the gates open 
 i and a few other employees that are not in the departments that will be attacked in the first wave '' have this tradition of lining up against the entrance rails the <unk> things that funnel people in of the store on bf 
 it 's kind of like watching the running of the <unk> in <unk> for us it helps you get <unk> up for what 's going to be a long day 
 so the <unk> talks have happened everyone is in place and the store manager <unk> the inner door and chains 
 everyone sort of holds their breath as the outer doors are unlocked and slid open 
 the store manager barely has time to <unk> the entrance rails before this mass of people push past us in a <unk> of greed and entitlement 
 towards the front of the pack is a woman probably mid 40 's dragging her elderly mother easily 70 or so along on her quest for cheap consumer goods 
 then like a stereotypical action movie everything suddenly slows down sounds become muffled and <unk> 
 we all see the old woman <unk> 
 we see the terror in her eyes as she trips falls to one knee and <unk> forward 
 we see her daughter look back over her shoulder at her mother now in very real danger of being <unk> 
 the daughter lets ... go ... no hesitation in her step no look of regret in her eyes 
 her head snaps forward intent on her <unk> as she <unk> back into the crowd 
 the mother drops to the ground surrounded by chaos and it reminds me of watching <unk> 
 at this point we snap back to real-time and myself two rather large security guys and the manager jump the rail and try to push the mob back through the door so we can get to the old woman 
 i end up helping get her off the floor and out of the way while the security guys play riot police and trade insults and in one case black eyes with the mob 
 we get the woman back to the store office she 's shaken and scared and a bit bloody due to a split lip and her nose <unk> the floor 
 store manager puts a call in to ems and we try to keep her calm until they arrive 
 she starts asking for her daughter afraid she might need to go to the hospital so we start <unk> overhead and i go out to try and locate her in person 
 i 'm out looking for 30 minutes or so with no luck with pages still sounding overhead as i work my way back to the office 
 the emt 's have arrived and have the woman on a gurney checking her out 
 bumps and <unk> but they think she 's fine 
 she needs to go be checked over anyways 
 she does n't want to go without her daughter so they agree to wait a bit longer 
 an hour after the fall the daughter rolls up to customer service ignoring the huge register lines with an overflowing cart of product 
 she demands that we check her out immediately so she can tend her injured mother and take her to the emergency room 
 she starts ranting immediately about how horrible we all are for caring about money more than her mother’s health 
 customer service chick is n't having it i 'm not having it manager is trying really hard not to let loose on this lady and the emt 's are just disgusted 
 before any of us can really do anything the tiny little elderly woman wrapped up in <unk> <unk> to a gurney looks her daughter square in the eyes and says <unk> you <unk> '' before turning to the emt 's with let 's roll boys '' 
 daughter freaks out at this and while her mother is being wheeled towards the entrance she grabs hold of a police officer that was standing nearby he came in with the emts <unk> demanding he do something about the situation 
 officer friendly takes one look at her and says lady i 've heard the whole thing 
 you can <unk> wait in line like everyone else 
 if you cause any more problems for these people you 'll be leaving with me 
 i own my business 
 we have an awesome pos where i can and do store customer 's names addresses and phone numbers 
 it 's a fabric and <unk> store where it is helpful to know what a customer bought previously especially when they 're asking me 
 we recently had a customer come in and tell us she 'd paid for a partially <unk> shop sample hanging on the wall and was here to pick it up 
 i have employees and had n't heard of anyone buying it but have a habit of believing my customers particularly when i know their names 
 so i pull the sample off the wall and <unk> it up 
 she stands around and chats for a minute all the while i 'm searching the computer to see if we 've got record of the transaction 
 i 'm not finding anything and she must see a bit of confusion on my face because she grabs the sample and quickly says her goodbyes 
 turns out she did n't actually pay for the sample 
 so we call her 
 she claims that one of my employees told her it was $ <unk> and she 'd given the employee $ 10 while she was just too busy to get it off the wall 
 we do n't price things at the <unk> level 
 we do n't take cash without a register transaction and we do n't sell a $ 35 dollar sample for less than $ 10 
 we tell her she needs to come into the shop and pay off the difference we 're not fighting about the $ 10 at this point 
 this has been a week ago 
 she still has n't come back 
 our options now are call the police and report the theft or tell all of her friends who shop at our store and call her church <unk> <unk> cap wearing types and ask them to pass along the message that she owes us money 
 this one is going to be fun ... a quick edit on the <unk> thing 
 there is video proof she walked out without paying and our pos has absolutely no record of any payment or purchase by her since april <unk> back then couple years ago before i changed departments and went to gas station i was a cashier at a local grocery chain 
 i had the misfortune of working christmas eve 
 luckily i worked in the morning and was out by 12:00 noon 
 i 'm working the till and that christmas eve morning it was actually raining and cold 
 no snow 
 it does n't snow where i live i was near the exit so would constantly get a breeze of cold wet air 
 i had been working the past 4 days so i could get the following week off and be able to hang out new year 's eve 
 things were going smooth when i had my first difficult customer of the day 
 snobby lady we will call her 
 me : hello find everything alright 
 snobby lady : yes 
 yes i did 
 it 's nice and cold outside but i 'm not liking the rain 
 me : yes it is 
 and me either 
 hopefully it does n't rain tomorrow on christmas day 
 snobby lady : i know 
 i 'm going to come early to get some more things for lunch and dinner for my family tomorrow 
 now just a note 
 we are closed christmas day 
 we always have been 
 we have signs on every single cash register stating we are closed and will open the next day me : oh well you should get those items right now or later today 
 we are going to be closed tomorrow 
 it 's christmas day 
 snobby lady : oh no i 'll just come tomorrow me : ma'am 
 we are closed tomorrow snobby lady : what do you mean your closed tomorrow 
 it 's christmas day 
 i have things i need to buy 
 me : and i have a family i 'd like to be at home with and spend my day with 
 if you have things you need to buy do so now 
 snobby lady : i need to speak to your manager now 
 at this point i was like great 
 i should n't have said that '' 
 my manager shows up to speak to her 
 manager : yes ma'am 
 how can i help you 
 snobby lady : your employee unrealdude03 '' while looking at my name tag said you are closed tomorrow 
 i demand this store be open 
 i have things to buy and i am the customer 
 manager : i 'm sorry ma'am but we have signs posted all over the store stating we are closed and the signs have been up for over 2 weeks now 
 i suggest you buy what you need now 
 she was quite taken back at this response snobby lady : i know insert main store managers name here and i will make sure you and unrealdude03 '' will get fired for turning away a customer 
 manager : if you would like to speak to him he is actually right there point in direction snobby lady : i will 
 enjoy being <unk> on christmas 
 she left and went immediately to speak to him 
 he paid little to no attention to her and asked her to leave his store if she was going to continue to harass him and his employees 
 that main manager has probably never stood up for his employees 
 he usually does what the customers want even though it 's against corporate policy 
 i was working in the garden center of my store again yesterday stuck all alone in my cube with a long line of customers and no backup cashiers 
 a guy that is at least 45 years old comes up with a bunch of wall blocks <unk> <unk> and some other odds and ends 
 i ring everything up and tell him his total 
 he 'll be big baby bb for short 
 & gt me : okay that 'll be $ $ $ $ 
 & gt bb : hang on i forgot something 
 he leaves his flatbed cart at my register blocking other customers from entering and exiting the garden center and blocking me from entering and exiting my cube 
 i climb over his cart and push it out of the way with all my might 
 i finally get it moved behind the closed registers and continue helping people 
 a group of old ladies lined up at the closed register and i told them to come over to my line as i was the only person out there 
 i ring one of them out and bb comes back up and cuts in front of the next old lady 
 & gt bb : okay i 'm ready 
 *shoves weed tarp in my face while i 'm talking to the next lady in line* & gt me : okay she 's next 
 she has been waiting for twenty minutes and has <unk> that her legs are tired and that she just wants to pay for her stuff and go out with her friends 
 & gt bb : well i was here first i 'm ready now 
 i just needed to get this one thing 
 & gt me : you left the line to get that one thing 
 i 'm not going to start ringing up people out of order 
 she has waited in line like everyone else 
 i will ring you up when i 'm done with these guys 
 there were two people before bb in line but he decides to go sit on his flatbed cart and pout 
 i finish helping the two remaining customers and wait for him to come over to me 
 he wo n't 
 more people line up so i ring them out 
 this continues for about half an hour 
 another old lady comes up and comments about how bb has been sitting on his cart for a while and asks him if he would like to go in front of her 
 & gt me to bb : are you ready to check out now 
 i can help you over here 
 & gt bb with <unk> attitude : i 've been ready for a while now but you wo n't help me 
 & gt me in the most <unk> : if you bring your stuff over i can help you over here 
 so bb acts like this is a great deal and makes a show out of bringing all of his stuff over 
 i had suspended the original transaction so all i had to do was scan the one item he went to get and he could pay and be on his way 
 i scan the one thing and he says i 've got to be kidding him '' when i say i only needed to scan that one item 
 he pays and finally leaves 
 & gt me to the old lady in line behind him : i was n't ignoring him he was acting like a baby because i would n't let him cut in line earlier 
 he has been sitting there for half an hour refusing to let me ring him out 
 & gt old lady : wow i knew he was sitting there a long time but i did n't think he was just being a little sh*t. <unk> 
 edit : i made it to the <unk> link <unk> 
 dreams do come <unk> i was stocking dog biscuits at the pet retailer where i worked for three years 
 an elderly woman and her daughter approached and i greeted them and asked if i could help with anything 
 they declined so i went back to stocking the dog biscuits 
 out of no where the elderly woman reached across me to grab a bag of treats from a <unk> shelf 
 as she brought the treats down from the shelf she brought her elbow straight into my face 
 now 
 she did n't hit me hard enough to do any real damage but an elbow to the face will cause anyone to react right 
 i mean 
 i kind of teared up and the woman 's daughter kind of <unk> out 
 mom '' 
 she said 
 you should apologize '' 
 the old woman 's response 
 but why 
 she works here 
 another annoyance from the gift shop 
 as mentioned in my other posts we also sell lotto tickets 
 this was some time last year and there is a huge <unk> on that night so naturally i 'm flat out 
 there is a constant line about 8 people long and i 'm going as fast as i can while remaining pleasant 
 now some people come in with their card that has their favourite numbers saved on it and many of these will have multiple tickets one for each day or whatever 
 while their tickets print i usually make some small talk about the weather or ask what 's on for the weekend etc 
 as i 'm going through customers i notice a lady huffing and puffing rolling her eyes i 'm sure you know the kind 
 she 's all dressed up short dress open <unk> shoes and it is cold out 
 i live in a fairly rural town and usually only see people dressed like this in the middle of the night for clubbing or when the horse <unk> are on so i 'm a bit confused as to why the hell she insists of freezing herself 
 anyway i 'm serving a regular lady and have a bit of a chat while her tickets print and i have her sorted in about 1 minute 
 so now i 'm up to miss <unk> hp 
 hp : you realize that if you did n't talk so much the line would go faster 
 i 'm <unk> and you are making me stand in line 
 me : wondering why the hell she is n't wearing a jacket and scarf like everyone else i just like to be friendly while things are printing so we are n't just standing in silence is all what would you like 
 so as her tickets print i ask how she is and she just gives me this glare and ignores me so i try not to roll my eyes 
 as she goes to leave i glance at the screen again before clearing it for the next person and realize i 've short changed her $ 1 
 me : just a second 
 sorry i <unk> you by a dollar 
 i smile and hold out the coin for her hp : snatches the coin and <unk> me a bit with her nails heaves a big sigh all the service in this town is <unk> all you <unk> have *no <unk> how to treat people 
 in big city mistakes like this just *do n't <unk> 
 whatever i just ignore her completely i have the freedom from my <unk> where i do n't have to take shit and go to the next in line remaining my cheery self while hp starts crapping on about how great the city is in <unk> and i internally start hoping she chokes on the <unk> 
 i 'm just thinking about telling her to please leave when one of my regulars i guess him to be 19-20 mumbles loudly oh my god <unk> <unk> '' 
 everyone hears him and i try not to <unk> laughter which is hard since the guy i 'm currently serving is shaking with silent giggles 
 hp : you people are absolutely *appalling* 
 no respect whatsoever 
 young regular guy then says what 
 you want us all to kiss your rings <unk> you 're from big city or something '' 
 she clip <unk> angrily out of the shop and into the rain while everyone cracks up laughing 
 **tl : dr lady thinks we should kneel before her mighty high heels 
 ****background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven 
 **story : ** i think this week i 'm going to focus on stories about people who try to scam me 
 they rarely get away with it but that sure does n't stop them from trying 
 we had two customers that came into the store and announced to the cashier that they were looking to spend around $ 1000 and wanted to pick up a lot of fireworks 
 my dad greeted them and offered to show them around 
 dad went through the spiel and started showing them videos and helping them out 
 the entire time these two were trying to work a better deal 
 i know most people don’t try to haggle when shopping at their local target store but hey i get it it 's a fireworks tent and the truth is we usually are willing to haggle a bit especially if you’re picking up a lot of stuff 
 these guys definitely took it to the next level 
 my dad is one of the nicest people you 'll ever meet but this type of thing wears on him pretty fast especially when someone is obviously going over the top 
 it’s one thing to offer a lower amount for an item but when you start criticizing the products or my store my dad is going to quickly lose interest in helping you 
 after about 30 minutes of this i could see dad was pretty much over these guys so i walked up and told them that if they were going to pick up a lot of stuff we would just give them 20 % off their total order 
 they immediately <unk> that that wasn’t good enough but i was pretty firm 
 i already know that i’m cheaper than anyone else and 20 % is a <unk> discount 
 hell the only reason i did 20 % is because my dad was tired of dealing with them and i wanted to get them out of the store 
 the guys finish picking out their stuff and go to check out 
 they fill out the liability waiver and the cashier starts to ring in their stuff 
 after the cashier rings in their purchase she waves me down and i walked over to the counter to see what the issue was 
 tweedle <unk> and tweedle <unk> <unk> were trying to pay with two $ 500 gift certificates 
 now i give away a lot of gift certificates on the radio and during sales promotions 
 the thing is i only give away $ 50 gift certificates 
 these two idiots have obviously <unk> and altered a real gift certificate and are trying to pass it off 
 now i’m pissed 
 **me : ** this is the worst <unk> i’ve ever seen 
 you guys are idiots 
 **td1 : ** i won those on the radio 
 they’re real 
 **me : ** my gift certificates are printed on custom paper and i only issue $ 50 gift certificates 
 these are colored scans of a gift certificate and they’re not real 
 **td1 : ** yes they are 
 <unk> : ** besides if you’re gift certificates don’t say no <unk> on them you can make copies 
 **me : ** yeah that’s not what the law says 
 what the law does say is that you’re guilty of 3rd degree felony theft for trying to steal $ 1300 of fireworks their amount before the 20 % discount 
 **td1 : ** we didn’t try to steal anything 
 **me : ** you attempted to pay with a forged document 
 it’s the same as if you used a stolen credit card 
 i have your name address and multiple witnesses and i fully intent to press charges 
 you guys can stay until the cops arrive or they can arrest you at home doesn’t matter to me 
 **td1 : ** that’s not real 
 we didn’t steal anything 
 **me : ** oh because the last two times this has happened at my store never actually happened before the people were arrested and convicted of theft 
 i guess we’ll let the police sort it out 
 if you can’t pay for the fireworks it’s theft 
 <unk> and <unk> start an intense negotiation between themselves that involves more than a little shouting at each other 
 after a while they insist that i’m wrong but they’re willing to pay with a credit card just to be done with it 
 they’re trying to figure out how to split up the $ 1000 when i informed them that the total was $ 1300 
 there’s no way in hell i was giving them a 20 % discount after they tried to scam me 
 in the end they only paid for and received around $ 600 of fireworks and they had to split the charges over four credit cards between them to do that 
 we were very careful with the <unk> and i made the cashier copy down their driver’s license numbers just in case they tried to dispute the charges 
 to be honest i would have just let them leave if they had tried 
 it 's not really worth my time or effort to press it and i was actually just making it up as i went along because they pissed me off 
 they definitely didn’t leave happy 
 my dad couldn’t resist when they were walking out 
 **dad : ** you <unk> come back and see us again next year 
 they haven’t been back 
 -- -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here tl dr : cart not cat 
 so at my store popular west coast electronics store we have carts filled with open box '' discounted merchandise 
 last night i helped a customer with an item and put it in his shopping cart 
 a few minutes later i see him come back to my area and browse through the open box cart 
 i turned my attention elsewhere for a few minutes and when i turned back to the open box cart it was gone and the cart with his one <unk> <unk> item was still there 
 i look around and see him browsing the aisles with the open box cart signs and all 
 after a couple of minutes he looks down at his cart and looks really confused 
 he then walks back put the open box cart back and grabs his cart 
 funniest thing i 've seen in a long <unk> mobile so excuse my formatting this just happened earlier today 
 i work for a cell phone company 
 a lady came in wanting to add 3 new lines of service to her account 
 she picked out our most expensive higher end cell phones 
 immediately red flags went off in my head 
 firstly the account was based in another state 
 secondly she really did n't seem concerned with <unk> cost 
 she had an id that matched the account holders name but i was feeling really suspicious 
 i let my manager know my concern so he joined me at the table and started asking her questions like what brings her into town etc etc 
 she suddenly says she needs to run some errands and can she come back 
 we say sure 
 after she leaves i called the number on the account and got a hold of the account holder who confirmed she was n't in my store and is in fact in another state 
 at that point we confirmed it was fraud and contacted the police 
 the <unk> actually called back and asked if her phones were done yet 
 i told her 15 minutes and she could pick them up 
 she ended up not coming back 
 not sure if she saw the cop car even though we told him to park in the back and got spooked 
 either way it was a satisfying feeling to stop someone from committing fraud and hopefully getting her busted in the future this happened on christmas eve 
 i was having a very long day and i was exhausted 
 this young couple walked in and the guy asked for number candles for his grandmother 's birthday cake 
 me : which numbers would you like 
 him : two ones and a zero 
 me : wow is she 110 years old 
 him : haha <unk> 
 110 
 me : that 's incredible 
 him : hey you think that 's a lot 
 she 's healthy as a horse 
 me : is n't it 
 i hope she stays strong and healthy 
 i was honestly surprised but as they were walking out i saw them laughing at each other 
 and that 's when i realised my mistake 
 today he came back for something else 
 me : so she 's 101 is n't she 
 him : haha yes you remember 
 me : still a lot by the way 
 i guess he was nice about it but i kinda felt bad about the other day 
 they did laugh with my <unk> after all 
 edit : thank you guys for saying that i was n't stupid : di work for a major furniture retailer 
 one night i we had a large family come in late and hold us up putting together a large order for delivery 
 they were in the store a full hour after close and that was 45 minutes after the <unk> customer left 
 we got the order together and it went out for delivery the next day 
 because of the self-serve nature of our business we charge a small fee for the getting-stuff-together '' part and a separate small fee for delivery 
 together they add up to about $ 100 
 we have paperwork you have to sign <unk> those fees making sure you understand them 
 you go home with a copy of said <unk> family 's order was roughly $ <unk> with those fees included 
 the next day before the delivery took place a man comes in 
 he had not been there the previous night but had the last customer 's paperwork 
 he is the brother of the <unk> member of that party 
 he is very upset at the getting-stuff-together '' fee 
 we explain it to him and he is still upset 
 he wants it refunded and demands the refund or he will return everything 
 we tell him we can return everything even the delivery fee but not the getting-stuff-together '' fee since that service has been performed already 
 he accuses us of theft and said he will call the cops 
 we tell him our hands are tied we can not refund for a service already performed but he is not having any 
 he <unk> off and calls 911 
 *60 seconds <unk> an officer comes through the door 
 he must have been in our parking lot when the call came in 
 he is very upset 
 the customer '' explains the situation and the cop reads him the riot act for calling 911 over a civil matter 
 the guy gets upset and says i ca n't believe you are talking to me this way '' 
 more officers arrive 
 the first officer explains again and also explains that if we wanted to we could ask the officers to <unk> a trespass warning to the customer '' and if he shows his face in our store again he 'll be arrested 
 the customer '' changes his tune 
 he wants the delivery but we will be hearing from his lawyer about the getting-stuff-together '' fee 
 he leaves the officers joke about calling off the <unk> team and the <unk> and all 5 of them leave.sorry for posting again so soon but i could n't get this one out of my head so i feel obligated to share it 
 this incident takes place during my summer position at a gas station 
 all employees wore headsets so we would n't have to yell from across the store 
 from the moment this guy walked in i could tell he was having a bad day 
 he impatiently waits in line 
 when he makes it to the counter he starts speaking and suddenly there came a fairly loud conversation taking place over the headsets 
 taking the earpiece out i apologize 
 i 'm sorry sir what was that '' 
 apparently that meant i was deaf and stupid 
 coolant 
 <unk> where is it '' 
 oh i 'm sorry it 's right down this first aisle here on the bottom shelf '' 
 he storms off and picks one up brings it up and drops it on the counter 
 i quietly ring it up and tell him his total 
 he opened his wallet and a very audible fuck '' 
 <unk> through the store 
 i hope i have enough in my damn bank account '' 
 he swipes his card it goes through 
 he snatches the coolant and heads out to his car 
 it was only then i noticed the hood was <unk> up and a twenty something girl was sitting in the passenger seat crying 
 i keep my attention on the guy as there were no other customers at that moment 
 he makes an attempt to pour the coolant in and misses getting it everywhere except where it needed to be 
 i ca n't hear him but i can see his mouth go through the motion of that famous word again ... several times 
 he comes back in 
 can i get a funnel and some paper towels '' 
 it took a few seconds as i was turning around i swore i heard please '' 
 no surely not 
 absolutely did you need any help out there '' 
 i say as i hand him a small stack of towels and a funnel 
 this guy was shaking so much in <unk> he was about to break 
 no i should be able to get it this time 
 thanks though '' 
 wait ... what 
 fast forward to a few minutes later he comes in to wash his hands 
 i figured he 'd just leave afterwards 
 nope 
 he stood in line again this time less anxiously 
 he reaches the counter again and sighs 
 i 'm sorry for being short with you 
 i had to drive all the way to the other side of the state to get my daughter and her stuff from her asshole boyfriend 's apartment 
 my car is <unk> and i spent everything i had getting over there and back '' 
 i carry on speaking with him for a few minutes about how her boyfriend must have been a major <unk> and directing him to an auto shop down the road that did quick free <unk> 
 by the time he left he had a smile on his face and a freezy drink in each hand because i felt bad and had extra coupons 
 everything is better with freezies 
 not a bad day 
 **tl dr <unk> guy starts out as a jerk slowly turns into a decent guy and apologizes for being a jerk 
 also freezies make the world a better place 
 *edit* because i suck at <unk> 'll start from the beginning 
 i started working for x store in october 
 i was friendly with the manager he knew my situation and was completely understanding a truly amazing guy 
 he knew my husband was military and there was a small possibility we 'd move back to our home state in <unk> when my husband gets out if he ca n't find a job my paycheck at x store would n't cover any bills let alone rent 
 he was fine with it all even offered to help me if it came down to that and put in a transfer request 
 fast forward to about 3 weeks ago 
 the manager who hired me passed away may he rest in peace an assistant was promoted to manager leaving a position open 
 i was passed up for it because the cashier we recently hired and been an assistant with x store before and she is an extremely awesome person so i was fine with it 
 when the new manager was explaining that i was next in line for promotion we got to talking casually about my vehicle finally being repaired so i did n't have to walk to work etc 
 the following conversation made me see <unk> me : '' yeah i 'm happy about it 
 now we are putting the rest back in savings just in case the move does have to happen '' 
 nm- '' move 
 you 're moving '' 
 me- '' well it 's a big if kind of thing 
 we really want to stay here in insert state here because we love the weather but if my husband ca n't find work after he gets out of the military we 'll have to move back to our home state for financial security '' 
 nm- '' ... you 're military affiliated 
 wow you 're lucky 
 i would n't have hired you then 
 i never hire military they are completely unreliable '' 
 this being said after i 've worked numerous doubles to cover co-workers shifts offered to switch shifts for co-workers when they needed it etc well you can forget what i said about any promotion 
 you 'd just be a complete wasted <unk> for me '' 
 me- wait really '' 
 at first i thought she was joking nm- '' yeah i would n't have said it if i did n't mean it ... '' at that point i still had about 20 minutes before i had to clock in so i step outside to calm down 
 i was furious why work for a company when you know you wo n't move forward ... i called my mother in law and spoke to her about it she suggested i contact hr and go from there 
 so i walk back in and nm is just trash talking me for being military affiliated and now suddenly unreliable to the cashier who was just promoted 
 i was so upset at that point i did n't want to work with her because i would 've lost my job 
 i spoke to my awesome co-worker about it and she agreed to cover my shift she could tell i was pretty upset i was on the verge of tears 
 that night i emailed hr contacted our district manager and spoke to him about it all 
 few days later he comes into the store and pulls me aside 
 nm claimed she was joking and laughed when she stated those things to me so she did n't get in any sort of trouble 
 the district manager then told me that our previous manager had <unk> me up that he wanted to see me training for a supervisor position in the next week 
 good news i am now officially training for the promotion i 'll be receiving next week 
 wish my old manager could be here for it 
 bad news the promotion is because my awesome co-worker is being transferred to a new store opening up a few towns away = so going to miss her but happy she 's getting to be <unk> at a new store = first time post 
 apologies if i 'm too <unk> 
 back in high school i worked for a coffee chain 
 let 's call it <unk> 
 we had all sorts of customers and a few good regulars but one of our regular <unk> was the elderly 
 we were located very close to a pair of <unk> living homes and were in a community that 's 97 % white and whose average home value was $ 900,000 so we had quite a few <unk> and grandpas coming in 
 one trend i noticed was that the old-timers would often want their drinks hot 
 they would almost never order cold drinks and they would request that their lattes be extra hot 
 we 'd often be asked to microwave drip coffees because 170 degrees ostensibly was n't hot enough for them 
 so one day a little old lady comes up and asks for a zen tea extra hot 
 no problem my coworker rings her up while i make the tea 
 on our coffee maker there 's a hot water spout 
 you know those red <unk> that dispense water 
 well in case you did n't know that water is at an off-boil ~205 degrees 
 it 's hot enough that you ca n't hold the bare cup whilst filling it <unk> you burn your hand 
 to make tea you simply grab a cup drop in the tea bag fill it with the water top it and serve it 
 i do steps 1-3 but while trying to put on the top the wall of the cup caves inward and sends 190-200 degree water all over my arms and hands 
 this is n't the first burn i 've had working there so i dutifully remade the drink immediately 
 i hand the lady her new cup of tea and apologize for the <unk> 
 she takes a sip frowns and asks if we can make it any hotter 
 i look at her down at the <unk> forming on my hands then back at her 
 *forced smile* no ma'am 
 that 's as hot as it gets '' 
 tl dr : found a severed human finger in the mocha mix served it to hundreds of customers <unk> it 's the six day streak of eight hour shifts but either my tolerance for rudeness has gone down or something in the air has made customers ruder 
 any who it does remind me of this incident a few months ago 
 so we 're a smaller version of big uk supermarket chain but one nevertheless 
 i get people haggling prices all the time even one women who argued because it was cheaper than she initially thought 
 if you wan na haggle go to a market 
 it 's quiet and i 'm sweeping up near till when the <unk> noise of self scans go off telling me to verify the weight of items on the scale 
 no biggie happens a lot customers put their own bags on them or even so much as look at it funny and it freaks out 
 i go over to the guy with a look on his face i can only describe as i do n't have time for this '' and see what 's up he does n't want the apples he scanned sighing over how produce is expensive 
 okay i go to cancel them as i do so and go to put them back he grabs my wrist 
 mistake one i may be a retail lapdog but you do n't touch me especially to grab 
 then he comes out with this gem 
 why do n't you just put them in my bag '' confused i scan them back in 
 wait i do n't want to pay for them but i want them '' 
 now it 's <unk> on me but i hang tight to <unk> 
 sorry sir '' i say but i ca n't just give things away that 's theft i 'll get fired '' he sighs loudly again almost <unk> 
 but produce is expensive no one will know come on just give them to me '' 
 now i 'm pissed 
 my job is not worth losing because you do n't want to pay £2 for apples 
 i repeat one last time for emphasis 
 sir i can not do that if you do n't want to pay the prices i 'm sure there is a green grocer that has cheaper apples 
 but i 'm not letting you walk out with something you have n't paid for '' 
 i cancel it grab the apples and keep a close eye until he pays and leaves 
 on the way out having the balls to say he 'll complain 
 good you do that i 'd really like to hear how it 's an <unk> i would n't let you leave with things you have n't paid for 
 sheesh 
 i work with children a lot as a photographer as a portrait studio and one of my favorite <unk> is 1 year old cake destruction shots 
 this mom bring in her little girl and tell me that she 's looking for some normal photos and then she 's going to change her into a tutu and wings and tiara for her cake destruction photos 
 pretty standard thing for me really 
 so the session is going pretty normally for the first 20 minutes then i tell her we can change her for the cake shots 
 mom gets her all dressed up while i pull down the easy to clean white backdrop 
 the little girl looks <unk> adorable and mom can not stop laughing at how it 's just hit her that she just became one of those '' moms who dress their kids up like this 
 just holding her daughter and cracking up looking at her 
 i love this lady 
 we set her daughter down on the backdrop floor and put the cake in front of her 
 she just stares at it and i get a couple cute photos like that and i tell mom to show her it 's ok by putting her hand into the frosting and cake and then her daughter 's hand into it 
 mom does it and the little girl laughs then mom puts her hand in and she looks shocked for a second eats a little bit and then <unk> out crying 
 just wailing 
 i take a few shots any way because this may be as good as it gets 
 but that 's when it gets good bad 
 her daughter then tries to get up and get away from it but the poor things does n't know where to crawl away she has n't started walking yet on her own and pushes her hands really far into the cake for stability 
 which normally is adorable but she 's <unk> now 
 i 'm still shooting away because i 'm a crazy person apparently but mom 's not helping her either 
 she eventually realizes she ca n't crawl away because now it 's surrounding her when this determined look takes over her face 
 her daughter pushes all the way down on the cake reaching the floor and stands up 
 mom is <unk> and saying good job and it grabs her daughters attention and her daughter 's hatred of being dirty from the cake has her reaching out making grabbing motions at mom who 's sitting next to me 
 mom makes the motions back thinking she 's just <unk> her standing on her own and then it happens 
 her daughter started walking towards her 
 for the first time ever on her own 
 the pure hatred of having dirty hands and feet from cake has <unk> this little girl to walk for the first time 
 and you can bet your butt that i started shooting like a mad man 
 moving around in different angles as fast as i could to get as many shots as possible of her first walk 
 she eventually makes it to mom who 's nearly in tears from pride and laughter of the situation and <unk> onto mom covering her in frosting as well 
 at that point my time is up and mom and i are just laughing so hard we can barely breathe 
 mom <unk> her daughter up in the bathroom and i clean up the cake and frosting from the backdrop 
 i edit the photos and make a few <unk> of her first time walking and a number of birthday card examples of her bawling her eyes out looking like <unk> smashing cake city 
 i sit mom down to <unk> the photos and she has doubled over at the ridiculous photos of her daughter 's first walk 
 her daughter in a fairy costume and tiara covered in cake bawling her eyes out walking for the first time 
 she bought the whole set 
 the best part she came back at the christmas season and brought me a present 
 a little cupcake with a candy camera in the frosting 
 she told me that all of her family is in love with the photos and that her husband was so happy that he did n't have to miss out of photos of his daughter 's first steps and that the ridiculousness of the photos made it <unk> i was a customer in this shop 
 it is a small sub shop owned by really cool guy who is a really good cook 
 there was this really mean customer who was complaining that after she finished her sub it was horrible and wanted a complete refund 
 also my apolologies on formatting i 'm using a phone 
 at this point she calls the owner an asshole tells him that his food sucks and continues to demand her money back 
 without even blinking the owner looks at her opens the register takes out a 20 and then says 
 you have bought and eaten your sandwich making satisfied noises while you were eating the sandwich and if you 're going to be like this i do n't want you as a customer to show how little i care this is the 20 you gave me a few minutes ago '' 
 he then tears the $ 20 bill into little pieces smiling and then said get the fuck out '' this guy will continue to have my <unk> 
 apologies for poor format and story telling 
 i work for a large health and beauty pharmacy chain 
 also includes a photo department which we call the lab 
 this story takes place a couple years ago when i was first being <unk> trained 
 we have ll lab lady who was training me 
 she was leaving for a break and i assured her i could run it fine on my own 
 she then points to a lady in the corner on one of the kiosks and tells me she may need my help 
 5 minutes after ll leaves i hear oh <unk> i need your help '' 
 okay obviously ll told her my name 
 i 'll refer to this lady as sw strange woman 
 sw : please help me i 'm not sure how to choose a photo 
 as i go to demonstrate selecting a photo i notice that all the photos displayed are of her boobs 
 sw : whoops 
 <unk> how embarrassing 
 at this point i realise her <unk> is one that she <unk> her <unk> more forward than normal 
 weird 
 on screen some of the photos are upside down 
 sw : oh no 
 will they print upside down 
 me : uh 
 you can then physically turn the picture round 
 i <unk> she <unk> the ones she wants bearing in mind all the pictures are almost identical same angle same lighting no creativity 
 then asks me to show her how to scroll through 
 so i show her how as i go down through the photos they also go down 
 no joke she had the flash on on her lady parts 
 i could see her insides 
 all on the screen 
 i do n't know how i kept my composure 
 this woman was slightly strange and i think she enjoyed watching me cope with the situation 
 they were n't exactly <unk> pictures but whatever 
 later ll comes back smirking at me 
 she knew this woman as a regular and knew exactly what she was going to put me through and it was hilarious 
 edit : i think i should clarify some things 
 i still work in the lab 
 the lady has never returned 
 it was unpleasant but she was n't doing anything illegal just strange 
 i did check with ll for clarification on the rules 
 this woman had some sort of mental disability i ca n't say for sure but when i am in charge of the lab it is my discretion how to handle these situations 
 i made a decision to help her quickly so she could leave quicker 
 all it is now is an interesting story 
 it 's awful that it may have had a different result if she was male but i ca n't <unk> on that either 
 interesting comments though thanks i used to work at a cake place that sold personal size cakes in little containers 
 one day when a lady orders one and i hand it to her she <unk> it and complains that it 's way too small 
 she demands i go to the back and get another one 
 i take the cake go behind the doors to the back wait 30 seconds and come back out with the same cake 
 is this one better '' 
 she looks at it very closely for a few seconds 
 yes much better thank you so much 
 you have to buy an entire extra unit before you get a free one 
 glad we all understand that 
 it 's a shame that customers do n't 
 so my store runs b2g1f 
 i can understand how the wording can be a bit ambiguous if you ca n't think for yourself sorry this sale brings out the worst in me 
 so this lady c comes up to my counter holding two <unk> of thread 
 & gt me : just the threads was it mate '' 
 & gt c : yes please '' 
 & gt me : it 's b2g1f at the moment so you can get a free thread if you like '' 
 & gt c : yes '' 
 the till has just <unk> up so i turn to log myself in and ring her items up 
 when i turn back to her : & gt me : did you grab a free one '' 
 & gt c : yes '' 
 & gt me : waits a second for her to hand it to me she just stands there okay i 'll just have to grab it so i can scan it for you '' 
 & gt c : you 've already scanned it '' 
 & gt me : no mate i 've just scanned these two '' 
 & gt c : you do n't understand your own fucking sale do you '' 
 *reaches over the counter and snatches the threads out of my hand* it 's buy two '' *holds up both threads* and get one free '' *holds up one of the two threads* & gt me : <unk> up some packets of <unk> that are on the counter* no mate 
 it 's buy two '' *holds up two packets of needles* and get one free '' *holds up third packet of needles* 
 what you 've got there would be buy 1 get 1 free which is not the sale we 're running '' 
 & gt c : <unk> well why do n't you buy two and shove them up your arse '' 
 she then threw the threads at me and stormed out 
 wtf 
 _______________________________________________________ another quick one also b2g1f 
 it 's the only sale during which a customer will tell you how many units they want to pay for instead of how many they want why 
 just why 
 a <unk> customer who is a total bitch tb comes up to the counter with some fabric 
 & gt me : how many metres would you like mate '' 
 & gt tb : two '' 
 i 'm the first to admit that i can be very petty about this sale especially after three weeks of explaining the damn thing to people 
 i cut two metres from the roll and put it to the side while i grab her next roll 
 & gt tb : how many metres was that '' 
 & gt me : two '' 
 & gt tb : what about my free <unk> '' 
 & gt me : you said you wanted two metres 
 i 've given you two '' 
 & gt tb : i only want to pay for two metres 
 i want three altogether '' 
 & gt me : ah but that was n't what i asked 
 i asked how many metres you 'd like not how many you 'd like to pay for '' 
 & gt tb : <unk> alright fine 
 can i get three metres of that one '' 
 & gt me : absolutely '' 
 *retail smile* **tl dr if you ca n't understand buy amount get amount free shop somewhere else 
 ** <unk> *edit* i 've noticed a lot of comments about my attitude and i wanted to clarify 
 this sale has been on for three weeks and i wrote this directly after coming home which is why i sound so cranky : p with the first customer we were both being perfectly pleasant with each other up until the point where she swore at me then at that point all bets were off 
 i do n't care what the sale is you do n't talk to me like that 
 with the second customer granted i could have handled the situation better 
 but for context when this woman has come in in the past and this is n't just with me but other coworkers as well she 's asked for 6 of something 
 i 've given her 6 pay for 4 get 2 free right 
 and then she claimed she wanted to pay for six and get another 3 free 
 but then other times she 's come in she 's said she 's wanted 6 and did actually want 6 but my coworker based on previous experience serving her believed she wanted to pay for 6 and so gave her a total of 9 and the customer threw a fit about it 
 with the <unk> majority of customers i 'm perfectly polite about explaining the sale because i agree that the wording could be ambiguous but this woman damn well knows how it works and just tries to make things as difficult as <unk> i work at a small <unk> stationary store 
 yesterday i had two ethnicity stereotypically known for haggling over everything customers douche1 douche2 come in with packages of latex balloons they wanted inflated 50 in all 
 this is a rare occurrence 99 % of the time the customers buy and inflate the balloons in-store 
 they go up to the only other employee a girl k that 's somewhat new and still a little shaky on the more advanced parts of the job 
 i 'm over on the lotto station and the two stations are on opposite ends of a somewhat long counter 
 the ear i 'm deaf in is facing that end so i have pretty much no idea what 's going on until i hear : k : <unk> do we inflate balloons '' 
 me : yeah the price sheet is on the wall by the tank '' 
 it 's a pretty <unk> sheet but there are different prices for just the balloon just the helium or whether it 's mylar latex or one of those <unk> balloons yadda yadda 
 k apparently read the number for buying just a latex balloon 60¢ as opposed to <unk> a balloon 85¢ and quoted that number 
 douches : oh you can do better than that '' 
 *blank stare* k has no fucking idea what to do so she calls me over 
 i still have no idea what 's going on 
 i send her to the lotto station to take care of the line that 's forming as four of our regular heavy players all decided to come in at once 
 me : okay so what 's going on here '' 
 douche2 : we wanted to inflate these balloons they say ... carefully looks over the packages helium balloons ... helium balloons ... helium balloons 
 they 're all helium balloons 
 can you inflate them '' 
 me : yes '' 
 douche2 : with helium '' 
 me : ... yeah that 's all they really use to inflate balloons 
 it 's 85¢ per balloon '' 
 douche1 : she said 60¢ apiece '' 
 me : did she 
 looks at the sheet to <unk> oh i think she must have accidentally read the price for just the balloon 
 it 's 85¢ to inflate '' 
 douche1 : but she said 60¢ '' 
 now if they had initially agreed to 60¢ when k said it they would 've paid gotten inflated and left probably without me ever noticing 
 even if i did notice i would 've honored the price they paid and done the job i would 've just spoken to k afterwards 
 but they declined the 60¢ offer and now it 's off the table 
 me : i 'm sorry she <unk> 
 it 's 85¢ to inflate '' 
 douche1 : oh you can do better than that '' 
 given that they did n't know what kind of gas goes into a balloon 5 minutes ago i assumed that statement was n't based on any kind of knowledge about the helium market so time for some education 
 me : i really ca n't actually 
 there 's a helium shortage true and the gas costs us far more than the balloons themselves 
 true there 's also labor because this is going to take us upwards of half an hour to do 
 true if you 're going to do 50 i guess i can price-break 15 % the same deal we do for a dozen balloons but that 's it '' 
 d1 : what does that come out to '' 
 me : $ 36 and change i 'll even round it down to $ 35 '' 
 if there 's one thing i 'm good at it 's mental math 
 d1 : are you sure that 's right '' 
 me : ... yes '' 
 d2 : can you check on a calculator '' 
 i give the baby his bottle and punch the numbers into a calculator with douche1 <unk> his neck over the counter to look at the screen 
 lo and behold it comes to $ 36.125 
 me : yeah $ <unk> and like i said i 'll go down to $ 35 but that 's the absolute lowest i can go '' 
 d2 : what does that come to per balloon '' 
 me : <unk> apiece '' 
 d1 : are you sure '' 
 me : puts calculator away yes '' 
 d2 : chain does it for 40¢ apiece '' 
 i 'm well-versed in our competitor 's prices and last i heard it was <unk> 
 but who knows maybe they decided they did n't like making money anymore 
 me : if that 's what they 're offering than i suggest you go there 
 we ca n't go any lower than $ 35 for everything '' 
 d2 : they 're all the way in neighboring town 
 we do n't have time to go there 
 this is for a party in an hour '' 
 oh good one of these people 
 <unk> planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part 
 me : i 'm sorry but that 's our final price '' 
 d1 : get the manager '' 
 me : i am the manager '' 
 somewhat true we do n't really have titles but i 'm definitely <unk> above most of the other employees in terms of authority 
 d1 : then the owner get him '' 
 me : <unk> next door at clothing store <unk> be back in a bit '' 
 d1 : can you call him '' 
 me : yeah i 'll call *her* '' 
 i call her she does n't answer i leave a message 
 i find out later that she left her phone in her office 
 me : sorry there 's no answer 
 i can promise you she wo n't go any lower than $ 35 though '' 
 d2 : 35 dollars for balloons is a lot of money '' 
 me : ... well it 's a lot of balloons '' 
 d1 : takes out $ 20 puts it on the counter you know i 'll pay in cash 
 you said the owner wo n't be back for a while 
 no i did n't 
 you do n't have to ring it up he does n't have to know '' 
 even if i felt like ripping off my boss i do n't she 's great there 's no fucking way i could 've gotten away with that 
 k would 've seen the whole thing the owner has a fucking voicemail talking about the balloons the helium tank would 've been <unk> <unk> and the owner would almost definitely have returned before i was done 
 this is n't to mention that he 's operating with the <unk> of a <unk> brothers movie and two of our good regulars are standing right next to him and heard the entire thing 
 by this time k is drowning in a sea of complicated lotto orders and this one <unk> regular with no patience for anyone that ca n't read her mind 
 i do n't have time to explain how miserable he is at bribery i need to get these cheap fuckers out of the store so i can help her 
 me : look it 's $ 35 for all the balloons or 85¢ per 
 that 's the best i can do 
 now if you 'll excuse me i have paying customers to attend to '' 
 i walk away and start taking the line of people they talk to each other in some foreign language for a bit and leave the store 
 we get the line down laugh about how stupid they were and out of curiosity i call the store with the <unk> 40¢ fill-ups 
 turns out it 's 75¢ apiece and they do n't do any price breaks for fill-ups 
 about 20 minutes later the douches return with two more people in tow douches 3 & amp 4 
 they start asking all sorts of ridiculous questions about all the different costs for all the different <unk> services if there 's anywhere else nearby that can do them cheaper like i 'm going to tell them until we get back to : <unk> : so how much is it to fill up a balloon '' 
 me : 85¢ '' 
 d3 : but same chain as before does it for 60¢ '' 
 d2 : no it 's 40¢ '' 
 me : actually i just called them and they said 75¢ 
 if you 're doing 50 i can price-match that so it 'll be $ <unk> for everything '' 
 d1 : but you said $ 35 '' 
 me : and you said chain charges 40¢ '' 
 d2 : puts one bag of 15 balloons on the counter okay we do n't have any time so you 'll inflate this bag for 75¢ '' 
 me : no i can only price-break if you 're doing it in bulk 
 15 balloons will be $ <unk> '' 
 d2 : but we do n't have time for all 50 anymore '' 
 me : i 'm sorry but that 's not my fault 
 i can price-break at 50 or it 's 85¢ per balloon '' 
 they <unk> in their language again and storm out balloon-less 
 if they were telling the truth about their time crunch they either got no balloons or went to the chain store paying more in gas to get there than they saved and were very late 
 my boss did n't even care about losing the sale once i told her the full story 
 i have instructions to ban them from the premises should they come in again 
 **tl dr : ** grown adults spend half an hour haggling over a few bucks 
 they end up gradually raising the price and failing miserably at <unk> me.this just happened a few minutes ago 
 this morning our phones were down for a few hours 
 they are working now 
 i just received a phone call : m hi thanks for calling -- -- '' c hi just to let you know your phones were n't working this morning '' m i know i 'm sorry about that our phones were down is there anything i can do for you '' 
 c i just wanted to let you know your phones were n't working 
 i see they 're working now but just so you know they were n't this morning 
 that 's all '' 
 click thanks lady for letting me know our phones were n't <unk> used to work in a vegetarian cafe 
 it was a lovely place 
 the owner had given up a stressful career in law to open it and the cafe though reasonably new had become pretty successful 
 we mostly did coffee and cake including gluten-free cake for <unk> - one of the first places in my small town to do so several years ago before the gluten-free <unk> became <unk> rather than a <unk> <unk> 
 but we also had a few main meal options like pasta bake with or without cheese two varieties of soup every day quiche and so on 
 everything was <unk> and some things were vegan too 
 the whole menu was written on a <unk> right inside the door facing the door so you could not miss it 
 we also had menus on the tables and the soups for the day named on further blackboards in the cafe 
 occasionally we had customers like this 
 i shall call the customer fred because i prefer stories with names rather than <unk> of <unk> and i am ally 
 fred had come in with two young children about <unk> years old 
 & gt ally : good afternoon sir are you ready to order 
 & gt fred looking at his menu : do you have sausage rolls 
 & gt ally : no we 're a vegetarian cafe we do n't serve meat 
 & gt fred : oh 
 can i have two <unk> ham sandwiches then please and one chicken sandwich 
 & gt ally : sir we do n't have ham or chicken we 're a vegetarian cafe 
 we can do cheese sandiwches or we 've got quiche pasta bake and our soups today are spicy sweet potato or leek and potato 
 & gt fred sighs : okay two cheese sandiwches brown bread and i 'll have a quiche lorraine 
 quiche lorraine contains bacon 
 & gt ally : we do n't have quiche lorraine we 're a vegetarian cafe 
 today 's quiche is <unk> and tomato 
 & gt fred sighs again : okay i 'll just have that then 
 so i write down his order add the drinks he asks for and leave the table before he asks for a meaty <unk> work at a pet store 
 an older woman came in and looked at dog beds and wanted to take some out to her car to decide which one she wanted 
 she was actually offended that i told her that product can not leave the store without being purchased first 
 taking things out of the store without paying for them is called shoplifting ma'am and that 's a crime in this state 
 yesterday i was running pos at my part-time retail job and right now we have a $ 10 off a $ 30 or more purchase coupon floating around out there 
 now our store is known for giving people just about any type of discount but this coupon states one coupon per person per day '' 
 should be pretty easy right 
 ... .. i was about an hour into my shift when a lady comes up with a <unk> of merchandise which i quickly scan and bag for her 
 i get to the end where i ask if she has any coupons and she hands me a stack of those $ 10 off $ 30 coupons 
 i 'm thinking oh yeah she thinks she 's going to get her entire purchase for free ... '' & gt me : i 'm sorry but i can only accept one of these coupons today as it is one per person per day 
 & gt lady : clearly agitated um no 
 i spent a lot of time picking out things to buy and you can use these all at one time 
 & gt me : again i 'm really sorry but it is a one per day kind of coupon 
 i 'm happy to take $ 10 off your purchase but i ca n't take all of these 
 then i get this response : & gt lady : but my daughter works here and she said i could do it 
 before anyone asks i specifically did n't ask who her daughter was because i did n't want to get accused of trying to get her in trouble but the story works out in the end - i promise 
 i went over the policy again my manager close by but did n't intervene since she could see i was handling it alright 
 the lady seemed to accept the information after a few minutes i also showed where it stated it on the coupon she paid said thank you and went about her merry way 
 couple hours later i went on break and was sitting in the break room with another pos person who was up with me when this situation happened and a floor person 
 we were just chatting when the floor person said ... & gt floor person : oh let me tell y'all 
 my mom came in earlier and said she got this really rude snappy b '' of a cashier ringing her out 
 i knew this was me 
 lol 
 she kept giving the details up to the coupons and i was positive it was me 
 & gt me : oh that was me 
 and i was very polite to your mother 
 i explained our policy to her and she walked out happy 
 the other pos lady was nodding in agreement with me 
 & gt floor person : oh ... looking a little like a deer caught in headlights ... that was you 
 & gt me : yeah and she said her daughter told her that we could take as many coupons as the customer wanted 
 it does n't work that way 
 i was put in a pretty odd situation because i needed to know who her daughter was but i was actually trying to not make a big deal about it with so that you the employee '' could stay out of trouble 
 you might want to know who people are before talking about them and calling them b 's '' 
 she 's only 20. i 'm clearly older than her - by a lot - lol 
 who opens their mouth when they do n't know who people are 
 crazy 
 oh and she 's not on the schedule anymore after this week 
 but that was before - it had nothing to do with me 
 but she does n't necessarily know that.i work at a major national liquor store in the us 
 a customer comes up to me 
 c : do you have whiskey brand 18 
 me : sorry no 
 it 's very hard to come by 
 c : you never have it 
 why do n't you just buy more of it so you can give your customers what they want 
 me : unfortunately they ca n't keep up with demand 
 they did n't know it would be so popular when they started making it 
 c : why do n't they just make more 
 me : i assure you they are 
 c : well how long does it take to make 
 ... me : ... 18 years ... it did n't click 
 only anger was present on her face for a solid five seconds 
 finally her eyes showed a <unk> of revelation 
 she leaned away from my counter turned around and left the store 
 or at least tried to 
 she proceeded to walk through our entrance only side that has 5 big signs saying entrance only no exit '' the doors did n't open 
 she stopped just inches from the sliding doors in <unk> 
 i could n't hold it in anymore 
 i let a <unk> exhale of brief laughter that could not have made that woman more red with anger and <unk> happened this morning 
 i 'm the manager at a photo studio 
 customer- hi i 'm not really happy with the photo i bought can i exchange it for this one instead 
 : <unk> minute to pull up the online system on her tablet : : me- i 'm sorry ma'am we ca n't exchange digital photos 
 once they leave the store you could have saved the image elsewhere and there 's no way to prove that it has n't been 
 customer- what 
 that ridiculous 
 i have n't saved it anywhere this cd has n't even left my purs 
 me- ... ... it 's the background of your tablet 
 people are <unk> 'm a manager at a charity shop 
 this just happened 
 woman comes in to return a pair of trousers that do n't fit her husband 
 we do take returns for that reason but they have to still be in the condition we sold them so they can go back on the rail - they need to have our tag still attached 
 obviously otherwise ppl would wear things then return them or <unk> cheaper items in place of what they bought and get their money back for instance buying a pair of m & amp s trousers bringing us a pair of <unk> trousers they do n't want and getting back what they paid on the m & amp s ones 
 i tell the woman she ca n't have the return she leaves and comes back with her husband 
 he 's a big guy 
 i 'm a 5 '' 2 woman 
 he starts <unk> demanding the return shouting that it does n't matter that the tag 's not attached i 'm not <unk> - the tag has to be attached long story short he throws the trousers at me calls me a <unk> b____ and storms out 
 i burst into tears behind the counter 
 i despair 
 i really despair 
 i get up every morning take two trains to work i submit course work late to <unk> myself to this job i repeated a year of <unk> to keep doing this i work 7 hours a day in a freezing shop with no running water and no heating to provide an essential service to people - and i do it for no pay 
 we hand out free clothes to people who need it we provide an address for homeless people to get their mail we supply cheap <unk> goods for people who ca n't afford new 
 and this is the second time this week i 've been called a b by a customer 
 i 'm sitting in our upstairs office in tears right now and i 'm just so exhausted 
 i ca n't quit cos the shop would close 
 two managers have quit in the last months 
 i ca n't carry on like this much longer cos i ca n't cope 
 edit : i guess i have to carry on 
 looking at these replies pretty much <unk> my knowledge that i 'm the only one who can do this job right now 
 you all think it 's so easy to quit to just walk away from people who need you you think that what makes a job worth it is the money 
 if this job was paid i would have walked away long ago 
 you think that it 's worth abandoning a necessary service to complete a degree 
 and then what 
 why do you think i 'm doing a degree in the first place 
 i chose a subject that will always put me in the centre of helping people 
 i will always work with the most desperate do the jobs that most people will walk away from and i will always do it for low or no pay 
 and when i look for support or empathy when i remind people that even if you think i 'm making a bad decision in carrying on i 'm not some worthless idiot who should take everything thrown at her or an emotionless rock who can always take everything thrown at her i know that people will always tell me to quit 
 okay blah blah long-time lurker first-time whatever 
 here we go 
 **background** this was a few years ago at a gourmet '' grocery store 
 the quotes are for the fact that my store was owned by the dominant local chain and they had decided that they were tired of getting their asses kicked by whole foods in the high-end market so they converted and <unk> one of their stores that was down the street from a whole foods 
 problem being this is in a city in which three blocks makes all the difference 
 whole foods was located near an art supply house a high-end wine distributor and a faux dive bar that people went to ironically 
 **my** store was located near a lot of <unk> a <unk> and a real dive bar that people went to to get stabbed in the neck with a broken bottle 
 and inside it was a dressed-up version of the same shitty grocery store it had always been 
 so one day i 'm working at the meat counter i moved departments a lot 
 my official job title was specialist '' 
 my job was to help out whoever needed it 
 and a rather <unk> woman wandered into my sightline 
 she had a nice <unk> an <unk> and expressionless face and she had a cranky <unk> that all taken together set off every asshole alarm <unk> that i had developed from years of dealing with customers 
 excuse me young man but i need a rack of lamb '' 
 of course ma'am 
 i have some new zealand right here some american over here and i can check in the back because i think we have some argentinian if you prefer '' 
 this store was *huge* on customer service and knowledgeable employees 
 i mean whole foods has those things so we need to as well right 
 yes ... i see the ones in the case there but they wo n't do '' 
 well as i said i think i have some in the <unk> '' are they bigger '' 
 bigger 
 no ma'am i 'm sorry 
 the argentinian are fairly small 
 the biggest we have is the american here '' 
 no those wo n't work 
 i need <unk> '' 
 now these were full racks 
 thirteen or fourteen ribs depending on which ones where they came from and how they were cut 
 longer 
 as in more ribs '' 
 yes yes 
 longer '' 
 at this point she started shouting as if i were either deaf or <unk> <unk> and holding her hands about shoulder <unk> apart 
 i am having ten people over for dinner and i 'm giving them each two lamb chops 
 plus myself '' 
 thanks i was n't sure you 'd be eating at your own dinner party 
 okay that is n't a problem 
 i can make sure you have 22 full chops it will just have to be on two different racks '' 
 no that 's not acceptable '' 
 wellll ... if you 're worried about cooking times i can make sure that they 're the same size 
 i 'll actually have the butcher break down a new lamb just to <unk> '' no 
 not acceptable 
 i 'm doing a crown roast finally 
 thank every god that has ever existed and ever will exist 
 i now know what i can do to make this customer happy 
 oh 
 that 's not a problem 
 they can be tied <unk> with butcher 's twine to make one continuous roast 
 i 'll even do it for you before you go if you would like '' 
 at this point the lady started talking to me as if i were about <unk> stupid 
 **not 
 ack-sept-u-bull 
 ** it has to be one piece of meat 
 find me a roast with 22 ribs 
 i know you can do it 
 why wo n't you help me '' 
 ma'am 
 lambs only have a dozen or so ribs 
 they 're an animal 
 they look a certain way 
 i ca n't create a lamb that has 22 ribs per side 
 i can make you a crown roast with 22 ribs but that is the best i can do honestly '' 
 i have no idea why i had to add the honestly '' bit in there 
 i think that she thought i was just trying to keep the <unk> lamb all for my personal use 
 **not 
 ** '' *oh fuck where did she pick this phrase up 
 * at this point i said fuck customer service and kinda blew up 
 me : it '' 
 her : '' **ack 
 ** '' me : does '' 
 her : ** '' <unk> 
 ** me : not '' 
 her : ** '' uh 
 ** me : exist '' 
 her : ** '' <unk> 
 ** after this little <unk> she looks at me and <unk> a few times like she just awoke from a dream of <unk> <unk> cavorting in the <unk> 
 she <unk> my hand and says it 's okay honey i 'll go ask at whole foods 
 they *always* know what they 're talking about '' 
 <unk> : ** about an hour later the meat department phone rings 
 it 's the butcher from whole foods who i knew enough to nod to on the sidewalk 
 butcher : hey man did you just have some crazy bitch in there asking about <unk> lamb roasts '' 
 me : i do n't know man 
 it 's been pretty crazy here today 
 i mean i field that question at least a dozen times an afternoon ... did she use the word <unk> 
 a lot '' 
 butcher : fuck you 
 did you send this crazy bitch down here '' 
 me : no i could n't help her and she said she 'd go talk to you since you are far more knowledgeable than i. how 'd you handle it '' 
 butcher : i told her you were an idiot and then i <unk> two roasts together and covered the wire with bread <unk> and herbs 
 later loser '' 
 <unk> **tl dr** : a customer wants me to <unk> a time machine go back to the beginning of <unk> and alter the course of evolution 
 **edit** you always miss one letter do n't you 
 this story is my uncle 's as i have mentioned before my family owns an <unk> shop in hayward ca 
 we are open <unk> sun we only do <unk> assistance 
 road service is done by one of my <unk> 
 one sunday my dad gets a call from a customer he has brought a trailer to the shop and demands that we go open the shop for him so he can have all the tires replaced 
 dad tells him that the shop is not open on sundays if he wants service we will call my uncle and he will go do the job 
 dad explains that the cost will be the cost of the service + $ 75 fee 
 the dude bitches about the fee asking why he should pay it if he is at the shop 
 explain that the shop is closed and so we have to send the truck this means a $ 75 fee 
 finally he agrees 
 now our biggest money makers are big tires <unk> and bigger and road side service because we get tons of road side service calls ... all day everyday 
 this means that ever time my uncle is doing a job he was an average of 3 more waiting 
 important info for later on so my uncle shows up at the shop sets up outside of the shop because since the shop is closed we are not letting one in 
 my uncle walks into the shop to get the tires he needs then comes back out with the tires 
 he goes on and does his job 
 charges the guy for the work it was like $ <unk> 
 no problem the guy pays 
 customer : okay i 'm going to take this trailer back to my lot wait here i 'm going to go get another trailer 
 uncle : sorry no can do 
 i have 3 more guys waiting i have to get to them 
 customer : i called you first though uncle : you called me about this trailer you did not mention anything about any other <unk> ... i have to do the jobs i have been told about in the order in which i was told about them im not waiting here it wont be fair to them 
 customer : well let me just call my friend he will bring the trailer it wont take long i promise 
 uncle : no sorry look if you want that job done just tell me what you need where the trailer is and i 'll get to it when i get the time 
 customer : ok i need <unk> done how much will that be i think it was something like a $ <unk> job so the guy is like customer : are you serious i just paid you like $ 400 
 uncle : so this is another job ... .this is where it got weird customer : remember this is a dude come on do it for free ... tell you what if you do it for free and do it right now 
 i 'll suck your dick uncle : wait..what 
 customer : let 's go into the shop i 'll suck your dick first so you know im serious uncle got into the truck and drove away hello tfr 
 my coworker was telling us a story about a table she waited on last night that i thought you might appreciate the story too 
 everything was going fine until she brought out the food 
 then as she was walking away from the table one man spilled his drink onto his pizza 
 she got everything cleaned up got him a new drink and had the kitchen make him a new pizza 
 everything is good right 
 oh we know better than that 
 they finished their food and she took them their checks 
 well this man was furious when he looked at his 
 his pizza was on his ticket 
 no not the second remake 
 we do n't charge for that 
 we are nice like that 
 he thought that his food should be free 
 the food he spilled the drink on 
 some people.i was working in a department store when an elderly couple called me over and asked me to pick up a heavy box of tiles for them 
 while i was lifting it they were talking about the weight of the boxes of tile 
 wife : why do they make the boxes so heavy 
 i feel bad for the workers that have to carry them all the time '' 
 husband : it 's ok maybe it will help him decide he wants to go to college instead of do this the rest of his life '' 
 i usually worked nights so i did n't really know how to deal with rude customers so instead of just letting it be i responded : i tried that 
 was n't my thing 
 that 's why i 'm about to leave for <unk> '' 
 that shut him up but i felt bad after seeing the look of sheer embarrassment on his wife 's face 
 she apologized and i came to find out that he was ex <unk> himself 
 that 's when i realized that sometimes when a customer is being rude the people with them are the ones that feel the worst about it.at first i thought this old lady was one of those people who ca n't make up their mind deliberately in order to get attention 
 you know those people 
 they um and er but never challenge anything you say because they do n't want to get in trouble just kinda ... talk for a while ... even if its <unk> and weird talk 
 but anyway that 's how this lady talked until she started getting side tracked ... & gt customer : i wanted to get this on canvas but do you know how much they wanted for it 
 its so expensive 
 even for one this size 
 they wanted so much for it i was like 'my ... and they said i had to wait two weeks 
 and they wanted $ 60 for it 
 for a canvas this size 
 it took a couple of tries to get her to pay for one laminate because she did n't want to pay for two together 
 one was already done one needed to be done 
 they were only $ 3 each but she insisted on paying for one and then the other one later 
 she 'd kept on talking this whole time about fairly uninteresting and irrelevant subjects until she had a great idea 
 & gt customer : there should be a factory you can go to where you can tell them exactly what you want and they do it for you on the spot and its really cheap 
 & gt me : well ... & gt customer : would n't that be good 
 & gt me : yeah i mean it 'd be ideal 
 & gt customer : maybe this company should have a factory where you can go and get whatever you want 
 you just tell them and they do it for you right away 
 & gt me : i 'm sure that would be a great addition to the business 
 & gt customer : i 'm sure there are places on the internet you can go that i have n't been -- me : i 'm sure there are 
 & gt customer : -- where you can do something like that 
 maybe you can even buy them online 
 i think you can you know 
 & gt me : you mean you can buy factories online 
 & gt customer : no 
 <unk> 
 i 'm sure there must be 
 but it 'd just be so nice to be able to go there ... and that its really cheap 
 me : i know what you mean 
 i went to a car dealership the other day and they wanted $ <unk> for a car -- customer : really 
 me : -- yeah and i said <unk> i 've only got $ <unk> in my pocket 
 this would be a lot easier if it were cheaper '' 
 customer : well that 's <unk> i got the dreaded closing shift which meant dealing with last second customers making messes in a rush to get their eggs or laundry <unk> that they absolutely need tonight and not tomorrow morning or else how could they possibly continue living 
 at <unk> pm i get a whole group of these customers <unk> of a mom dad and three loud obnoxious kids 
 the mom takes her sweet time grabbing cheese and eggs and whatever else she needs as she tells her children they ca n't kick us out it 's illegal 
 i can take as long as i need and if she meaning me tries to kick us out i 'll call over the gm and she 'll get in trouble '' 
 i almost laughed at that 
 i really wanted to be like ma'am i will happily call over my gm for you and then she will happily kick you out herself '' 
 even better as she was leaving 5 minutes after we closed my coworker comes over and tells me that she said we could get fined for kicking her out and we 'd have to pay $ 15,000 
 wish she had stayed in the store so that we could have called the police and watched her explain to them that if they kick her out they 'd have to pay $ 15,000 
 i work at the counter in a department store with an exit that has an electric lock and each time a customer needs out i must press a button to let them out 
 if it gets busy i end up not being able to hit the button before another customer wanting to exit reaches the door and even though there is a sign that tells them to please wait they get angry some times 
 i was ringing up an elderly woman with what i could swear was at least three months worth of food in 2 <unk> so both of my hands are busy and this guy i will <unk> was around 40 years old goes to the door 
 i am in the middle of bagging some items and i am about to tell him give me one second he whistles at me like he is calling a dog 
 i stop look over at him 
 he whistles again 
 i stare at this guy like he is a moron and to spite him i bag up a few more items with him whistling at me and the old lady says to this guy i do not think he likes being <unk> at like he is a dog 
 the guy then says can you open the f & amp ^ % ing door 
 i put the bag in my hand down and look at him 
 i place my hand over the door and not pressing it i said 
 wait for it wait for it i press the button and say go 
 he reaches for the door and opens it and i then said good boy 
 he stops and says i am not a f*^ # ing dog 
 i replied neither am i just go 
 he stomped off all pissed off the old woman laughed and i finished bagging her up 
 i am surprised that i was not called to the office and fired for this 
 so a little background first i used to work as a cashier for a high end all <unk> grocery store 
 we dealt with the snobbiest of the snobby as we were in a wealthy area of socal 
 while i was there i was playing poker full time as well using the <unk> from this job to cover me in the event of a losing night so one day i had this customer with his cart loaded to brim with everything from cookies to vitamins 
 i can already tell his bill is gon na be somewhere between $ <unk> $ <unk> 
 something easy to do in the store 
 immediately the guy starts being a snob ordering me to empty his basket while he stood there on his phone texting the whole time 
 he had me fetch several other items for him as well not bothering to unload while i was gone 
 it took me a solid 10 minutes to ring up his items and another 15 to bag it all up as he refused to lift finger 
 so finally when this all said and done his bill comes out to a little over $ 1300 
 this man had the audacity to <unk> at me and say that 's it 
 pfft '' 
 and proceeded to slide his card 
 after punching in his info his card was declined 
 he looked at me like i just took a shit on his chest 
 he said run it again '' 
 so after 3 more attempts i finally ask him do you maybe have another card you can use 
 this one does n't seem to be <unk> 
 he responded with do n't take that tone with me 
 i make more money in a week than you do in a year 
 run my damn card '' 
 after several more attempts he demanded to talk to my manager proclaiming it was my fault his card was declining 
 after having my manager run his card several more times to the same result he just exploded with rage calling us <unk> and that he was going to boycott the store 
 i was so frustrated and finally had enough with this asshole and exclaimed watch this '' 
 i took out my debit card ran it through the machine typed in my pin and to his shock it went through 
 he started stammering in shock 
 i can only imagine what was going through his mind that this lowly cashier '' was able to buy his groceries no problem 
 he promptly left the store and never came back 
 needless to say my manager was shocked and i got a refund on all the groceries 
 fuck people for looking down their noses at cashiers 
 edit 1 : after reading some of the comments i decided to clarify 
 the customer did not leave with the groceries he promptly exited the store i got my refund and the items were returned to their shelves 
 edit 2 : spelling/grammar may have missed something hello : my first post 
 working a big typical retail store <unk> ect 
 today i get put on the returns desk 
 angry lady who i 'll <unk> for comes in & gt hello i 'd like to return this bra ''no problem do you have your receipt '' 
 & gt no why do you ask 
 ''it 's just easier to return with a receipt did you pay via card '' 
 i mean what 
 she was at least 40 she should have known by now what a receipt was for & gt yes i did 
 ''okay well i should be able to look up the purchase '' start trying to look up the purchase and get nothing ''ma'am i ca n't find your purchase here i 'm sorry i ca n't refund you '' & gt well that is ridiculous ''sorry company rules '' & gt i bought it yesterday you should be able to find that 
 ''it 's not coming up on here '' & gt i bought it yesterday i can even remember which shop i got it at <unk> you get it at one of our shops '' 
 & gt no i got it at names a shop down the road no even part of this place ''ma'am that shop has nothing to do with ours you 'd have to go there for a refund '' & gt why are you being so unhelpful you stock the exact same bras 
 ''well yes but company policy does n't work like that '' & gt i am done talking to you get me a manger right now 
 after complaining to a manager about how unhelpful i was manager finally asks her what the problem is & gt i bought this bra only yesterday at ____ down the road and that child wo n't refund it for me 
 manager then explains we do n't take other shops returns 
 woman finally storms out saying loudly about how unhelpful we all were 
 so i work in a popular chain cafe and yesterday morning i was working my way through the early morning <unk> '' rush by myself 
 a middle aged couple looking quite smart in business suits came up to the till and the wife ordered a coffee and a pastry and i turned to the husband to take his order 
 he asked quite politely whether there was any almond croissants 
 we display all our cakes and pastries in a display case next to the till and there was clearly no almond croissants at all 
 so i told him there was n't any but i could offer him an alternative 
 well.. your menu says there 's <unk> '' he grumbled but i just played along and apologised again telling him there 's nothing i can do 
 i asked him if he wanted a different pastry or a coffee and he just spun around and stormed over and sat down at a table on the opposite side of the cafe in a <unk> 
 no <unk> like a <unk> <unk> grown man pouted and crossed his arms and sat sulking in his chair 
 so i turned to his wife and asked if there was any other drinks as the man had n't ordered one 
 she looked so embarrassed i felt so sorry for her 
 and she turned and half-shouted across the cafe to her husband asking what drink he wanted 
 and he looked up and huffed and puffed and shouted well.. i do n't even know if i want a coffee now '' 
 and went back to having a tantrum 
 there was a bit of a queue piling up behind the wife now and they all just looked at him <unk> are you serious 
 so i just made the wife 's drink and she went and sat down embarrassed next to her husband 
 <unk> the man next to them in queue who did n't look as if he was associated with them at all went and sat down with them 
 the sulking man then proceeded to take out his laptop and give a business pitch to the other <unk> who was his client 
 the guy had had a tantrum in front of his wife and a client i make the rotisserie chickens at a major grocery store chain and today a woman came up to me and said i bought one of these here yesterday and one of the wings was missing '' 
 which 
 fine 
 it 's a mistake that happens sometimes 
 i was off yesterday so it was n't my fault but that 's not the point 
 i 'm about to apologize for that inconvenience etc. but then she adds do n't you know how to do your job 
 why was the wing missing '' 
 and it was a horrible rude tone so i said we do n't discriminate against the physically handicapped '' 
 she eventually complained and i was scolded 
 i hate this job i work at a chain corner store <unk> retail pharmacy usually working checkout in the front 
 yesterday i was only an hour into my shift when i saw a young boy walk in maybe 4 or 5 and head right to the candy isle 
 i did n't see his parents walk in so i kept an eye on him while he did his candy hunting 
 after about 10 minutes he came up to my register and set down 4 pieces of candy and asked me how much it all was 
 i rang it up and it was about $ <unk> but he only had $ 4 in quarters 
 i told him this and he looked a little <unk> and went back to find some different candy 
 another 5 minutes passes and he comes back up with some smaller but cheaper candy and asked me to ring it up again 
 this time it was <unk> $ 4.50 and i gave him some of my pocket change so he could keep the candy 
 as the receipt was printing i asked him where his parents were 
 he gave me the biggest and <unk> smile and said mommy says i 'm a big boy now 
 i can get my own candy '' 
 then he ran to the exit with this bag full of candy 
 i decided to follow him because a it was n't busy and b because i assumed he had walked from home to the store or something similar 
 turns out his mother was waiting right outside and had been watching our exchange the whole time 
 the mom sent the boy to her van and told me she was trying to teach him to be more independent 
 i guess giving him some <unk> to buy his own candy was a start 
 i went back to the register with a smile on my face for the rest of the day because i can only imagine how good that candy must have tasted when you pick it out yourself and pay with your own money 
 sometimes it 's the little <unk> work at a <unk> in a <unk> seaside town 
 we also <unk> a tower which is climbable and which looks quite lovely at night 
 we have nice grounds and gardens and often host <unk> or other events after hours we close at 7pm 
 one night i 'm working a wedding 
 it 's about 8:30pm 
 the music is <unk> and the guests are politely smashed 
 because we have to keep the front door unlocked so guests of the wedding can come and go we have a sign on the door saying we are closed for a private event 
 a family of four appear at the door : a woman her mother and her two teenaged children 
 they stand at the door and read the sign then open the door and come into the lobby 
 woman : are you open '' 
 me : no i 'm afraid we 're closed for a wedding '' 
 i tell her when we will be open tomorrow 
 woman : we 're leaving town tomorrow 
 can we still climb the tower '' 
 this logic does nothing for me 
 we 're open from 9am to 7pm 
 you could n't have found time during the day to stop by then 
 also no you ca n't climb the tower because it 's locked at its usual 7pm time regardless of any event on the grounds 
 me : i 'm sorry but there is nothing i can do 
 the grounds are for the private event '' 
 woman : but i brought my mother all the way up the hill to climb the tower 
 you 're telling me she ca n't climb '' 
 again this does nothing 
 if we did n't have a wedding going on we would not only still be closed but the front doors would be locked the lights would be out and i would n't be there for you to argue with 
 and i 'm not going to feel sorry for your mother for climbing the hill if she was prepared to climb the tower as well 
 i ask her to please leave 
 basically if she tries to go any further they would technically be crashing the wedding and i ca n't imagine the wedding party would be pleased we let them through 
 woman : well let 's at least take some pictures '' 
 they go up to the door leading out to the grounds and the tower the opposite direction of the exit 
 woman : can we go outside to take photos '' 
 me : i 'm sorry but i ca n't allow that 
 there 
 is 
 a. private 
 event 
 going 
 on '' 
 they stand at the doors and try to take photos through the glass 
 their flash photography makes the photos too washed out with the light bouncing off the glass 
 they grumble about how bad their photos are coming out 
 just then a wedding guest comes through the door to ask where the bathroom is 
 the woman says go 
 go '' 
 and she and her family take the opportunity of the open door to hurry outside towards the wedding 
 now i 'm small but i work with children during the <unk> and i can have an authoritative voice when i want to 
 i go to the door and shout to the family : excuse me '' 
 they turn and look back at me 
 me : there is a private event going on 
 i 'm going to have to ask you to leave '' 
 they finally get the idea 
 they grumble some more but at least they have their precious <unk> and they finally leave 
 **tl/dr : family does n't understand that being closed for a private event still means we 're closed 
 deal with it 
 <unk> so my latest tale was well received and so i thought i might share my favorite moment in the long and <unk> job history that is mine 
 and it <unk> a <unk> famous person to boot ... when i was ten i had the fortunate experience to begin work at a semi well known theater in waterford <unk> where many a star and playwright began their <unk> 
 this is a place that holds a <unk> playwrights conference each year during the summer where many promising <unk> compete to have their best work fine tuned into <unk> 
 the pieces are given to promising young actors who work the plays each night <unk> in hand <unk> with changes in front of live <unk> ... <unk> props simple sets ... <unk> the work 
 each morning <unk> directors and <unk> work with the playwright to <unk> audience reactions and tweak the <unk> till they shine 
 it 's a fun <unk> place to work 
 fortunately my mother worked in the small print shop and after a few weeks of hanging around the theaters i was give a job as an usher 
 it was an unpaid gig but it guaranteed entry and killer seats to any and all the plays during the season ... and as a kid who loved theater it was better than money 
 i worked there from the age of ten till i graduated high school and loved every minute 
 i have a hundred stories from those summer nights but one stands out from the rest ... two summers in there came a time when our awesome stage manager had to quit for another gig 
 being the most senior of the present ushers and mature for my age the managers of the theater asked if i would step in for a night or two while they filled the <unk> days become a week and a week became a month and i was doing a really good job 
 but my hopes of keeping the gig were <unk> when they filled the position with the mother of all insecure <unk> bitches 
 she hated me from the moment she realized that a twelve year old had essentially been doing her job ... and she made sure to remind me of my place whenever possible 
 often after saving myself a seat with my jacket i would find it moved as the lights turned down for the performance 
 her excuse 
 only legitimate customers should have decent seats despite our unpaid status 
 soon i could only hope to get a middle orchestra seat if i <unk> did it when she was n't looking 
 the hate was becoming seriously mutual and i had begun to think of quitting 
 but i had to wait till the end of the month because i wanted to see one play in particular ... a musical version of fahrenheit <unk> besides being one of my favorite books i had been watching the rehearsals for weeks and the score was amazing 
 it had two of my friends in it and it was rumored that the playwright had even invited ray bradbury to come to opening night ... .and he had accepted 
 i was n't going to miss it for anything 
 that night turned out to have one of the harshest thunderstorms of the summer for ct. it was pouring and the wind was <unk> 
 i had been extra careful <unk> a seat for myself ... or at least i thought i had 
 and it was a half hour from curtain 
 suddenly my bitch manager appeared out of nowhere and demanded i go to the mansion to tell mr. bradbury 's agent that it was time to get seated 
 now let me explain the mansion '' 
 this theater was built on the grounds of an old estate in waterford 
 it had several <unk> and the main stage was in a converted barn where tonight 's performance was 
 about a quarter of a mile across the estate lay the mansion that <unk> the theater offices <unk> and the <unk> 
 she essentially wanted me to run a quarter of a mile in the pouring rain to ask a guest to come down ... despite the fact that there were phones 
 when i tried to argue she threatened my position 
 i was pissed but i began to run 
 i show up <unk> at the lounge in the mansion to see a <unk> man finishing the <unk> of a huge meal 
 he hardly <unk> me when i speak to him and then tells me that i 'm dismissed '' 
 by this point i 'm getting way too pissed to even speak so i run back to the barn sopping wet 
 it 's almost curtain time and as soon as i hit the barn i scan for my jacket and my seat ... only to find them moved to the back railing 
 it 's now standing room only which we allowed with our <unk> nature and i 'm done 
 completely 
 i look around and see my manager speaking to a grey <unk> gentleman in the front row 
 i quickly walk to where they are standing and my presence naturally draws their attention 
 i tell my manager that i 've done what she 's asked and i 'm going home 
 she actually smirks and walks away 
 turning around to leave the gentleman says '' are n't you staying for the play 
 it 's supposed to be wonderful '' 
 i sigh and without thinking i tell him that i 've just had the worst night ever lost my seat to an ungrateful boss gotten sopping wet tracking down an ego case at the mansion and that even though i was looking forward to it ... well it 's obvious that its time to go home 
 he suddenly says i 'm so sorry 
 my agent really is a self righteous ass is n't he '' 
 that 's when i realize who i 'm talking to ... mr. bradbury ... himself 
 between the self pity and him being a lot older than pics i 'd seen of him i had n't even recognized him 
 i begin to apologize profusely for being so <unk> but he wo n't hear any of it ... instead he starts looking around and motioning for my bitch manager to come over 
 mr. bradbury suddenly all business : this young lady is sitting with me this evening ... i will need a towel and another seat right here in the aisle '' 
 bitchy manager : but sir she ca n't sit here ... it breaks fire codes and besides ... she 's an u..usher '' 
 mr. bradbury : i do n't give a crap about fire codes ... she 's sitting here or i 'm not staying 
 now get her a towel and a chair '' 
 she looks at me 
 i look at her 
 i smile a smile three miles wide 
 she sighs and slinks off 
 she ever so <unk> returns with the requested items but this time ca n't make eye contact 
 i <unk> 
 mr bradbury gesturing to a seat dead front and center : my lady shall we enjoy the show '' 
 i did n't walk ... .i <unk> 
 and that my friends is how i got to spend an evening watching the coolest musical ever sitting right next to mr ray bradbury discussing with him the <unk> points of the musical during <unk> and chuckling about how annoying his agent and my boss could be 
 after that night my manager basically gave up being rude to me 
 she did n't last long after that and i went on to spend many a wonderful summers there 
 gas station worker here 
 we had some crazies coming to our store but this became one of our top 3. a lady came in and paid $ 20 for the gas 
 after 5 or 10 minutes later the lady came back inside furiously 
 & gt lady : **hey 
 ** excuse me 
 & gt me : <unk> out other <unk> yes 
 & gt lady : what are you doing 
 pump my gas 
 & gt me : is there anything wrong with the pump 
 the lady just ignored me and left the store 
 & gt <unk> : 
 we were kind of confused why i had to go pump this lady 's gas 
 the pump was n't <unk> or had any problem pump 's status is shown on our register screen 
 also our gas station is a self-serve and customers consistently came in so none of us had time to go outside 
 after few more minutes the lady came back 
 & gt lady : <unk> 
 ** did you hear me 
 pump my gas 
 then she left again 
 a moment later we hear honking outside 
 this lady was just repeatedly honking in her car looking straight us 
 & gt coworker : dude you should go check it out ... damn right 
 so i went outside to check what 's going on and apparently this lady just wanted me to pump her gas 
 she kept looking at me with a straight face the whole time while i was pumping the gas 
 it was one of the most awkward moment in my life 
 & gt lady : you know this is s*** service 
 right 
 & gt me : ... ok ... after pumping the gas i came back to the store 
 about 5 minutes later this lady came back again 
 & gt lady : refund 
 & gt me : ... ... ... excuse me 
 & gt lady : i want a refund for this c*** service 
 & gt me : um ... no 
 gasoline is already in the tank 
 the lady starts <unk> about this c*** service '' and started to yell at us 
 & gt coworker : you want to call the police 
 i will call police right now 
 & gt lady : just give refund my money 
 & gt coworker : nope 
 i 'm calling the police right now 
 then the lady just left the store flipping a finger at both of us 
 the craziest part is that this lady did n't seem to be drunk or under drug influence 
 this experience made me really question how these people can function within society 
 edit : i just wanted to clarify some things ... we are located in ca 
 i never lived outside ca so i did n't know self-serve is illegal in some states 
 this lady was not disabled 
 maybe mentally but not physically 
 you gave up '' - well 
 just think about my situation 
 customers consistently coming in just me and my coworker on registers crazy lady honking outside yelling at us 
 i could have refused further service to her but i 'm pretty damn sure it would have made things <unk> happened today at the <unk> shop i work at 
 i was at the coffee machine and had a small line of people waiting for their coffees when a woman comes up to the store and proceeds to attach her dogs leash to the handle on our front door 
 the dog was barking a lot and she started to walk in 
 i 'll be me '' and she will be dl '' for dog lady 
 me : i 'm sorry ma'am you ca n't tether your dog to the front door 
 there 's an area over to the left where people often tether their dogs 
 dl : no she needs to be right by the door so she can see me the whole time or she gets upset 
 me : i 'm sorry but people ca n't get in or out if your dog is there 
 dl : fine i 'll go somewhere else then 
 mind you the place where you can tether your dog is still visible from inside the store 
 it was just so strange to me that someone would try and tie their dog to the handle of the front door that people need to use to get in and out 
 did she not think people would try and exit and hit her dog with the door 
 it was like any day at the restaurant with orders being places customers patiently waiting for their orders etc 
 i was at the cash register and just helped a lady complete a credit card transaction 
 the day continued 
 later she called and asked if we had taken her credit card 
 i tell her no because i physically handed her her card and watched as she put it in her purse 
 she then accused me of lying and stealing her credit card in an attempt to steal her money 
 i told her to check her purse 
 she did n't want to listen and threatened to call the police 
 i told her to go right ahead 
 the police never came but she returned 
 she came crashing through the doors raging like a wild animal 
 the other customers were suddenly interested in that we had somehow turned into a zoo 
 she is shouting ranting threatening and <unk> and so on and so forth about me and the restaurant 
 i could n't calm her down but decided to try 
 i told her that i can magically make her card appear in her purse 
 she laughed and called me an idiot 
 in response i just said to check her purse 
 she <unk> dumped out the contents of her purse and lo and behold the card fell out 
 i did n't say anything and neither did she 
 she however gave me one last insult and ran out the door 
 the whole restaurant erupted in laughter which for a time gave everyone something to remember on a rainy <unk> work at a very well-known retail chain on the <unk> 
 i was working an evening shift during the week when the girl working customer service gets a call from the electronics department 
 she flags me over frantically 
 & gt girl : apparently there 's a man coming up with a tv in his cart that he did n't pay for it still has the spider wire on it so we think he 's going to steal it 
 oh perfect 
 i quickly walk to the front doors and see a man <unk> it to the front through the fashion department 
 only a little suspicious 
 i stand in front of the doors to meet him when he arrives 
 & gt me : can i see your receipt for that tv sir 
 & gt him : oh ... uh 
 my wife has it she 's back in electronics 
 & gt me : oh okay 
 no problem 
 we 'll wait for her 
 & gt him : uhh ... okay 
 he actually does n't move to my amazement 
 time passes 
 & gt me : it 's weird how they did n't remove the spider wire huh 
 they normally do when you ... *buy it* 
 & gt him : yeah i thought that was weird too 
 ... she has the receipt with her you know 
 & gt me : yes i know 
 we 're just waiting 
 another ten seconds pass 
 & gt him : i 'm going to let her know she has to bring the receipt up 
 he leaves the cart and walks out the front door 
 i bring the tv over to customer service being sure to let the girl working know that he 'll be back with his receipt 
 we saved about $ 1500 with that one so i have the <unk> fortune of working as a cashier at a certain store that loves edit removed color 
 i 'm sleep deprived but i 'm trying my best to make sure everyone that goes through my till is happier by the end of their transaction 
 all of a sudden everything goes so terribly wrong 
 from the moment this middle-aged woman opened her mouth an <unk> of despair <unk> over me - something was just <unk> about this lady 
 hoping for the best i begun ringing her through 
 we make small talk more so in an effort to keep myself <unk> and not zone out 
 everything is going as well as it could 
 & gt me : alrighty grand total is going to come out to be ... $ <unk> please '' 
 & gt lady : okay 
 that 'll be debit please '' 
 all of a sudden the dreaded math <unk> steal any sense of logical thought from this woman 
 & gt lady : wait that 's not right '' 
 & gt me : what 's not right 
 did something ring up as more than it should 
 would you like a <unk> slip of what every item came up as '' 
 & gt lady : yes that would be good 
 it 's too much '' 
 <unk> as any human i sometimes scan an item twice and give the benefit of doubt to this woman 
 the slip prints out and the truth was revealed : as usual the customer was wrong 
 i showed this slip and all its prices to the woman thinking that would be enough 
 & gt lady : that 's not right 
 it 's too much '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but did something ring in at too much 
 did something not come up at its sale price '' 
 & gt lady : no it 's too much still '' 
 at this point i 'm getting frustrated 
 i 'm the only one on a till at this end of the store and the <unk> of customers is only growing in size and impatience 
 in a last-ditch effort i ask her a question 
 & gt me : is it not added up correctly '' 
 & gt lady : yes i think that 's the issue '' 
 we have *never* had an issue with our tills not adding up a total 
 i pull out a calculator and offer to add up everything on the slip to confirm it 's correct 
 & gt me : okay i 'm going to add everything up here 
 if at any point i 'm not entering a number in correctly stop me '' 
 & gt lady : yes thank you '' 
 every number is entered and <unk> the total is <unk> <unk> 
 & gt me : the total is correct 
 do you still want everything '' 
 & gt lady : yes i want everything but it 's still too high '' 
 & gt me : is there anything wrong with the prices of the items or taxes being added '' 
 & gt lady : no '' 
 & gt me : i do n't really see the issue here ma'am '' 
 & gt lady : it 's just too high '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry but this is how addition and taxes work '' 
 & gt lady : that 's stupid 
 it should n't be that way '' 
 & gt me : i apologize that i have no control over how numbers work '' 
 she pays grumbles and walks off 
 i hate my <unk> back i realize how fucked up this was but at the time i was just trying to earn a living being a broke college student 
 just a warning this is long and a bit gross <unk> 
 i was working at a fast food restaurant and had been there for over a year 
 it was a pretty strict clockwork method place and although there was no love or compassion there it gave me 40 hours 
 even though it was nice money i wanted to quit for a while just never had a reason or an alternative route to go to 
 until one <unk> i was a closer 
 basically a shitty shift but the only thing a full time college student can do 
 store would close at 11pm and i’d be out around <unk> it’s around 10 pm and i’m doing <unk> minding my own business when the manager on that we will call a asked me to go clean the bathrooms 
 i said sure why not something i was used to doing 
 i go into the women’s bathroom and open up the first stall to find it stuff with toilet paper 
 now i’ve seen worse so i just shrug and flush 
 we had some pretty intense toilets so i figured it would go down 
 this is about to get gross and <unk> turn back now if you don’t want to know 
 it didn’t 
 instead the toilet paper rolled and revealed a massive amount of blood 
 like a crazy amount of <unk> and <unk> blood 
 being an <unk> female i knew that this was way too much blood for a <unk> <unk> 
 my mind going blank i tried to flush it again when i <unk> 
 i looked a little closer and realize i was looking at a super tiny hand 
 like the littlest hand i’ve ever seen 
 this was when it hit me that this was something i didn’t want to see 
 i hightailed my ass out of there and went to the manager 
 “a there is something in the <unk> can’t be in there you have to call the <unk> now the gm of the store was a mega bitch but i figured you kind of have to be a mega bitch to work in a huge corporation like she did 
 we will call her s. a on the other hand is the same age as me having had started working at the store when he was 16 and made his way up to manager 
 he was a nice guy and someone i considered a friend 
 i didn’t realize until a told me to come to back to the break room that i was near tears 
 <unk> i probably realized that what was in the toilet was what it was but it hadn’t quite hit reality yet 
 <unk> under what is in there so i can call <unk> a says as he is trying to calm me down 
 “i walked in and there was lots of blood and bits and pieces and….” i begin to have to wipe tears from my eyes and i’m still not sure why but i felt stupid for doing it at the time 
 he calls the gm while i compose myself in the break room 
 he comes back a few minutes late and sighs really loudly 
 “s said there isn’t anything we can do but flush it.” i blankly stared at him and was waiting for him to tell me to leave it be till the cleaning crew got there in an hour 
 he then tells me that i need to go back and flush it 
 i tried to explain i couldn’t do it and he handed me a box of the cheap blue gloves we used to handle food and walked away 
 i then learned two things : this job sucked ass and a was not my friend 
 my other two co-workers just stared at me as i walked through the kitchen to the bathrooms 
 i kept randomly crying and couldn’t figure out why 
 a was ever so kind enough to put a <unk> for <unk> sign up on the door 
 i walked back in and once again saw this little hand and immediately walked out 
 i went back to the counter and a asked if it was gone 
 i asked if i could please use one of the heavy maintenance gloves 
 he said no 
 i then pleaded for him to send someone else to do it 
 my male coworker piped up from the back and said he would do it but a told me to go back and just get it over with 
 i flushed and flushed and eventually the toilet paper mass must have broken up for it finally went down the <unk> 
 i’m really not sure how long it took but it felt like and enternity 
 i stayed silent the rest of the night and the next morning when i woke up i knew that it was the final straw 
 i called work told the gm i was done and wasn’t coming in that night to close 
 she asked why and i told her after last night i couldn’t face that place 
 she informed me that if i quit without a <unk> notice i would be banned from working at any of the stores that <unk> that name 
 i was ok with that 
 to receive my last paycheck i’d have to turn in my uniform and give a written notice why i quit 
 i walked in during supper rush and s the gm handed me the paper to write 
 i wrote “i’m quitting because i was forced to flush a late term miscarriage down the toilet.” s tore it up and handed me another paper and told me to rewrite it 
 i wrote the same thing 
 she told me to stop being silly and i loudly asked why it was wrong to write that they made me flush the miscarriage down the toilet 
 yes i did it in front of a crowd and no i didn’t really care 
 she was so embarrassed that she handed me my paycheck and walked away 
 i haven’t been back there since 
 i still don’t really understand why i was so upset 
 i lived on a small farm as a child and was raised around hunters 
 i saw death and butchering all the time 
 i guess just seeing something unfamiliar in a very familiar place was just nerve <unk> 
 i now know that it was a pretty late term miscarriage maybe a home abortion but i try not to think like that probably around 17 to 18 weeks 
 i’m guessing that the person was pretty scared and didn’t know what to do and just left 
 i like to tell myself she didn’t mean to leave it behind and make me deal with it 
 either way it was a pretty bad time 
 tl/dr : college job made me flush a late term miscarriage down the toilet 
 <unk> would not do again 
 edit : i just got back from my <unk> prenatal class and really was n't expecting this response 
 i 'm going to try and answer as many questions as i can 
 one <unk> question i 've noticed is why did i do it to begin with 
 i was scared this was my first job and my mind kind of shut down 
 the other questions is if a knew it was a miscarriage 
 i made him well aware that it was and i kept telling him about the tiny hand 
 i left out in detail how i became a bit hysterical when i came back from my first visit 
 lastly i would really love to tell everyone the corporation 's name but i do n't want to be banned from this subreddit : it 's my absolutely favorite place to vent 
 i know that this has a struck a huge cord with a lot of people and that some would like to boycott 
 i ca n't say that this would be the choice for all of the stores in this franchise and do n't want people to <unk> the actions of one store <unk> the whole company as a whole 
 i think the reason why they made me flush it was the store was relatively new and had yet to even make a profit 
 the idea of a <unk> probably scared the gm 
 i think its too late to report it now as it has been nearly 5 years 
 thank you all for the messages and the concerns and i 'll get back to you folks later tonight 
 yesterday before my shift i noticed it was pretty dead so i approached the register and made idle smalltalk with my co-worker 
 she was pretty much done cleaning up my station and we were just talking about how gross the pastries in our display start looking calorie/sugar content wise after you 've worked there for a while 
 so we 're talking for a few minutes 
 not long at all before an older woman who had been seated at the bar by our espresso just staring at us started almost screaming out excuse me 
 excuse 
 me 
 hey '' 
 my co-worker who we 'll call sunny '' turned and walked over to her and asked her how can i help you today '' 
 the woman stared at her for a few moments before saying are you done talking and ready to take my order 
 i 'd really hate to inconvenience *you* '' 
 sunny handled it pretty well and explained to the lady that to make a to-go order she would need to approach the register and that we do n't take those orders from seated customers especially customers who already have bagged up food from whatever they ate dining in 
 which the lady did have several to-go boxes already with her 
 the lady made a huge deal of getting up and walking over to the register 
 i decided to clock in while she <unk> over to us 
 while i was punching in my number and tying my apron she just stood at the register i was at and stared at me 
 i directed her to the open register and she just stayed where she was 
 i then explained that i was n't on the clock and sunny will be more than happy to help her 
 she rolled her eyes and barked out <unk> soup '' 
 i rolled my eyes and asked medium or large '' 
 large '' 
 sunny went to the back to make it and i clocked in and rung it up for her 
 the lady kind of wandered over to our display and looked at it for a while 
 she came back to my register i was standing at the open register this time and just stood there 
 i was still in a pretty decent mood despite how short and abnormally rude she was being 
 so i remained casual and waited for her order 
 she finally says you need to take your hand out of your pocket '' 
 this is a terrible habit of mine 
 i always keep my left hand in my pocket and ring people up with my right 
 now because i do n't handle food without gloves on ... no one ever says anything about it 
 but i had the strong feeling that this was n't really a big deal to her 
 at this point something i did or said when i walked in the door made her hate me 
 i do n't know what it was ... but it was something 
 i took my hand out of my pocket and raised my <unk> in a <unk> let 's get this show on the road so you can gtfo kind of manner and she proceeded to say i want one creme brulee '' 
 we have three different kinds of creme brulee 
 i asked if she wanted the one with sprinkles <unk> or vanilla 
 she just rolled her eyes and said the creme brulee 
 duh '' 
 so i just gave her whatever was in the back of the 'throw out in an hour slightly smashed up against a metal rail in the cooler creme brulee and packaged her soup before ringing her up 
 she placed her money directly on the counter in front of my register where i could n't reach it 
 so i had to come around to the front and pick it up and take it back to my till where i finished the transaction and put the money back on the counter and slid it over to her 
 she took it pocketed it and grabbed her bag 
 then she said can i have your name '' 
 out of curiosity i just had to ask ... why 
 what have i done wrong besides put my hand in my pocket '' 
 she then looked at me with this look of pure hatred that i ca n't explain and said this is n't your goddamn social hour 
 you come here to work 
 not talk about how gross your food is not to <unk> off how skinny you are and not to show off your political views 
 this 
 is 
 work 
 remember that when corporate fires you and you have to find a job at some other restaurant '' 
 i was shocked 
 sure my co-worker and i discussed the calorie count in our desserts 
 but my political views 
 so being bold again i asked i 'm sorry i understand that i did in fact make comments about the calorie count in our desserts 
 and i 'm truly sorry if it offended you 
 though i 'm just curious as to when i stated my political views '' 
 she then said i saw that nra sticker on the back of your truck when you pulled in 
 you <unk> this company and now i 'm never eating here again 
 in fact you 're pretty mouthy 
 go get your manager '' 
 the nra sticker on the back of my <unk> truck 
 but fine whatever 
 i got my manager who explained to her that a tiny almost invisible round sticker with the letters <unk> on it was not grounds to get me fired 
 neither was discussing the calories in an item 
 and that her behavior was inappropriate and turning into harassment and that he would appreciate it if she left 
 the rest of the night was fine 
 but damn 
 i think she just did n't like me 
 i get a call on the floor phone last night about 45 minutes before close : you got to get out here there 's a customer in video that 's real upset '' i respond get jeff he 's the video manager '' 
 that 's the problem jeff 's the one the customer is upset with '' 
 by the time i get out to the video department there is a small crowd 
 the customer proceeds to read me the riot act about my rude employees who are disrespectful and <unk> to make a deal 
 after he storms off i learned why he was so upset 
 he had demanded that jeff lower the price on a tv 
 jeff 's a bit of a <unk> and after a long day of retail he responded with his own special brand of sarcasm 
 he took the <unk> off the front of the tv set it on the ground and asked the customer : there you go sir is that low enough for you '' 
 i 'm a cashier at a home improvement store 
 i was in the garden booths ringing people out 
 we give veterans 10 % military discount 
 for about a week we 've had a sale on mulch which was 4 for $ 10 
 $ 2.50 each bag 
 it is already at its lowest selling price 
 so i get an older gentleman and he shows me his military id 
 okay cool 
 but wait a second ... all he 's buying is 4 bags of mulch ... the discount wo n't work with it 
 i explain to him why the discount wo n't work and he says what 's the point of being a veteran '' 
 yes sir ... you did what you did to get discounts at a home improvement store ... edit : a word stupid customers 
 i 'm the manager at a sex <unk> store 
 you think working at a porno store would be a fun job it is n't 
 so yesterday some crazy lady comes in and starts yelling at me for selling sex toys i bet your parents are real proud of you 
 rabble rabble rabble 
 i tell crazy lady if she needs any help she needs to tell me 
 she pulls out a black dildo from her purse 
 she slams it down on the counter and screams she wants a refund as she caught her daughter using it 
 i stare at her and tell her we do not accept returns without a receipt and we do not accept returns of used dildos 
 i calmly tell her to take it off my counter as i do n't know where that 's been 
 crazy lady starts yelling that i am going to burn in hell and she wants her money back 
 again i calmly explain i can not accept this item 
 crazy lady goes on a rant about how evil and sad i am for selling these items 
 well that 's all fine and dandy but i do n't really give a damn 
 either buy something or get out as i am not accepting this item '' i explained as nicely as possible 
 crazy lady goes up in arms and starts waving the dildo in my face i want to speak to the manager 
 i smile ma'am i am the manager '' she gets red in the face and then screams she wants to talk to the owner 
 ma'am the owner is a busy man and ca n't always be here 
 i do n't think you would like to see him mad 
 i am sorry ma'am but i can not accept a used dildo '' 
 crazy lady gets mad and throws the dildo at my face and then spits on me 
 god will strike you dead 
 you are a <unk> 
 you have <unk> my daughter by selling her this tool of the devil 
 i shall not leave until i have a refund '' 
 i shake my head no more being nice 
 i politely tell her to get the hell out of my store before i call police 
 we have a very clear no <unk> rule 
 crazy lady <unk> and thinks i 'm <unk> 
 i 'm not i pick up the phone and prepare to call 
 crazy lady runs out the store and thats last i see of her 
 whats worse is today was supposed to be my day off 
 i only came in because my <unk> and other worker decided to conveniently '' call in sick today leaving me as the only one working today 
 so hopefully i 'm okay to post this here it just happened and i know i 've definitely been there in the past so i thought i 'd share 
 i just woke up rolled over to give my boyfriend a <unk> and he still asleep says & gt that 's £1.21 please '' 
 followed by & gt could you leave the store now please '' 
 i could n't help but laugh although in my dreams i find myself swearing at customers and telling them to gtfo rather than actually serving them ... edit : formattingso i work as a cashier at a big box store that shall remain <unk> 
 i 'm planning on leaving at the end of the month would have left by now but i at least wanted to give them two weeks notice so they wo n't be short staffed at christmas so let 's just say i put up with a lot less rudeness from customers than before 
 i 'm still polite and try my best to give good customer service but if a customer 's giving me shit i 'll give it right back 
 today was a perfect example of this 
 i 'm ringing up a well dressed older woman 
 she seemed nice at first and was buying a lot of christmas decorations 
 i was making small talk with her and mentioned how this was my first christmas living with my boyfriend and how excited i was to decorate our apartment 
 this was when shit hit the fan 
 she asked in a cold tone if i meant husband 
 i said no we 're engaged but not married yet 
 suddenly she went on a tirade about how we 're living in <unk> '' because we 're living together but not married 
 i notice that every customer in <unk> is staring and feel myself getting flushed 
 after about a minute of this i 'd had enough 
 i voided her transaction and said i do n't get paid enough to stand here and get insulted like this 
 i 'm refusing you service 
 go to customer service and pay there because i 'm done '' 
 she started to <unk> how dare you talk to me like that 
 call your manager right now 
 i 'll have you fired '' 
 i could n't help but smile 
 i 'm planning on quitting anyway so i really do n't care 
 actually if i get fired i can leave early so you 'd be doing me a favor '' 
 she could tell i was serious and that her threat fell on deaf ears so she stomped off to customer service screaming about what a whore i am nice 
 i was shaking with adrenaline and rage for the next couple of minutes but the other customers in my line reassured me i was in the right and she was a nutcase 
 but man did it feel good to be able to stand up for myself i used to work at a grocery store 
 one day i was stocking shelves and started to work up a sweat so i took my jacket off and hung it over the handle of the cart i had with me 
 so i 'm working and after a bit i see this lady approach me out of the corner of my eye 
 she has n't said anything so i figure she was needing something from the shelf i was working on 
 i turn to look at her 
 me : can i help you with anything 
 that 's when i notice that she was n't waiting for my help but was standing there with my jacket held up in front of her inspecting it 
 customer : is this for sale 
 this struck me as odd because we did n't sell any clothing just food 
 me : oh that 's mine 
 i laughed and held out my hand but she ignored me entirely and continued to inspect my jacket 
 she turned it this way and that and looked at the size tag 
 c : how much is it 
 me : it 's my jacket 
 it 's not for- c : oh i do n't know if it will fit 
 <unk> and frustrated that she is n't listening to me i watch in horror as she goes to try my jacket on when she 's easily twice my size 
 she gets an arm <unk> in and is struggling to make it stretch to put her other arm in 
 and what do i do 
 i step around her and strip my jacket off of her 
 she tries to hold onto it and i jerk it out of her hands 
 c appalled : im going to buy that 
 me : mam this is my jacket 
 a sudden wave of understanding finally <unk> her face 
 she says : oh 
 and then simply walks away 
 wtf.so my last day at my retail job was a few weeks ago 
 i gave my manager my two weeks prior and on my last day i thought i 'd take a look at the schedule to see who 'd be in instead of me the next day 
 huh 
 i 'm scheduled to come in tomorrow 
 that 's not right ... so i call the guy who writes the schedules not the manager they 're different and ask if the manager told him today was my last day 
 oh shit really 
 no he did n't tell me anything 
 do n't worry about it though '' 
 i saw him write it down '' 
 so it turns out that not only did the manager not tell the guy that writes the schedule that day was my last day 
 he did n't tell <unk> it was my last day 
 and then waits until the end of the day to *tell* someone to call in another employee to cover the shift of the job i no longer hold 
 i honestly do n't know how that place makes money with such an idiot manager running things 
 for this story the parts are as so : m : me a poor unsuspecting worker s : customer d : destructor the manager so i was just picking up my photo lab and doing my normal boring duties when i see an order for <unk> pictures come through on the screen 
 rare but not unheard of 
 i work in a fairly well-off city so people have that kind of money 
 at least until i saw they came from one of my kiosks customers use at the store and not from the website 
 red flag 
 the photos started coming out when up walks a young lady that just <unk> snob '' 
 now i 'm not one to judge based on looks but you know the type 
 anyways she waits while i help the person in front of her and by then the printer has gotten out about 100 photos 
 the conversation goes : m : how can i help you today '' 
 s : well i just put in an order and it 's kinda all the pics on my phone '' 
 m : that 's fine miss 
 we can handle large orders 
 it most certainly wo n't be done by the time printed on your reciept though i 'm afraid '' 
 s : that 's fine 
 i was n't going to look through them til tomorrow anyways '' 
 red 
 flag 
 m : look through them '' 
 s : yeah i do n't have a lot of time to waste so i printed them all and i 'll just pick the ones i want tomorrow '' 
 i immediately turned around stopped my printer which was about <unk> pictures in and glared at her 
 m : i 'm sorry but that 's not how this works miss '' 
 s : what do you mean 
 what 's the big deal '' 
 m : the paper 
 the ink 
 the electricity 
 the cost of work 
 it 's not free 
 even if you took a third of those photos my lab would still be out of close to $ 200 in supplies alone '' 
 s : i do n't care how much your company would lose 
 i do n't have the time to waste looking through all my pics tonight '' 
 i feel a disturbance in the force 
 other employees scatter from the backroom 
 the dragon <unk> open the door and breathes fire on all who <unk> her 
 destructor has <unk> again 
 this <unk> lesbian woman is not to be trifled with 
 she has been in personnel seperated from my lab by one wall 
 she has heard enough 
 she stomps over behind the counter and leans on it 
 d : miss i have heard the entire discussion you 've been having with my employee 
 while our company believes in customers always coming first i can not and will not allow you to use our services in the way you want '' 
 s : this is <unk> 
 why do you even care how much company money i waste 
 god '' 
 m : this company pays our bills miss '' 
 destructor glared at me 
 i knew better than to jump in when she 's trying to handle a situation 
 i <unk> out of her line of sight so i did n't explode 
 destructor fixes her glare back on the snob 
 m : miss you have to understand why we ca n't allow you to print over <unk> photos and only take a fraction '' 
 s : i want to speak to your store manager now '' 
 d : it is 8:30 at night 
 he left 4 hours ago '' 
 s : well i want to speak to someone more <unk> than you or your stupid employee '' 
 destructor has had enough 
 she can deal with slurs insults to her weight almost anything 
 she does not do well with insulting employees she respects 
 d : miss your pictures will not be printed tonight nor ever 
 you clearly have no respect for people that make your life easier so we have no business with you '' 
 over the huffs and puffs and stomping and whining and insults the customer aimed at us i hear destructor say the words i knew were coming from the start : cancel the order and <unk> whatever already printed '' 
 this did not please snob 
 she began hysterically yelling and pounding the counter 
 s : this will not end well for either of you 
 i 'll see to it you both are fired after you personally print my pictures for free '' 
 d : you have a wonderful night miss 
 you may print pictures here again when you have some respect for my employee '' 
 as she turns around and walks away with the classic no wonder you morons work here '' line all her ears are met with is the sound of my <unk> <unk> slowly but surely ridding of the things she <unk> most 
 and that my fellow retailers is one of the many times destructor has been <unk> by terrible <unk> 
 all i could do was smile as she wobbled her way back to her lair 
 this happened about 6 years ago and we had a guy come in wearing a long <unk> coat 
 first off this odd attire made security follow him and he walks around the store looking at stuff and does not buy anything 
 the woman greeting at the door she was a very nice woman and everyone in the store loved her 
 she tells the guy to have a nice day as he walks past her 
 the man stops and turns around pulls open the jacket 
 she quickly throws her reading glasses on and loudly says oh how cute but sweetheart i 've seen bigger on a puppy '' 
 she and her late husband used to <unk> dogs the man turned beet red and security caught him 
 called the cops and had him arrested 
 half the front end of the store saw this because she was loud when she said it making heads turn 
 there was much laughter after this happened 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 **story : ** someone else had posted a good story about a shopper showing up at closing time and just browsing 
 it reminded me of this story 
 as you can imagine we get crazy as hell the closer it gets to the 4th of july 
 i try to staff accordingly but of course things never go as you plan them 
 july 2nd should have been a very busy day for us 
 what it actually turned out to be was a madhouse and we did almost twice the business i had <unk> 
 i’m not complaining there were a lot of high fives given that day but after being on my feet for 15 hours i was damn tired 
 we had closed the store at 10pm an hour after we were supposed to 
 i had sent home the cashiers around <unk> since they were supposed to be back at <unk> the next morning and the only people left were my dad one of my employees and me 
 we turned off the lights lowered the sides of the tent and locked up the fence 
 i was walking to my car with the cash drawer when a car pulled up 
 the guy was a regular customer and a friend 
 he was having a party and wanted to grab just a few things 
 i felt bad for him so we unlocked the fence and walked back inside 
 he started running around and grabbing the stuff he wanted while i put the cash drawer back in the register 
 of course two minutes later a group of 5 people walk into the tent 
 i told them we were closed and that they had five minutes to shop figuring that’s about what it would take my friend to finish 
 and then the human tsunami hit… i don’t know where the hell they were coming from but people started pouring into the tent 
 this is a tough situation 
 first i’m there to make money but i was tired as hell i still had to swing by the bank for a drop and i didn’t really have the staff to handle the crowd 
 i sucked it up and started ringing in sales as fast as i could 
 around <unk> i announced to the few remaining shoppers that they had 10 minutes left 
 at <unk> i’m trying to get the last two people out of the damn tent 
 they’ve obviously been partying and they’re just taking their time browsing 
 at <unk> they’re holding maybe $ 10 of stuff in their hands and just laughing and stumbling around 
 i finally can’t take it anymore 
 i walk up to the couple and tell them that we’re closed and that they need to check out now if they want to buy anything 
 the guy immediately gets an attitude and tells me that they’re not done shopping yet 
 i get an attitude and explain to him that yes in fact they are 
 he drops his stuff on the floor in front of me and heads for the door 
 as the couple is walking out a truck pulls up 
 i’m tired hungry and ready for a shower 
 as the guy is stepping out of the truck i don’t even bother to look up and just call out “we’re closed” 
 **guy : ** come on man 
 i want to pick up some stuff 
 **me : ** we were supposed to close at 9pm 
 it’s 11:30 and i’m ready for bed 
 you’ll have to come back tomorrow 
 we open at 8am 
 **guy : ** yeah but it’s going to be busy tomorrow 
 i don’t like shopping when it’s crowded 
 **me : ** it’s going to be a madhouse tomorrow 
 i’d get here early if i were you 
 **guy : ** can’t you just let me get my stuff now 
 a friend of mine told me about your place and said you guys could just put a package together for me 
 i want to spend around $ 1500 
 **me : ** welcome to & lt my company name & gt 
 come on in we’re open 
 -- -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here ten minutes to close a potential customer calls my store : potential customer - hey when do you guys close '' 
 me - i 'm making the rounds now we close in 10 minutes '' 
 potential customer - ok i 'm gon na make it '' 
 and he hangs up on me 
 # 1 - i 'm irritated 
 it 's a saturday i have stuff i have to get done and i 'm just about done cleaning and counting down the register 
 it 's been a slow day 
 i 'm ready to go 
 so i wait anyway 
 at 1 minute 'til i have shut down the register turned off all my signs and i 'm about to lock the door 
 nobody has come in 
 there 's a phone call 
 now i make a habit of not answering the phone at 1 minute until closing 
 there is only one reason anyone ever calls me that late 
 it 's to beg me to stay open 
 no 
 i 'm not a slave 
 you could have been here at any other point in the day 
 and if you cant make it during regular business hours today then come in tomorrow 
 phone quits ringing 
 5pm comes and goes 
 i lock up and go change 
 it 's <unk> and i 'm about to head out the back door to my car when i see a car come screaming into the parking lot 
 a guy runs up to the door 
 sees the lights off and starts violently yanking on the handle 
 it 's locked buddy 
 so i stand there and watch i do n't care if he sees me or not and i watch as he proceeds to bang on the door for two minutes while yelling 
 a rational response to a locked door 
 i do it all the time when i go shopping after hours 
 wait no i do n't do that 
 that 's insane 
 after he 's exhausted himself he just stands there and stares 
 two minutes later he leaves with a disgusted look on his face 
 sorry pal you were late -- not me.i 'm just getting to my shift at fast food restaurant 
 we get a 25 % discount on food 
 so i order a sandwich my manager puts in the discount on 
 at this time a customer comes in and sees that i got a cheaper price 
 i walk behind the counter to go to the back and i hear i want whatever coupon he got pointing at me '' manager at the register still : i 'm sorry sir he is an employee so he gets a base 25 % off our sandwiches because we value their work '' 
 man : well i have to ask what he has ever done except be a waste of space 
 i am a military veteran <unk> unit <unk> and i deserve a discount '' 
 manager : it 's great to hear that you served we have so much respect for those that served but sadly we do n't have such a discount program for veterans 
 if you want you can always call corporate # and suggest such a program '' 
 man : that 's <unk> that you would give that worthless piece of trash a discount when you wo n't even help out a military veteran 
 i will make sure all my friends and all of the veteran 's rights groups of city aware of how you treat the heroes of this great nation '' 
 thank you 
 i work in a grocery store at the customer service desk 
 needless to say that i get at least two customers a day that are pissed about something 
 a regular comes up to the desk one evening with her teenaged daughter 
 i had never had a problem with her before but she was never really friendly either 
 she is looking at her receipt with that look that i hate to see 
 it 's not going to be a simple return or price fix it 's going to be a speech about how we 're literally stealing or <unk> or evil 
 it was actually going to be worse 
 she pulls out a gift card and looks at it 
 we sell all sorts of gift cards most of them you pay 25 $ and get 25 $ credit on the card 
 however the prepaid visa mastercard or american express cards have an additional fee on them 
 it is a bank fee it does not go to our store or even the credit card companies 
 anyway there is a sign by them that informs customers of this charge 
 there is also a sign that says that gift cards are non-refundable 
 she looks at me and asks why did you charge me 3.95 '' 
 i explain to her how it works 
 the whole time she is unfazed 
 i did n't know that 
 you should really tell customers that before they buy the cards 
 otherwise you 're stealing their money '' 
 i should have just agreed but on occasion i get a wild streak in me and feel the need to lash out ma'am it is posted on a sign by the cards '' 
 no it 's not i would have seen it '' 
 alright bitch let 's go take a look 
 i escort her over to the gift card rack and try my hardest to suppress the smug look on my face as i gesture <unk> white style to the sign 
 she is still completely emotionless as she holds the card out towards me 
 i want to return it then 
 i 'm not paying <unk> $ for 25 $ '' 
 i then gesture to the other sign on the other side of the rack 
 her eyes scan the sign and then her face <unk> into an awful <unk> of pure malice 
 she holds it out towards me once more 
 i do n't care i do n't want this card 
 i want my money back '' 
 some people are starting to look over but <unk> her daughter is <unk> in her phone ignoring us completely 
 i inform her that i can call a manager but unless something is wrong with the card they wo n't be able to do anything for her 
 she and i am not kidding starts stomping her foot on the ground and screaming that 's not fair '' 
 over and over in an incredibly shrill voice 
 i hear a manager being paged up and customers and employees are staring 
 her daughter looks up at me for one brief moment and mouths i 'm sorry '' so i assume that this is not an <unk> incident 
 the manager comes up and this lady is still flipping out she 's not shouting anymore but she is still looking at the card for any out and stomping that foot 
 my manager asks what the issue is and the customer is getting tongue tied trying to explain what happened you stole 3.95 $ from me and i want it back i do n't want this '' 
 she is waving the gift card all over the place 
 the manager informs her curtly that we have a no refund policy for gift cards 
 this is not exactly what the customer wanted to hear 
 she throws the card on the grounds and screams like she 's being stabbed 
 everyone is gathering around watching the whole store has gone silent 
 the daughter is still on her phone 
 this lady is like a <unk> 
 i will never shop here again 
 i ca n't believe i fell for this '' 
 she then storms out of the store with her daughter behind her 
 my manager is wide-eyed watching her leave other customers are also in shock 
 i 'm trying not to crack up 
 i pick up the gift card and bring it back to the service desk 
 life goes on 
 about five minutes later who should walk in but the daughter 
 she asks for the gift card which i give to her 
 i ca n't let her leave without asking is she like that a lot '' 
 to which the daughter responds no usually it 's worse '' 
 she goes on to explain that her mom has knocked stuff off shelves spit on people and had the cops called on her twice 
 in fact the reason she did n't do any of that this time was because she had a pending trial for assault 
 lucky us 
 my favorite part of this story and any story in which the customer swears to never return is that she still shops 
 she did n't even give it a week 
 based on what her daughter said maybe we 're the only grocery store that still lets her in ... <unk> cutting my hours once 
 as backstory i had been at that store for years and had seen like five managers come and go 
 i was tired of us going through managers so when this new one we 'll call her bitchy i decided to give her polite <unk> as to where other managers had messed up 
 just simple things like x item sells very well at this store so we should make sure we have enough sundays are actually very busy and we got in trouble for not having enough help those days 
 last manager got in trouble for always <unk> x anything i thought could help her stay a while 
 bitchy always took that the worst way like i was calling her incompetent when really i just wanted her to do well 
 i mean that might be annoying of me but i think it 's clear to see that i meant well and was only trying to save her ass from trouble with the strict store director 
 she hated me 
 we always butted heads and she 's the type of person who if she 's mad she wants to fight it out and make a scene 
 pretty shitty tbh 
 at that job i always felt overworked constantly busy and tired on my days off 
 one day i pissed her off do n't remember what it was something petty 
 so my crazy boss thought i would be <unk> over having a whole weekend off seriously you punish me with a weekend 
 thanks 
 i had to fight to keep my smile from showing 
 bitchy comes up to me shortly after she made the schedule and goes the new schedule 's up 
 you should take a look '' 
 seriously bitch you want to cut my hours and then rub it in my face 
 here we go then 
 i stay <unk> 
 i know i get the weekend off 
 i think i 'm going to do a date night on saturday 
 i 've been wanting to go see this new movie for weeks '' 
 she freezes looks pissed goes ok good then 
 works out for everyone '' and walks off 
 the other employees all start talking about what they 'd do if they had the weekend off movies restaurants activities etc 
 that sound like fun 
 they 're all teasing me asking me to trade them and we 're just all laughing and enjoying ourselves while we work 
 not one hour later she comes back going hey something came up 
 i need you to work saturday and sunday '' 
 i grin even harder 
 ok great 
 i could totally use the extra hours '' 
 and oh my god the look on her face was priceless 
 she realized she could n't win whether she took or gave my hours 
 she spent the rest of the day in a <unk> mood avoiding me 
 it was awesome 
 the best part 
 she did that to a lot of people many who would beg for their hours back so i guess she realized that was a great source of power 
 she tried that on me no less than 3 more times throughout that year every time met with a happy me no matter what 
 it was amazing 
 edit : tl dr : manager tries to cut my hours out of spite instead of being upset i get really excited to have extra days off so she redoes the schedule so i work those days again 
 edit 2 : thanks for the comments everyone 
 you guys have been great 
 a few of you have mentioned that i should apply to be a manager and i 'm really flattered at that 
 i 'm currently about to be trained for a <unk> position my badge will say manager but mostly i 'll be doing <unk> giving breaks and lunches with not a lot of money responsibility and after i graduate i will be more seriously looking into <unk> my career 
 well like my title says i do believe i have found the holy <unk> sought after by retail workers and frustrated parents alike : my friends i have found a <unk> way to make bad children instantly behave themselves 
 allow me to set the scene : it 's a slow evening at the dollar store and a couple walk in with their <unk> daughter 
 right from the get-go this kid is being a bratosaurus rex and her poor parents are just trying to get the things they need and get out of the store 
 five or ten minutes later they come up to my register to check out 
 the little girl is holding a toy that her parents are going to purchase for her but she absolutely refuses to put the toy on the belt for me to scan 
 after much wheedling and <unk> from her parents she finally parts with the toy 
 i scan it put it in a bag and give it to her saying here you go sweetie 
 you can have your toy in your very own bag '' 
 she takes the bag and says nothing 
 here 's where it gets good 
 the dad then says to her are n't you going to say thank you to the lady '' 
 well apparently not 
 the little girl says nothing and <unk> her face in her mother 's skirt but not before shooting her parents and me a look of pure malice 
 you 're not going to say thank you '' 
 <unk> the dad 
 silence once more 
 the mom then goes honey that 's not very polite 
 if you do n't want to say thank you then we can take this toy and give it back to the lady '' 
 the little girl then shouted thank you '' 
 at me with as much <unk> as a <unk> could possibly muster 
 honestly it was hilarious as all hell and had her parents not been trying to parent her i probably would have cracked up 
 but no she was rude and her parents were determined to make her pay the price 
 that 's it '' 
 her dad declared 
 that was not nice of you at all 
 we are definitely giving the toy back '' 
 now granted the kid was being bratty and i wanted her to learn her lesson but i did n't want her to have to give the toy back 
 that 's all right sir 
 she just does n't know about the <unk> up there '' i said pointing at the ceiling 
 he 's always watching '' 
 upon hearing that the little girl 's attitude did a complete 180. she removed her face from her mother 's skirt looked at me with puppy-dog eyes and said in the most polite and <unk> voice thank you '' 
 i smiled at her and said you 're very welcome '' 
 and proceeded to inform her that santa has cameras in all the stores so she 'd better be good wherever she goes 
 as they were paying and getting ready to leave the dad smiled at me and whispered good one '' 
 never before had i managed to get a small child to behave so quickly and i must say that i am quite impressed with myself 
 the funny part 
 we do n't actually have any cameras in our store 
 the thing that i was pointing at was actually the <unk> 
 oh well the kids do n't have to know that 
 : **edit : ** new story is up 
 the destroyer : in which the op is brutalized by a three-year-old hello again talesfromretail 
 my previous story the chicken nugget hooker received so much positive attention that i thought another story was needed 
 about a year after the aforementioned incident i was working the saturday night drive-thru shift again 
 it was fairly busy as saturday evenings tend to be 
 a very shiny rental car pulls up to the ordering microphone and the driver begins ordering 
 he has a very thick french accent and i have trouble understanding him as the microphone is already in terrible condition 
 i ask him to repeat his order a few times 
 he is clearly agitated by the time he <unk> his order 
 a few minutes later he pulls up to the drive-thru window 
 i walk over to take his payment 
 he informs me that he wants to change his order 
 hi my wife does not want number 7 anymore 
 she wants number 3 now 
 change it please 
 also add two milkshakes '' 
 i inform him that i will be happy to change his order but that there will be a small additional wait 
 he mutters something under his breath 
 i ignore the comment and begin making the milkshakes 
 i hear him and his wife conversing in french through the window 
 now i took french in high school 
 i was by no stretch of the imagination a good student 
 madame durand <unk> that i only did enough work to squeak by with a c every semester 
 however i could still make out phrases of the couple 's conversation and sometimes entire <unk> 
 sad excuse for a restaurant ... '' ... stupid white boy should go to university '' 
 they both laugh 
 at this moment i <unk> a brilliant idea 
 i ca n't speak french that well but i can well enough to get the point across 
 i begin recalling <unk> and <unk> from the many hours spent in french class 
 madame durand would have been proud 
 i take the payment for the order hand over the food to the driver and prepare myself 
 as he reaches for the milkshakes i say to him in broken french i hope you enjoy your meal sir 
 it was a pleasure to serve you today '' 
 he looks at me and gets that terrified deer-in-the-headlights look of someone caught red-handed 
 his eyes begin to bulge out of his head 
 my grin is wider than that of a <unk> 
 i 'm afraid that if my smile gets any wider the top of my head will fall off 
 then the best thing that could possibly happen ... happened 
 you know when your eye starts twitching randomly and it just wo n't stop 
 it always happens during a job interview or a date and it 's the worst thing ever 
 my eye started twitching now 
 not a little <unk> where you can hope the other person did n't notice but a full-on <unk> rage twitch 
 my <unk> was threatening to jump off my face and start a life of its own 
 this guy definitely noticed it 
 it was beautiful 
 a great <unk> drama spread across his face as his brain recategorized me from obnoxiously cheerful food worker '' to twitching <unk> whom i just insulted '' 
 this man wasted no time 
 eyes <unk> he made a sound that can only be described as a strangled grunt and slammed the vehicle into gear 
 not one to waste food he seized both milkshakes from my hands and *tossed* them into his wife 's lap 
 her shrieking protests mixed with the <unk> tires on the pavement 
 i never saw either of them again 
 if enough people express interest i can also tell the story of how i was beaten up by a <unk> and sweet 
 i work in one of the big supermarkets in australia 
 i was filling the bread today when i saw a customer sneeze and proceed to blow his nose on a tissue without a second though he dropped it on the ground 
 me : excuse me sir you dropped your tissue '' 
 him : and ... '' 
 me : well are n't you going to pick it up '' 
 him : no is n't that your job '' 
 me : no i do n't see why i have to pick up your snotty tissues if you like there 's a bin less than 10m away behind you '' him : you ca n't talk to me like that let me speak to your manager '' me : i am the manger '' him : well who 's in charge of you '' 
 me : nobody at the moment i 'm in charge of the entire store and everyone in it right now '' him : fine what is your name i 'm going to report you to your head office '' me : <unk> that 's with an m our store number is # <unk> is there anything else i can do for you today '' 
 he let out an audible groan and picked up his rubbish and walked out of the store 
 i 'll be looking forward to how he explains how i refused to pick up his biohazard and to see how i 'll be <unk> for it so this happened just a few weeks ago at my now former workplace hurray better job 
 the company i worked for has expectations for a certain <unk> of all printers having ink attached to the sale 
 associates can get ridden pretty hard by management over their <unk> rates 
 i was doing a circuit of the store looking for customers to help when i saw a man walking down the aisle with just a small printer in his cart 
 i put on my retail smile and paused as he walked past and started on my usual spiel when i see someone buying a printer with nothing else 
 i see you have a nice little laser printer there 
 just so you know those things only have starter <unk> cartridges that print just a fraction of what a- '' the man <unk> around and went bug eyed with an odd expression plastered across his face raised his arms and clapped his hands on either side of his head as he began to shake it back and forth 
 <unk> '' 
 i froze in place and just stared at him for a second before doing a quick 180 and nope 'd the heck out of there 
 it 's probably exactly what he wanted but i 've never encountered that specific approach to avoid having to listen to a sales pitch 
 i will admit that it was quite <unk> i 'm at work and we 're a little less than fifteen minutes away from closing shop 
 i 've got my vacuum out my ipod ready and i 'm overall excited to go home 
 suddenly a women in stiletto boots a *very* short skirt and a belly shirt that does n't leave too much for the imagination waltzes into the store 
 i 'm not going to beat around the <unk> it was definitely a prostitute 
 & gt p : you got green dot 
 & gt me : actually no we stopped selling them not too long ago 
 & gt p : what about vanilla one 
 & gt me : is that like a green dot 
 & gt p : yeah it 's the same thing 
 & gt me : then i really do n't think so ma'am sorry 
 our store stopped selling reload cards 
 we 've been getting a lot of <unk> lately and the store decided it was best to stop 
 honestly i 'd never heard of a vanilla one reload card and what i told her about green dots was n't a lie 
 i genuinely thought if we 'd stopped selling green dots we 'd stop selling all reload cards 
 so then she starts <unk> through all of our gift cards and i come to help her because the faster we find or do n't find this card the quicker she leaves and then i get to go home 
 after a minute or two of searching we do n't find a vanilla one card 
 so then she picks up her phone 
 & gt p : yeah they ai n't got any ... do n't get mad at me ... 
 <unk> ... yeah ... no the store clerk says they ai n't got any ... okay then you come and find them <unk> then 
 she hangs up the phone looks at me and says & gt p : great now he 's mad at me 
 so then this scary ass guy <unk> into my store power walks right to the gift card section grabs a vanilla one reload card whoops ... storms to my counter pays for the card <unk> in cash looks at the woman and says : & gt we about to have a talk outside 
 and then leaves 
 no thank you 
 no good night 
 just takes his card and storms outside 
 so now it 's me and the prostitute again 
 we look at each other for a moment and suddenly she gets a <unk> mad 
 & gt p : great now he 's mad at me 
 you made him mad at me this is your fault 
 and when he 's mad at *me* i 'm mad at *you 
 * what 's your name 
 & gt me : t-t-tanner 
 & gt p : okay **tan-ner** i'mma remember your name **tan-ner** i better not be in trouble **tan-ner** if i am then <unk> gon na have that talk outside <unk> 
 and then she stormed outside 
 at this time all of my coworkers are staring at me a safe distance away 
 they slowly come to me snickering and as one asks & gt what just happened 
 all i can say is & gt i think i 'm gon na get jumped by a hooker after work tonight guys ... fortunately even after closing we have to clean up shop for two hours so if i was in danger they probably got bored after a half hour of waiting and drove off 
 and that 's my tale from <unk> this is the first time posting but i 've read all of <unk> crazy stories over the years 
 as this was happening i knew i had to post it here here goes : i was working as a cashier in the front end of a very popular <unk> <unk> store 
 anyways a customer comes up and asks me if we do cash back 
 i said of course if you swipe your card as a debit card you can get up to $ 100 back 
 she buys a random pack of gum and gets the full $ 100 back 
 it was a busy sunday morning and for some reason my register was out of 20 dollar bills 
 whatever i had plenty of 100 's 
 she could bring it to customer service for them to cash it if she wanted smaller bills 
 so i hand her a 100 and shut my drawer without even thinking twice 
 i was n't expecting her to hand it back 
 crazy lady : uhh ma'am i do n't want this 100 dollar bill '' me : you asked for cash back on your card ... 
 that’s the amount you requested '' crazy lady : yes but this one is dirty get me a different one '' me : that 's not how this works ma'am i ca n't open my register because your 100 bill is ... <unk> ... '' 
 finally after arguing with her for a good 5 minutes and people lining up behind her she went to customer service and they gave her 20 's 
 you should have seen the look on the faces of the customers behind her who watched the whole ordeal go down 
 they were just as flabbergasted as i was 
 i just remembered this from when i used to work at a convenience store 
 we had this promotion where when you buy a coffee before 10 am you get a free pastry 
 decent deal people loved it 
 one morning two guys enter the store 
 one of them gets a coffee the other grabs a red bull and a danish 
 at checkout it went something like this : me : sir i could scan your friend 's danish along with your coffee this way the pastry will be free 
 coffee guy : sudden <unk> look on his face no thank you 
 red bull guy : no man she 's right just let her ring the danish with your coffee and it 'll be free because of that deal they have 
 me : that 's right if you buy a coffee you get a free danish so if i ring the coffee and danish together you only pay for the coffee 
 coffee guy : no thanks 
 i 'm not falling for that 
 me : ... it 's not a trick sir 
 it 's just buy a coffee get a free pastry 
 red bull guy : come on just let her scan the thing 
 coffee guy : shaking his head with a look that says you ca n't fool me '' nah 
 this went on for a short while and coffee guy flat out refused to listen still with this smug look like we 're trying to scam him and he 's not letting us 
 he ended up paying for his coffee and his friend paid for his red bull and danish while shaking his head in disbelief 
 i never quite understood that one 
 edit : <unk> a young professional i 'm oftentimes faced with the occasional client that fails to recognize that despite my age i still know my shit 
 most likely i know my shit better than you and that 's why you 've come to me 
 i work in electronics retail and decided to come out of lurking to share with you the tale of big bob executive 
 a large well dressed man came into my store yesterday with the intention of returning a piece of equipment he won through a contest at work 
 his company purchased the equipment at my store a month prior to the date in question 
 when we make a sale and also printed very clearly on the receipt we inform the client that they have 14 days to return that item for a full refund 
 if the client purchases the equipment with a credit card our only option is to refund their purchase using the same medium they provided for payment 
 bob 's return date as printed on the receipt was for two weeks prior to the date he came to my location 
 i talked with bob and informed him that the date of return had been passed a number of weeks ago and that i would n't be able to process that return for him 
 he asked if i could provide him with anything at all for it and i told him i could return it to our inventory only for a store gift card at this point 
 after all the package was n't opened and i 'm not some heartless bastard 
 he asked me why he could n't simply get his money back 
 i explained to him that it in fact was n't his money and that the equipment had been purchased by someone else a month beforehand 
 therefore the only people i could return that money to even if a manager provided me with an override was the credit card provided 
 i explained to bob how when someone makes a purchase at a retail store they enter a contract of service between the business and themselves the consumer 
 we as a retail location offer them fourteen days to explore and use their purchases for <unk> of returning or exchanging them 
 after those fourteen days the purchaser takes complete ownership of the device 
 now let me <unk> when i said young professional i meant that i appear to be <unk> 
 i am a young 20-something 
 bob executive and his <unk> business associate whom we will affectionately dub mr. jack goff laugh in my face at my response 
 they referred to me as a corporate drone '' that is obviously too young to understand how things work and forces good people into keeping their money inside their corporation by <unk> him a refund 
 and then he said something so disrespectful that for the first time in retail i stopped giving a shit about a customer and what happened to them while they were in my care in my store 
 after giving bob a final answer ergo no i will not be giving you cash for this item purchased over a month ago by someone else '' bob responded verbatim with wrong answer 
 go get me an adult that understands business '' 
 i immediately halted discussion with the customer and went for the <unk> of my favorite manager whom we will dub sarah '' 
 i informed sarah of the situation that the customer was rude and i made it clear that we must hold steadfast in the <unk> i had set for him 
 sarah practically repeated every last word of my explanation which i found irony in given that we 're never taught any process word-for-word so to speak 
 it 's generally left to our discretion 
 sarah was of a similar age so bob and jack goff promptly and blatantly displayed their disgust for children running a retail store 
 he said he 'd be calling our ceo directly to share his distaste for young people running his stores 
 you can feel any way you want about me based on my age gender sexuality skin color i ca n't stop you from any of that 
 but do n't <unk> me because **you** do n't understand how a business works 
 also you could have just sold the fucking thing yourself 
 working for a large chain of electrical retail stores as a salesman manager gets a call on friday saying meeting at hq monday morning be there 
 nothing odd there so monday morning rolls round & amp as the manager ai n't there the asst manager says gimlor go to fast food place & amp get the breakfasts in 
 so off i <unk> 
 place my order & amp whilst waiting the manager wondering up sees my company tie & amp namebadge & amp says sorry you lost your job '' what '' 
 have you not read the newspapers '' 
 picks up a paper & amp shows me a headline on page 5 or 6 of <unk> chain of electrical retail stores to close all staff lose jobs deliver breakfasts & amp bad news 
 manager returns several hours later to confirm we 're all outta work 
 so i work in an autopart store and here in california it finally started to rain 
 this usually means we get a rush of people buying wiper blades and wanting them installed on their car 
 we do this for free because we go the extra mile '' 
 we recently hired two new female employees and they still have n't gotten used to putting wiper blades on so i 'm the only one able to do it 
 we start to get really busy and there 's a bunch of people waiting on me to put their blades on 
 its raining and i 'm getting soaked so i 'm in a not so good mood 
 so i 'm helping this old lady put her wiper blades on and she is thanking me and trying to give me a $ 20 tip which i refuse because we ca n't take tips i would have made a lot of money today but since i 'm one if the supervisors i ca n't accept it 
 she then proceeds to drop the money gets in the car and just winks and waves at me as she is leaving 
 i smiled and picked up the $ 20 bill and waved back 
 that made my whole day 
 tl dr : old lady found a <unk> in our policy to tip me $ 20like a <unk> pan 
 garlic 
 green beans 
 stuffing 
 the list goes a bit more but you get the gist 
 i 'm actually a little amazed that she 's doing this as it 's literally the last minute 
 so ask : why now 
 most people like to get their shopping done early '' she laughs a little 
 because there is no crowd '' 
 which was true 
 it was nearly <unk> at night 
 there was maybe three other people shopping 
 my crew had been dicking around for the past hour as there was nothing to do 
 she went on to explain that she does this each of the two days before and between the two days she usually gets everything she needs and if she does n't well tough <unk> 
 i make some other <unk> and we have that for dinner '' 
 i got ta salute this woman 's 'do n't give a fuck attitude and her will to live <unk> 
 sidenote to fellow grocery store workers : <unk> this the longest possible time until next <unk> was looking after the self serve checkout area when a guy came through and started scanning his basket of items 
 i noticed that he scanned a pair of jeans and put them in his bag although the machine registered the jeans as a pair of socks valued at $ 3 
 i walked over to find that a bar code sticker had been ripped of a pair of socks and placed over the bar code for the jeans which were actually worth $ 35 
 as i voided off the socks and scanned the jeans the customer started to rant that it was false advertising and that he is entitled to get them for $ 3 to which i explained that he was incorrect and i was not going to give it 
 cue a large number of curse words from him and surprisingly some feet stamping 
 it ended with him buying nothing and storming out of the store vowing that he would never return 
 that <unk> lasted 4 days 
 first of all english is my second language so please excuse my mistakes 
 this happened about a year ago a little more 
 this lady called me at my bakery shop and ordered a big stevia birthday cake for about 30 people 
 she was a regular customer and a good one so i did n't ask her to come to the store and pay something in advance 
 now i do n't make these cakes so i had to order it from a partner 
 she was aware of that 
 so on the date we agreed i received the cake paid for it and waited for her to come and pick it up 
 but it was getting late so i decided to give her a call and remind her 
 the conversation went like this : hi ms. b. it 's <unk> from ... – enter bakery shop name 
 your cake is here 
 will you come and pick it up yourself or perhaps you 'd prefer it delivered to your house 
 my husband does deliveries for our regular customers who live nearby 
 i 'm sorry what cake '' 
 the chocolate biscuit stevia cake of 3,5kg you ordered for your birthday '' 
 i 'm sorry but my daughter made the cake for my birthday i did n't order one '' 
 but ms. b. you did call me last week and ordered a cake for today 
 i even said that you did n't need to pay anything in advance because i know and trust you '' 
 at this point she did remember and was in shock 
 oh my god you are right 
 my daughter offered to make the cake a few days after i ordered it and then i completely forgot '' 
 ah that 's ok '' i said waiting for her to mention payment 
 please accept my apology '' 
 of course '' i said 
 well ... goodbye '' she replied 
 omg 
 but ms. b i received the cake and paid for it out of my own pocket '' 
 “well you will just sell it to someone else i guess ” “it’s not easy to sell a cake this big that is also made with stevia 
 you need to pay for it.” “how much is it ” i told her the price and she started crying 
 “oh my god poor me i paid so much money for this dinner party i have today i did n't remember about this cake that’s a lot of <unk> etc 
 she sounded desperate so i just asked her to give me just what i had paid for the cake without my own profit 
 she continued crying with actual tears or that’s what it sounded like because she didn’t like this option either 
 i remember the many “poor-mes” she cried all this time 
 always about poor her and never about the poor cake lady that actually had to pay for the thing 
 at some point i realized that she would just keep crying and would never pay for anything so i did what i consider a mistake now 
 i said : “it’s ok ms. b don’t cry 
 you are a regular customer and i appreciate the support you have given to my business all these years 
 i will try to sell the cake to someone else 
 have a happy birthday” 
 she thanked me many times and said i was an angel 
 i was lucky and did sell that cake for a smaller price of course 
 but guess what 
 i never saw ms. b again 
 i guess she felt embarrassed and didn’t want to see me again 
 but i can’t help but feeling like a fool here 
 i lost a customer after being so nice to <unk> **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 **story : ** josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent although i have to use the term “work” <unk> with josh 
 he’s a tall skinny 19 year old high school dropout who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice 
 his parents are two of my good friends which is the only reason he still works for me 
 when we’re working i spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “where’s <unk> game 
 it’s like “where’s <unk> but usually involves josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or <unk> to the bathroom” for 30 minutes 
 i know that if i’m not watching him there’s a <unk> % chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work 
 josh always owes people money 
 friends family <unk> me the list goes on and on 
 since i’m pretty much his only source of regular income and i only work him about 6 weeks out of the year josh is <unk> broke or in debt 
 last year his mother let me know that josh owed them some big bucks several hundred dollars 
 they were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and josh had drunkenly stolen his <unk> car and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car 
 sadly just another day with josh 
 i talked to josh about it and he seemed embarrassed and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back 
 feeling sorry for him i’m a sucker i let him pick up extra shifts 
 i gave him his paycheck after the first week of work and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back 
 he assured me that he would 
 he then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food liquor and “herbs” 
 his parents were disappointed but not really surprised 
 i gave him hell after i found out what he’d done and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck 
 i’m a sucker not an idiot and i know josh too well 
 from july <unk> on we work a ton of hours since that’s by far our busiest time of the year and <unk> happy when payday arrives 
 i hadn’t forgotten the fast one that josh had pulled with the last paycheck and i mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents 
 on payday i walked up to josh carrying my checkbook and said “is this entire check going to your mom ” he of course assured that it was and danced around like a kid on christmas while i filled out the check 
 i told him the amount folded the check in half handed it to him and thanked him for his help 
 about 20 minutes later i got a text from josh that said & gt you bastard 
 apparently josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party 
 they had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check but the store wouldn’t cash it for him 
 my text response back to josh was : & gt what 
 i asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it 
 per your request i made the check <unk> to your mother 
 thanks again for all the hard work

 -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here when i was doing my time in retail hell people would occasionally ask to use our store phone 
 as a courtesy as long as it was n't long distance we would hand them our cordless <unk> 
 thus sets our stage 
 me = me 
 cb = crazy bitch 
 & gt cb : can i use your phone 
 & gt me : sure here you go 
 i hold out the cordless phone to her 
 she looks at me as if i pulled the pin on a hand grenade and offered it to her 
 & gt cb : no not *that* phone ... i do n't wan na get brain cancer 
 & gt me : this is the only phone we have for customer use 
 & gt cb : what about *that* one 
 she pointed to the phone behind the counter 
 & gt me : sorry ma'am customers are n't allowed behind the counter 
 & gt cb : so you 're not gon na let me use your phone 
 & gt me holding out the cordless phone again : sure i am ... here 
 & gt cb : i already <unk> i do n't want <unk> <unk> 
 i want a phone with a <unk> 
 & gt me : there 's a payphone in the entryway ma'am 
 i pointed to the payphone in the entryway plainly visible from where we stood 
 & gt me : now if there 's nothing else 
 & gt cb : <unk> 
 <unk> 
 & gt me : sorry i ca n't make change unless you purchase something 
 eventually she saw that i was n't gon na give up and walked away feigning disgust 
 & gt me : have a nice day ma'am 
 the manager came in later and asked why i was whistling if i only had a brain '' as i stocked the shelves ... edit : in retrospect if she pushed the change for a dollar '' issue i could have offered her the cellphone for a penny '' deal every electronics store ussd to offer at the turn of the <unk> in my days in retail i worked at a big uk supermarket as a customer services team leader 
 it was a snow day and the uk was n't prepared for snow for the fourth year running 
 we were low on colleagues <unk> 
 low in customers hooray 
 but a high <unk> of those customers are those persistent regulars who are just here to cause trouble oh boy ... 
 so one of the older <unk> gentlemen comes to me at the cs desk and asks for help to get his shopping home 
 he 's just had a hip operation therefore he needs help getting his shopping home 
 luckily the local taxi service was still <unk> as the <unk> were <unk> when driving 
 i pointed him towards the phone to book the taxi so they could <unk> up from the stand as you could only use a booked taxi 
 he refused and this conversation followed : & gt him : no i want you to take me home and into my house 
 & gt me : me 
 what do you mean come with you in the taxi to your house 
 & gt him : no it 's your fault i 'm here shopping when it 's <unk> outside so you have to take me home 
 carry this shopping to my house it 's 20 minutes walk away but it 'll be about an hour in the snow 
 now i do n't quite understand what he 's saying at this point but it sounded like he was blaming me for him choosing to come shopping in the snow 
 & gt him : i 've also just had a hip operation so it 's your duty to make sure i get home safely 
 & gt me : so you 've had an operation and you want me to risk my health to go walk in the snow to get your shopping to your house because you chose to go shopping on a snow day after you 've had an operation 
 & gt him : yes 
 i pay your wages this is part of your job 
 & gt me : no 
 it is n't 
 my service ends at the door 
 you made these <unk> you need to find your way back home the same way you made it here 
 & gt him : you must 
 it 's your fault 
 all of it 
 he started screaming and shouting and <unk> everyone 's attention 
 at this point i just told everyone he wants us to carry his shopping home for him because he ca n't be bothered to walk in the snow 
 this seemed to <unk> the people who decide to get involved 
 after what was an eternity he took the <unk> in the end but i still to this day do n't know how he came to the conclusion that any of this was my fault.hi tfr 
 first post after <unk> year of reading your horror stories 
 i 've been working in a grocery store for over a year now and have culminated my own collection of <unk> <unk> with people <unk> on making everyone around them despise their entire existence 
 <unk> - wall of text below : : : : : warning - wall of text <unk> today i thought i 'd share one that has been in the making for almost a year 
 this story starts with my second day out of training on a register 
 it is currently super doubles '' week where our store will double the value of coupons up to $ 2 meaning a $ 2.00 coupon is worth $ 4.00 for <unk> workers 
 this is obviously very bad for a new employee because the store gets a very bad case of the crazies '' and 1 in 3 customers will actively try to scam you to get away with <unk> or fake coupons 
 management does n't seem to mind however and i 'm thrown on a register still quite nervous about learning 
 -- - **fast forward 4 hours later : ** i 'm approaching the end of my shift i 'm a little more confident and more proficient with the job and have already seen a lot of really <unk> customers 
 i almost feel confident 
 then <unk> comes to my lane 
 barely 5'2 '' of <unk> blonde scraggly hair a gucci purse a torn ragged sweater and bunny slippers 
 yes that 's right bunny slippers 
 it to be referred to as ms. a is an <unk> customer who is <unk> to me at the time <unk> for picking out new employees and scamming them 
 she has picked me out because she spent hours at a time in the store for around a week to see who is new who pays attention to what and who her best option is 
 really if it was n't pathetic i 'd be impressed 
 anyway the transaction goes underway and she being a veteran scumbag gets away with 3-4 coupons off her total 
 i am told this by the customer service clerk csc who reviewed my till 
 it was at that time i vowed to get her back and get her back good 
 i decided to start <unk> not because of 3 to 4 coupons but because of the absolute smug obnoxious glare she shot me when i handed her the receipt 
 a look that says you 're nothing but a cashier <unk> 
 you ca n't even complain about me '' 
 you see i 'm a <unk> sonofabitch and i really do n't like getting taken advantage of 
 as a preparation for my plan i took a picture of the coupons she used with my phone and stashed them back in the folder where they are kept 
 -- - **fast forward 5 months : ** i am now a self-checkout clerk 
 much better at the job now the csc who first told me about ms. a scamming me is a good friend of mine at this point 
 another super doubles week is upon us and ms. a sure enough makes another appearance 
 same slippers same purse same hair 
 i ask the csc if she can make a copy of the transaction ms. a makes by using the customer service desk computer 
 the csc agrees staying that it 's probably a good idea if she ever does get caught 
 ms. a knows not to try going through my line by now as i am experienced so she goes to a newer cashier to try to scam 
 i go to the new cashier 's station to help her bag 
 i do n't say anything about the coupons despite <unk> scamming but i do snap a picture of the coupons and grab a copy of the receipt from the csc at the end of the shift to store away 
 ms. a came in 2 more times that week and repeated the procedure i was able to collect evidence at 1 of the instances 
 -- - **fast forward 3 months : ** i am now a coarse war-torn veteran working as a csc dealing with the worst dregs that society can cough up at me 
 i have now culminated about 13 <unk> transactions that ms. a has pushed through a register at this point 
 my old csc friend is a co-manager at this point and has been in on my plan for a while now and is actively trying to help me catch her 
 during a slow day my friend calls me from the front desk to her office 
 she says she has a plan to deal with ms. a for good : she will ask the security guard who watches self-checkout when the tills are pulled at night to contact the police to be on standby during our upcoming super doubles week 
 i did n't know that it was possible to request that police remain on standby but somehow my co-manager friend did it 
 -- - **fast forward 1 month : ** super doubles 
 i prepare for a rough week of but i want this with this coupon they 're the same thing '' 
 and why did n't this coupon that says 'do not double double '' 
 then it happens 
 ms. a <unk> into the store 
 i hear over my earpiece ms. a is here <unk> tell the security guard '' 
 i do and sit back for the fireworks 
 ms. a <unk> unaware of the world of pain about to be lowered on her slowly scans the shelves for what she wants for over 2 hours 
 she goes to a very new cashier and proceeds to scam the hell out of the poor girl asking to void one item add another scan one coupon clear another item then add another item 
 this is a very simple trick to confuse cashiers as to what they 've scanned and what they have n't 
 <unk> for those wondering : this is fraud and theft 
 do n't do it 
 if you <unk> choose to do it the employees will know your name face and spending habits and you just might end up with an asshole like me who is actively trying to get you arrested 
 ** i make a copy of the register 's actions up front as i always do with ms. a but this time was different 
 as soon as ms. a swipes her card two police officers <unk> walk up to ms. a and ask her to step aside and speak for a moment 
 ms. a obviously distressed yells no 
 leave me alone im doing nothing '' and tries to push past the officers 
 the two officers are not in the business of dealing with her crap and quickly grab her and take her aside bunny slippers in tow 
 her gucci purse still on the counter 
 the purse <unk> <unk> on the edge falls over 
 3 unopened bottles of nyquill and a 16 pack of <unk> batteries roll out onto the desk 
 i could n't contain my laughter and i said aloud fucking score '' 
 and then proceed to close off the cashier 's lane and guide customers elsewhere 
 ms. a. did n't return a police officer came and took the security <unk> my copies of the months of transactions and took a picture of the attempted stolen goods 
 nothing else was said about ms. a. fast forward to yesterday evening 
 my co-manager friend and i are at the front desk she is working in the front office in accounting and i am counting tills from the day 
 she steps out from the office with a grin from ear to ear 
 ms. a just got convicted of theft and some drug charges long jail time from what i understand 
 your transaction records pretty much sealed the case '' 
 holy 
 shit 
 best day ever 
 see i like to think i learned something about the nature of retail and the customer is always right '' 
 it 's just a <unk> game to see who is willing to step in shit enough times to eventually start smelling so bad they ca n't deny it anymore 
 it may not always work but when it does sweet baby jesus it 's like christmas and when they do catch the people who are responsible like ms. a quickly found out they find out that there are no coupons for <unk> 
 **edit : tl dr** do n't coupon scam it 's easy to catch 
 **edit** formatting for <unk> work at a sandwich shop in socal 
 one day i was working phone register which means i handled all the phone orders both taking and ringing them up 
 as protocol states i take the order give them their number and tell them how long it 'll be until their order is finished 
 pretty standard and easy 
 one day an agitated guy comes in 
 ag : i 'm picking up a phone order 
 me : okay sir what was your number 
 ag : she did n't give me a number 
 me : <unk> i absolutely did give him a number i smile <unk> what name would it be under 
 our system has caller id ag : she did n't ask for my name 
 she did n't give me a number 
 she did n't do anything 
 me : ... okay sir can i have your telephone number to look up in our system 
 ag : this is ridiculous 
 i just want my order 
 it took everything in me not to say well if you had listened to me when i gave you your number this would n't be an issue '' but i did n't 
 i just love my <unk> few years ago i went into a large chain store a mart of if you will 
 i do n't recall what i was there to buy but it was nothing significant so i did n't grab a basket or shopping cart which ended up being a mistake 
 as i walked through the isles i was flagged down by a women in a motor scooter who asked me to reach something on the top shelf 
 that 's normal right 
 i 'm a tall guy and she 's <unk> i did n't even think of her asking 
 as i handed her her item she asked me where the asprin was oh its actually in the next isle '' i responded once again thinking nothing of this women asking for help 
 i walk away and make it about twenty feet before a second person approaches me to ask where the batteries were located 
 i was puzzled as to why he had assumed i would know but i actually did know so i told him and went on my way 
 a few minutes went by until i was yet again approached by someone who wanted to know where something was 
 me : hey can i ask you something 
 why are you asking me where to find things 
 person : fuck you then i 'll find it myself 
 at this point i 'm puzzled 
 i just want to get my items and leave 
 you probably already know what happens next 
 someone stops me and begins to ask a question before i interrupt listen i 'm sorry i ca n't help you i just want to get my things and go '' the elderly gentlemen who i interrupted responded with oh did your shift end 
 that 's fine '' as he walked away 
 my shift 
 what did he mean my shift i did n't work there i could n't even imagine why he 'd assume so 
 i 'm now nearly sprinting trying to finish my shopping before someone pulls me away again 
 just as i think i 'm in the clear i hear hey '' i turn around to me greeted by a portly man with an authoritative tone i assumed he was another customer until i noticed his badge which said his name and the word manager '' in bold 
 hey uhhh clearly trying to place a name to my face you forgot your name tag and also can you get register six 
 judy just took lunch '' 
 to clarify this man did not glance at me and say this he was looking right at me right at my astonished face 
 i responded with an open mouthed stare like i had just been <unk> 
 he evidently sensed my confusion as he repeated himself while grabbing my shirt and pointing at the checkout 
 it was n't until then that i noticed what i was wearing a blue polo and khakis the outfit of the employees at said store 
 i wish i could tell you that i manned the register or otherwise took advantage of my active camo but i did n't i left the store as soon as possible with a half hour wasted and empty handed 
 moral of the story : the type of people that do n't notice signs are the same people that do n't notice the lack of a logo and name tag on my shirt 
 the manager 
 he was in a hurry and it was a big store an with a lot of employees my age maybe he thought i was in training or <unk> boss at the flower shop has been on vacation way too long 
 i 've been covering weekends for him and coming in to help out as much as possible during the week 
 things have totally fallen apart without him there 
 it also does n't help that we are severely understaffed to begin with 
 today was my last saturday working for a while 
 hooray right 
 nope 
 it was a total cluster f @ & amp <unk> i was screamed at whined at and had things thrown at me 
 sigh but then right before we were going to close two women came in 
 i went up front and did my spiel 
 the younger woman 's mother was in the hospital & amp they wanted flowers for her 
 i got an idea of what they wanted & amp went to work putting some arrangement together for them to take 
 when i brought the arrangements out to the sales floor it happened ... they gasped at how pretty they were 
 i never get to see people 's reactions like that 
 i told them how much i appreciated their reactions and we had a big fuzzy warm moment 
 i was called to see something in the back and met an older lady with a cane asking for help 
 i wanted to pawn her off to a toy department employee but it turned out just to be getting something off a shelf 
 back where i am someone wanted to talk to a manager so i took the call 
 its the elderly lady and she apologizes for being a pain 
 put on the best retail smile and say i 'm happy to help whatever you need 
 turns out we 're running a promotion you need a mobile device for 
 she 's old and has a pay as you go phone she ca n't do those things 
 she just bought 100 dollars worth of stuff for the grandkids 
 i tell her to give me a few minutes 
 just want to check the details of the promotion/how much she 's deserved 
 she keeps telling me the <unk> of being old 
 i 'm sympathetic and let her know i 'll be refunding her the 25 % 
 she really appreciated it and insisted on thanking me by buying me something 
 i honestly told her if i made her day better that 's enough 
 she said she wo n't leave without a hug 
 so we hugged it out 
 first time i hugged a customer 
 our store is near several group homes for people with mental disabilities or problems 
 consequently we see every kind of behaviour 
 one of our now regulars came in for the first time and had interesting requirements to make him happy 
 he was very <unk> to being touched so i had to lay his change out on the counter for him to pick up 
 fine i 've had people ask that before 
 but this was something new 
 twitchy customer : okay okay okay now gim me my change but here thumps counter me : okay you have two dollars sixteen cents ... i begin to lay the money on the counter remembering another customer who is very ocd and has to have her money <unk> properly twitchy customer : no 
 stop 
 one at a time 
 me : oookay ... here 's one dollar ... here 's two dollars 
 twitchy customer : no 
 you have to acknowledge it 
 me : what 
 twitchy customer : acknowledge it 
 acknowledge my money 
 i had no idea what he meant so i waved my hand over the money on the counter and said solemnly i acknowledge thee '' 
 twitchy customer : thank you 
 i did that for ever coin i laid down he 'd nod and thank me 
 to this day he comes in and is very pleasant as long as you acknowledge his money 
 update : wow thank you for all the comments and upvotes people 
 this is only the second time i 've posted so it 's nice 
 may i even say i feel <unk> 
 : i work in a relatively popular department store with an extremely lenient returns policy 
 my main area is in the home store but i pick up shifts in clothing as well 
 so i was working in the plus size department one night and a lady comes up with a bag of burt 's bees <unk> 
 cosmetics and i had no idea we even sold these 
 she tells me her grandmother she was way too old for that though <unk> is a <unk> / impulsive shopper who bought all of the burt 's bees online and that she was coming to return them for her 
 i normally do n't take back anything but clothes and occasionally home items in a clothing department but she had waited in line a long time for me so i was going to take it 
 after all she could 've been completely legitimate 
 i have had people doing the same thing albeit with clothes and they had literally every form of proof of purchase 
 receipts her card everything 
 so i open up the return window and i ask her if she has a receipt 
 mind you she did n't bring them in typical packaging 
 this was just a regular mesh kind of bag not even a shopping bag 
 she says no 
 okay no big deal 
 there 's like 500 ways to return something 
 so i ask if she had her grandmother 's card that she purchased the items on 
 she then says no she paid with cash 
 oh yeah 
 with cash 
 on an online order 
 yeah 
 i sent her to cosmetics 
 i was n't dealing with her 
 edit : oh the upvotes 
 this is my most up <unk> post 
 thanks guys : so i do online chat for a retail store 
 we have all previous chats automatically save and pop up when a new one starts 
 it 's helpful 
 cuts chats in i wan na use x promo on y item '' me 
 unfortunately that particular brand is excluded 
 i 'm really sorry about that 
 cust the person i just talked to said that it works 
 so you have to honor it '' honestly we usually do honor most of them 
 it was 10 % off a cheap jacket 
 but i have to check and see if we really did say we would honor it 
 so i pull up the chat and the cust is asking a bunch of specific questions on items we sell 
 never asked about a promo at all 
 me 
 actually sir i 'm looking at your previous chat with coworker and i 'm not seeing that promo mentioned anywhere in the conversation '' immediately ends the chat 
 it was beautiful 
 a few years ago i worked in a coffee shop as a barista 
 we opened at <unk> to tackle the never ending london morning rush hour 
 i would start work at <unk> preparing pastries and stocking the fridges and coffee machine 
 one morning i 'm under the counter stocking up one of the milk fridges it 's about <unk> i stand up and there 's a lady standing there 
 she must have pushed the automatic doors open in order to gain entry 
 lady - i 've been standing here 5 minutes you 've been ignoring me '' 
 me - erm ... we 're not open for another half an hour i was n't expecting customers '' 
 lady - this is ridiculous how dare you ignore me i 'd like a croissant and a latte '' 
 me - as i said we 're not open i was stocking a fridge under the counter so i did n't see you '' 
 lady <unk> this is unacceptable please get your manager '' 
 cue our <unk> <unk> manager who after hearing her horror story and giving her plenty of <unk> <unk> and <unk> thrusts a croissant into her hands and sends her on her way 
 my only retribution was that if she ever came back into the store again i refused to serve her.i work in a supermarket in the uk on the deli counter serving cold meats cheese <unk> what have you and quite often in the quiet times of the day there 'll be just one of us serving whilst others are on lunch or counting stock 
 this was one of those occasions 
 sometimes when there are a few customers waiting at different parts of the counter it 's hard to know who was first but i trust my judgement 
 just after i finished serving someone some <unk> i walked up to a gentleman at the end to serve him when i suddenly hear <unk> me 
 in the rudest tone 
 i ask her what she wanted and she demanded that she was next 
 i said 'i 'm sorry but i 'm pretty sure this gentleman was next and she demanded i serve her 
 the man was very understanding and told me i was fine to serve her 
 she was after some beef 
 so i sliced it for her and she went on her way 
 i went back to the man and apologised profusely for what happened whilst serving his cheese 
 he then looked at me and with the <unk> face and responded <unk> 's okay 
 i hope she chokes on her beef and then he walked away 
 cue me and the customers who had witnessed this bursting into hysterics 
 this man is a legend 
 thinking about it though ... .. i have n't seen her in store since it happened ... tldr : woman pushed in line man may have cursed her by hoping she chokes on her beef 
 have n't seen woman since presumably the beef got her 
 so in this tale i 'm a customer 
 i do n't have a drivers license 
 long story but kids pay your speeding tickets on time 
 i do have a state issued id in it 's place 
 the exact same requirements to get a state id are the ones you have to get a drivers license and they 're supposed to be accepted as a form of id for any purpose 
 i 've had my state id for 3 years and have never had an issue with it until today 
 i was in the grocery store i commonly frequent buying today 's dinner supplies and some beer 
 when the cashier got to the beer they asked for id i 'm <unk> so i still get <unk> about 1/2 the time and i hand over my state id 
 they stare at it like they 'd never seen one before 
 cashier : um do you have a drivers license 
 me : no i have this state id 
 it 's the same thing 
 they call a manager over who barely glances at the id before informing me that it was against the law for them to use it for liquor purchasing purposes 
 here 's the deal : i 'm a bartender 
 i know what the liquor laws say about ids you can accept for buying booze 
 i have a big poster behind my bar showing the appropriate ids 
 and state ids are 100 % acceptable to buy booze 
 i inform the manager of this and they literally just turn their back and walk away from me while i 'm in mid sentence 
 so i 'm pretty steaming now and after i finish my purchase minus the beer i go to the customer service desk and ask to speak to another manager 
 of course the original one i spoke to is the only one there so i leave go home and write an email to their corporate office explaining what happened 
 if it 's their store policy fine though that 's a weird fucking policy 
 do n't lie and tell me it 's the law when i know exactly what the law says 
 i 'm more than happy to take the $ 250 a month i spend on groceries to a competitor who will treat me respectfully and sell me my sweet sweet <unk> long time lurker first time poster 
 i work at a fairly large cinema complex and this happened whilst i was working on floor this week 
 i was cleaning the bathrooms during a quiet period and was standing literally in the doorway of the bathroom when this lovely interaction happened 
 m for me ic for the <unk> <unk> customer 
 ic - is this fantastic four 
 m - no ma'am this is a toilet 
 ic - the girl on <unk> said the first door on the right 
 is this not the first door on the right 
 m - ma'am this is a toilet a bathroom 
 ic - so fantastic four is n't in here 
 m - only fantastic number twos 
 ic - so where 's fantastic four 
 m - first door on your right directly behind you 
 tl : dr customer does n't know the difference between a toilet and a cinema 
 there are many things our techs find in tires when doing a tire repair at our store this is probably the <unk> thing they have ever seen come into the shop 
 a woman pulled up and requested us to look at her tire because it was making alot of noise after she ran something over in the road 
 well we write up a work order and she heads into the waiting area while we get to work 
 simple tire order nothing unusual we see these all the time 
 well we put the tire on the lift and as we move it in we see the offending object looked like a piece of metal and it was still <unk> in the tire 
 we lift up the car and rotate the tire to a better angle to look at it because we need to know what were dealing with 
 one of the techs who is working on it hollers holy crap i ai n't touching this 
 the supervisor assumed that the tech was saying there was a <unk> issue with the vehicle so he came over to look and started laughing like a mad man 
 well i go over to get a better look at what 's causing this commotion 
 turns out there is a metal dildo in this womans tire 
 we all in the shop are laughing real hard over this and we have to get this thing out of the tire to assess the damage 
 well we ended up using a pair of pliers to get this offending toy out of the tire 
 well in the long run unfortunately were not able to do a repair as the punctured area was not able to be fixxed 
 well we have to notify this woman she needs a new tire and we have to show her the reason 
 we tell our supervisor he has to give her the bad news and show her the reason it needs repaired 
 he calls the woman out to the shop area to speak to her in private because he did not want to just go inside in front of other customers and <unk> out i am sorry ma'am but a dildo <unk> your tire in an area so badly it can not be repaired 
 well apparently he did not tell her what it was because i can hear her say well what the hell punctured my tire 
 well he brings her to the edge of the shop and he grabs a pair of nitrile gloves and grabs the pliers to grab the toy to show her 
 the woman upon seeing this mangled item begins to <unk> in laughter 
 the supervisor was mortified showing this to her and was red as a <unk> 
 needless to say the woman purchased a new tire and we all had a good laugh over this ordeal 
 edit : the dildo was crushed a bit on the back end of it that is how it got the tire for those who were wondering it was not a solid piece of metal 
 the rest of it was messed up a bit i assume from being caught in the tire and somehow not getting thrown off by a rapidly rotating wire 
 as for location there is a nearby airport and there are a few areas nearby that are big draws for <unk> so where this came from no clue and do n't wan na know 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax with the 4th of july and new years eve 
 <unk> : ** welcome to the week of scam artists 
 they rarely get away with it but that sure does n't stop them from trying and occasionally winning 
 you know it’s going to be a long day when the guy wearing the dark suit and standing in front of you pulls out his secret service identification 
 most of the people who buy fireworks from me use credit cards 
 i’m actually pretty happy about that 
 even though i have to pay fees on each transaction it <unk> the possibility of theft and i don’t have to deal with as much cash 
 believe it or not most banks now charge you a fee if you deposit more than $ <unk> in cash to your account during a single billing period 
 yep it’s bullshit but if all banks are doing it what’s your alternative 
 that being said we still receive a fair amount of cash during the course of our sales season and i do everything i can to reduce my risk 
 my cashiers all use money pens to check the large bills we try not to keep a lot of cash in the register <unk> and our friendly local police escort me to do cash drops at the bank when needed 
 overall we’ve had very few problems 
 **story : ** one of my cashiers called me over because the $ 100 bill she was holding didn’t look right 
 the paper seemed right and it passed the pen test but the printing on the bill did seem a little off 
 the lady who had paid with the $ 100 bill was getting impatient and in the end i just assumed the bill was old and worn we do see that a lot 
 apparently the night deposit i made on the 4th of july had several of the bills 8 to be exact 
 guess who showed up at my tent on july 6th to discuss it 
 the agents were actually very nice 
 they couldn’t give me many details but apparently the woman who had passed the bill was no stranger to them 
 i’m not sure if she had made multiple purchases at my store each with a <unk> bill or if she had <unk> 
 i gave them my statement but i honestly didn’t have much to tell them 
 the agents did say that the bills were actually very high quality and that we were lucky to have noticed anything wrong 
 i didn’t feel very lucky 
 in the end i was scammed out of $ 800 
 <unk> the lady who scammed me : ** i have a container of explosives and a very particular set of skills skills i have <unk> over a very long career 
 skills that make me a nightmare for people like you 
 if i see you in my shop again… 
 -- -- - if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here and here 's a scary til about where some of these <unk> come from.so i work in the dairy aisle in a supermarket 
 it 's a good job usually and like any supermarket job there are people that will come up and ask if you have a product 
 in this case we would tell them where it is and then just continue with our day 
 but sometimes people know where a product is and they just want to be a dick to the the staff which i 'm sure you all know about 
 case in point idiotman walks up to me asking about bread 
 now for this to make sense you need to understand a few things 
 the supermarket i work at is a regular <unk> supermarket near a small arcade area 
 now in this arcade area there are a couple of shops a <unk> a patisserie and a <unk> 
 ** if you want to go to the bakery you have to walk out of the store and then work literally ten meters to your left where the bakery is 
 anyway idiotman walks up to me and says hey you come hear '' in that rude voice which means something has happened to him that is inexplicably my fault 
 i walk over to him and he is pointing at the <unk> area where all the new bread rolls we get everyday are kept 
 idiotman is giving me <unk> eyes and he starts shouting whilst pointing at an empty shelf of 99 cent rolls i come here everyday and you 're always out of these fucking rolls '' 
 along with other complaints including how he works such a hard schedule and he <unk> a roll which fate has somehow <unk> <unk> him out of 
 now i am a bit flabbergasted at this man 
 there is nothing i can do to get him more bread rolls because they are only delivered once a day but more importantly there is a bakery right next door where he could probably get a cheaper and <unk> bread roll 
 my go to response is the usual sir i 'm sorry i ca n't help you but i can get you the manager if you would like '' 
 but alas idiotman is a veteran in the field of being a dick to staff and obviously understands that if someone with authority tells him leave there is not much he can do about it 
 he tells me that i have to deal with the situation for some <unk> reason but i do n't want to be rude plus it is apparently my moral duty now to ensure this man gets his bread 
 so i say politely sir there is not a lot i can do about the situation have you considered going to the bakery next door 
 unfortunately for me idiot man is offended by common sense and so now he <unk> me to get the manager so he can tell him how inappropriate it is to tell a customer to shop elsewhere '' 
 which according to idiotman is what i was doing 
 so i go get my manager who is awesome and tell him that some man wants a bread roll which we are out of and is angry because i told him to go to the bakery 
 my manager comes back to the man with me and asks what the problem is 
 idiotman tells my manager you are out of these fucking bread rolls and your staff member has been very rude to me '' 
 my genius boss looks at him wide eyed and out of nowhere <unk> to the front of the store 
 idiotman and i follow and as we reach the entrance we see my manager standing in the doorway looking at the bakery 
 for about a minute he stands in the doorway staring at the bakery and then looking back at the man back and forth and back and forth with utter confusion on his face 
 eventually he turns to idiotman and asks sir you know there is a bakery right next door right '' 
 i only kept it together long enough for the man to drop his basket and storm angrily out before losing my shit 
 edit : thanks everyone i 'm definitely going to show all your comments to my boss next time i 'm at work i was checking through a woman who was frantic about getting a 30 % off discount 
 we do have coupons but the only ones that are valid this months are ones where you have to donate used items to a charity we partner with to get them 
 she physically jumps in front of her husband to stop him from putting items on my till 
 & gt customer : is there 30 % off today 
 & gt me : sorry there 's no sales today if you have a coupon for <unk> i can take that 
 she <unk> through her purse the husband starts putting up items and she grabs every second or third one 
 holding it up to me she proclaims the price and <unk> & gt customer : is this on sale 
 & gt me : no there are no discounts today 
 & gt customer : is it 30 % off 
 she points to various promotional signs that hang around and i again explain that those do not <unk> a sale 
 they pertain to things like seniors day and the charity we partner with 
 a line up as formed behind her as she searches for a coupon we all know very well she does not have 
 she could n't be over 40 and she asks & gt customer : well do you have a seniors day discount 
 my internal reaction is annoyance lady stop asking me for discounts after i 've specifically answered multiple times that unless you have a valid coupon you are not getting a discount 
 i of course did n't say anything but the line forming behind her did 
 they decided to <unk> in laughter at this young woman asking for a seniors discount 
 it 's so funny to them 
 she gets the <unk> to keep repeating the question to me ... as i 've posted before i work at a board game store in a mall 
 we have a metal stand that goes in the hallway that holds our <unk> which are kind of flimsy 
 the metal stand does n't sit evenly on the floor meaning it <unk> when you bump it 
 this teenage girl was standing on it and <unk> it back and forth 
 meaning it was making a loud noise she was also <unk> the actual sign as well as the metal stand 
 so i walked over and asked her to please stop 
 i was going to ignore the damage since the thing was kind of <unk> in the first place 
 her mother went off on me and told me that she was the mom and i wasnt and to stop trying to control her daughter 
 so i asked her if she wanted to pay for a replacement about $ 100 for the actual stand and $ 30 for the board as both were now beaten pretty badly 
 she asked to see the manager she was pretty upset when i told her i am the manager 
 i did n't actually make her pay for it i just wanted her to stop bitching at me 
 back when i worked at a <unk> coffee shop in the us i wound up with a lot of really interesting stories to share but the one that comes to mind is when some guy came through our drive-thru and ordered a mocha 
 now this was n't any old <unk> no he needed some extra sugar i do n't judge so he said to me over my headset can i get like a <unk> of chocolate in that '' 
 he started laughing no doubt at the fact he used foul language during the <unk> interaction ... a social <unk> i do believe 
 without missing a beat i respond in perfect deadpan voice sir i 'm going to murder that motherfucker with chocolate '' 
 my entire shift turns to me and looks like i 'd just read a page off of the <unk> all while the guy at the ordering box is bursting with uproarious laughter 
 my managers give me a verbal warning but it was pretty clear that i 'd made the guy 's day so they did n't take any real '' action against me 
 <unk> however whenever i worked the espresso bar they would tell me hey can you go murder some drinks while person is on lunch '' 
 **tl dr- i am the <unk> 
 <unk> summer i worked as a cashier at target 
 easy job dealt all walks of life and a pretty typical summer job 
 one customer really left an impact on me though in a way i would have never expected 
 a pack of <unk> lip balm and a soft drink was all he was purchasing 
 when i looked up to see the man behind the selections a tall <unk> figure with a legendary mustache and a chipped front tooth greeted me 
 the bundle of facial hair was extremely thick brown with spots of gray and obviously something he took an enormous deal of pride in 
 my first instinct as it usually is with anybody who has exceptional facial hair was to compliment the man on his work of art 
 he replied by thanking me and explaining how he hadn’t shaved it since <unk> when i asked why he responds <unk> in <unk> my best friend told me <unk> you ever die i’m never <unk> this here <unk> 
 we were always competing against each other so i told him <unk> motherfucker you got a deal.’ three days later i saw him get shot in the head and this has been untouched ever since.” i was completely taken back obviously and after a few seconds told him that was very honorable 
 to which he replied “no that’s war ” took his change and left never for me to see him again 
 biggest badass ever.i was working cash and things were going normal 
 totally fine 
 it had been a great day 
 the store was starting to slow down and there were only two people left in my line 
 awesome 
 i finish bagging this older gentleman 's like late 40s 50s groceries and he pays 
 & gt me : i 'm just gon na put your receipt in your bag alright 
 no one ever says no to this so i start to put it in 
 someone grabs my hand to stop me 
 & gt oldergent : hey 
 do n't you know those things cause cancer 
 & gt me : <unk> ... <unk> 
 & gt oldergent : well they do 
 you should probably wash your hands after handling them 
 & gt me : <unk> ... okay 
 will do 
 the customer behind the older gentleman and i exchanged glances as he left 
 he did n't take his <unk> i was running a till and it was extremely busy 
 customer comes through my till with her groceries long line behind her 
 i scan them and get to the end 
 me : your total is $ xx.xx 
 customer hands me a card 
 me : is that a debit or credit card 
 customer looks at me like i 'm stupid and says : credit 
 it 's a visa card 
 me : okay 
 credit it is 
 i then tap her card and hand her back her card and her receipt 
 customer : oh i should get cash back on the order so i can have some cash 
 she stands there looking at me 
 me : your order is finished 
 i 've processed it on the card you gave me and i handed you the receipt 
 customer : how did you do that 
 oh right the tap 
 this is ridiculous 
 i wanted cash back 
 you should have told me you were going to tap my card 
 me : just take your receipt and card to the service desk 
 they can refund your order on your visa and then process it on debit for you to get cash back 
 customer : i ca n't believe this 
 this is so stupid 
 this is your fault 
 customer walks away in a huff to the service desk 
 yeah it 's my fault 
 what was i thinking processing your order on the card that you gave me this is a bit of a success story rolled in with one of the most <unk> experiences i 've had in retail 
 it 's long so bear with me 
 a little background : i am very timid and a bit of a pushover in certain situations 
 if possible i avoid situations rising to confrontation but can generally remain calm during stressful situations if i need to be 
 i 'm working at the service desk on a relatively easy night at the store where i work 
 another woman who had been covering the desk with me is on her break leaving me by myself 
 not that big of a deal 
 up rolls this 60-something woman in an electric cart and i feel it in my bones ... this is not going to be easy 
 she puts a clearance jacket on the counter 
 i ask if she 's purchasing the jacket since it 's the service desk the main focus is -- of course -- handling returns and exchanges 
 she looks at me like i 'm the least intelligent person she has ever encountered in her life 
 cl : what else would i be doing with it 
 me : generally this desk is used for returns and exchanges but if you 're purchasing i can absolutely do that for you 
 i ring up the coat and tell her her total 
 she goes to hand me a card but i point to the card reader telling her to run it through the side 
 cl : i ca n't 
 it 's a gift card 
 me : since it 's a visa gift card and not a store gift card you run it through the machine 
 she swipes the card 
 me : do you have a pin set up 
 by this point i 'm being perfectly pleasant and trying to help her through the process as best as possible knowing it can often be confusing for older people 
 cl : i just told you 
 this is a gift card 
 you ca n't have a pin for these things 
 me : you *can* actually call the company and have a pin set up so you can run it as a de- cl : no you ca n't 
 there 's no pin 
 me : okay 
 and we all know this okay '' 
 it 's the okay crazy bitch '' that you 're not allowed to actually say out loud so you stop at okay '' 
 me : press the red x then press credit on the next screen 
 you 'll need to sign for it 
 she does as i tell her and when she finishes my register tells me that she still owes a little more than three dollars after the remaining balance from the gift card was applied 
 i inform her of this and she proceeds to pull out two $ 3 off with our apologies '' coupons that we give to people who experience inconveniences at the fault of our store 
 me : oh 
 those are actually coupons which need to be applied before the payment 
 so in order to use those i would have to void out the card payment and ... cl : you ca n't do that 
 the money wo n't go back on the card right away and i wo n't be able to use it 
 you 're stealing my money 
 now i know some people use caps and <unk> points in a bit of a <unk> to make the situation seem more extreme than it really is 
 however my supervisor nh for not helping was standing easily thirty yards away from the desk with two sets of shelves in between us and the very second cl started yelling nh 's head pops up above the shelves while she gives me a the f**k is going on '' 
 look 
 i try to very calmly despite already starting to get shaky at the thought of the oncoming <unk> about to rain down on me explain to her why things wo n't work the way that she wants to and that no i ca n't make the register work the exact way you want it to work '' 
 nh comes over to try and defuse the situation but she has terrible <unk> skills and only manages to make cl even more upset 
 cue other customers actually stopping to <unk> and our small-but-fierce sbf security girl coming over to interject 
 sbf : ma'am if you could please just ... cl : no 
 nobody asked you to enter this conversation so i 'm not even talking to you 
 this cashier stole my money and is trying to screw me over 
 this mistake needs to be fixed right now 
 nh calls our store manager up to the service desk 
 at this point the situation has been going on for at least 35 minutes 
 sbf is standing behind me legitimately concerned that she will dive over the desk and <unk> this woman if given a direct path 
 as the other service desk employee has yet to come back from her meal break we could n't help any other customers during the entirety of the exchange 
 our normally calm and collected cac store manager comes over 
 i start to explain the situation but cl cuts me off yelling to the store manager that i stole her money 
 i am literally shaking 
 cac approves for us to void the payment and use the coupons to bring the price down to what can be covered by the balance on the card 
 he then walks away 
 i do as he says we apply the coupons and try to run the card 
 of course it is decline 
 cl : this is exactly what i told you would happen 
 i *told <unk> not to do that 
 me through gritted teeth : *i* am only doing what my supervisor instructed me to do 
 this is how coupons work ma'am and this is how they work just about everywhere 
 coupons as i 've already told you need to be applied before we accept any payment 
 she flips 
 her 
 shit 
 nh over <unk> : cac back to the service desk 
 sbf : dipity90 take a step back 
 cac comes back 
 me : the card got declined but ... cl : this idiot just stole my money 
 cac : hey 
 this is a 35 mile an hour zone and you 're cruising at about <unk> so i 'm going to need you to ease off the <unk> 
 and at this moment everything stops 
 1. no one has ever heard cac raise his voice before 
 2. he just ... said ... what 
 cl sounding legitimately shocked and insulted : why would you speak to me like that 
 cac : there is not a person here with ears who appreciates your tone 
 these are human beings you are speaking at '' 
 cl : this girl stole my money 
 i ca n't use it now 
 cac : i will personally had you twenty dollars out of this register to leave this store and never come back and hopefully never go to any other <unk> with this kind of attitude ever again 
 somewhere in the middle of the yelling the other service desk employee has come back and slowly figures out what is going on 
 she calls the card company and the automated number tells her that the remaining balance is still the <unk> that cl thinks is missing from her card 
 cl is now offended every way from sunday but set on buying this jacket but i 'm never shopping here again '' 
 we manage to get the transaction to go through 
 i hand her the receipt with no hint of <unk> in the interaction 
 then ... oh dear goodness ... then ... cl gets pleasant 
 cl : <unk> i think i might have gotten the wrong one 
 could you tell me what size it is please 
 me : no 
 cl : excuse me 
 i asked you for help 
 me : and i am refusing 
 you do n't talk to me 
 ever 
 again 
 sbf : nh i think dipity90 might need an extra five minute break 
 me : dipity90 does need an extra five minute break which she will be taking *outside* and she will remain outside until all <unk> <unk> have left the service desk 
 i ripped the service desk keys off my belt and the walkie head set out of my ear only barely refraining from throwing them down 
 cac : dipity90 also probably needs a free drink from <unk> 
 i 'll go over with you and get you one 
 crazy lady tries to argue with the people remaining at the desk but everyone ignores her 
 she then proceeded to go back into the store to do more shopping despite having just promised us to never shop there again 
 tl dr : lady goes batsh*t crazy because she does n't know how coupons work and manager <unk> situation with the gem in the <unk> this is a long complicated story 
 i figured you guys would understand it the best because most of you work with <unk> card payment terminals 
 any who i work in a high end optical store 
 we have frames that sell for over $ <unk> so naturally we attract a scum or two 
 the other day a young guy came in early 20 's looking to buy a gift for his girlfriend 
 okay no problem 
 i let my coworker tend to him while i went on my lowly inventory duties 
 a few minutes later and he 's asking to try on some very expensive $ 2,000 cartier frames for himself 
 usually this does n't even catch my attention but the guy was just acting ... off 
 a few minutes pass and surprise surprise the guy decides he wants to buy them 
 great 
 my coworker processes the sale hands him the payment terminal so he can insert his card chip first into the machine to use his credit card canada 
 i notice the guy is pressing a few too many buttons way more than a 4 digit pin should be 
 just to be safe i casually pretend to put something away behind him and look at the machine 
 this fucker is on the swipe or type in your credit card number '' screen and typing in someone else 's credit card number 
 he feigned putting in his card so that he could enter in a stolen credit card number to put the sale under 
 i came up from behind and grabbed the machine from his hands 
 i told him he needs to use a real card or get out now 
 he acts all confused <unk> are you talking about 
 i asked to see the card in his hand to match the number with the card number he was trying to put into the machine 
 he suddenly lost all ability to speak and just kept asking what my problem was 
 i told him i knew what he was doing and he needs to pay with a real card or get out 
 he would not give up 
 he tried getting in my face i 'm a short young ish girl so i 'm not very intimidating so i offered to call the cops and have them handle it instead 
 i have never seen somebody high tail it out of there so fast in my life 
 so yeah if any of you work in high end stores keep a look out for this trick 
 apparantly another one of our stores had this happen to them but they did n't catch it until after they got a call a few days later telling them the card was stolen from a different <unk> 
 oh and how does my workplace <unk> me 
 our store is getting paid a few days late '' due to an accounting problem from another store '' 
 -_- why do i even bother 
 edit : wow this blew up over night 
 so happy this is my first big post : <unk> when i was a trainer at a canadian grocery chain i had this horrifying experience 
 beware : if you have a <unk> mom this might give you flashbacks 
 we usually <unk> ability '' levels together to make my job easier 
 that weekend had been a group of five high school girls 
 they were told to meet me at customer service and we would head to the boardroom 
 four of my girls had arrived and i patiently waited for the <unk> a girl named tina 
 two minutes before the training time started i saw her 
 but she was n't alone 
 she was with her mom 
 well that 's okay 
 maybe it 's her first job 
 my dad had snapped a photo of me at my first day at my first job so i just ignored it 
 i introduced myself to the girls and went over how they were gon na split the next 16 hours : one day training one 4 hour practice shift then one 4 hour real shift 
 i told them i 'd be there the entire time and blah blah blah basically gave my i 'm your number one right now '' spiel 
 i motioned for them to follow me to our boardroom 
 the mom got up too 
 she followed us all the way to the back doors 
 when i saw she had n't left i looked at tina who did not even make eye contact 
 so i guess i had to be the one to speak 
 excuse me ms. tina 's mom 
 we 're heading into our training now 
 if we finish early tina can use our phones to call but we should be done at 6 '' 
 tina 's mom : oh that 's okay 
 i 'll just come on back with y'all '' 
 what 
 um ... no 
 me : unfortunately i can not do that as the training session contains fairly confidential information 
 but we will be done at six and there 's plenty to do in this plaza if you do n't wan na go home yet '' 
 the mom looked slightly miffed but she <unk> and turned away 
 i glanced at tina again -- still no eye contact -- and then pushed open the doors 
 after six when i was in the office signing training forms my coworker popped in 
 cw : hey you know that lady who came in with your trainee 
 the blonde one '' 
 me : yeah 
 she wanted to come into our training session '' 
 cw : yeah she complained to sam our manager that you would n't let her 
 and then she sat on the bench until six '' 
 me : me : she sat there for eight hours '' 
 cw : she had an ipad but yeah 
 just sat there until your trainees were free '' 
 <unk> 
 i tried to <unk> it 
 maybe she was worried tina would get sick or something and she needed to be there 
 hopefully she would n't be back tomorrow 
 ... except she was 
 as i stood at a till with my trainees demonstrating the ins and outs of the register she stood at the bagging area and stared 
 i decided to ignore her and began my usual <unk> of on-the-go teaching i pretend to be a customer and they have to hit all the points before i put the next girl on 
 tina was my first because she drew the short straw 
 holy crap 
 for every mistake tina made her mom was criticizing her before i corrected it 
 i do n't know if her mom stole the manual or something but it was driving me nuts 
 and with each mistake that she got yelled at for she got more flustered and more prone to mistakes 
 after a particularly derogatory comment about tina 's <unk> <unk> i almost lost it 
 me : excuse me 
 i am the trainer here 
 i know tina is your daughter but she is currently my employee 
 i need to ask you to leave as you 're interfering with all my trainees '' 
 tina 's mom : that 's ridiculous 
 i should be allowed to be involved '' 
 me : well we hired tina 
 not you 
 so for as long as she 's on the clock your <unk> is not welcome '' 
 the mom stared at me -- beady eyes -- and then left to the bench she had sat on yesterday 
 she stared at me the entire time but whatever better than being a <unk> pain in my ass 
 tina <unk> greatly without her mother 's constant judgement 
 i was excited to see how my girls would <unk> the next day a sunday 
 sundays were good training days because you either sink or swim but my training was so good that all of my employees <unk> 
 tina seemed pretty shy so hopefully this would be a good experience for her 
 except and you probably guessed it tina did not show up on sunday 
 i called her house a few times throughout the week but she had no answer 
 after her training paycheck went through hr closed her employee file 
 and i felt pretty bad for her 
 how was she gon na do anything with a mom like that 
 like many of you brave <unk> i once worked retail 
 at one of the largest video game stores in the united states in fact 
 it was a glorious time just before the <unk> of corporate 's <unk> on reservations and <unk> but during the heady days of the newly launched xbox 360 and ps3 
 systems flew of the shelves jack thompson was the source of many a knowing chuckle and i truly enjoyed going into work each and every day 
 now because jack thompson was still a thing at that time we had all been briefed over and over again that we could not sell rated m games to <unk> and had to in every single case get the purchaser 's id 
 if the minor wanted the game we had to get their parent to approve 
 no parent no sale 
 cue the 13 year old <unk> kid 
 he <unk> into the store all dressed up trying to look as intimidating as a short chubby pre-teen with ego issues could 
 i kept an eye on him asked him if he needed help and went about my business 
 after about ten minutes he came up to the front desk with gta san <unk> 
 he slammed it down on the front desk and announced i 'm getting this '' 
 cheerful delighted me replied of course 
 can i see your id '' 
 blank stare 
 what '' 
 i helpfully flipped the game case over to the esrb rating 
 i 'm sorry but since this is a rated m for mature game i 'm not able to sell it without your id or your mother or father 's permission '' 
 his eyes lit up 
 little did i know i 'd given him the perfect out 
 with a hurried one sec '' he ran out of the store to fetch the parental unit 
 the parental unit in this case turned out to be his mother or possibly grandmother who clearly spoke little to no english as her frustrated chatter to her son revealed as she entered the store 
 * '' what do you need 
 * she grumbled at him as they came to the desk 
 * '' the lady needs your id just show her your license and say ok '' * her son told her as quickly as he could 
 * '' it 's nothing they 're just stupid 
 * now you might have noticed i put that dialogue in <unk> 
 that 's because it was conducted entirely in spanish and because thanks to my public school education i knew spanish 
 not well enough to write an essay but definitely well enough to follow the conversation and know the son was trying to pull a fast one on mom 
 time for due diligence 
 * '' ma'am i 'm sorry to bother you but your son wishes to purchase this mature game '' * i told her 
 her eyes widened 
 ed 
 note : i am the whitest white chick that ever walked the earth 
 i 'm so white my ancestors came over on the <unk> 
 * '' ok fine '' * she replied * '' let me get it 
 * she started to <unk> about in her purse while her son glared daggers at me 
 * '' there 's a little more to it '' * i told her 
 i pointed deliberately to the m rating 
 * '' this game has blood violence people having sex naked people drugs and other assorted mature <unk> 
 i want to make sure you understand this before i sell him the game 
 * her eyes got wider and wider with each strike against the game as her son wilted more and more 
 when i finished she whipped around grabbed her son by the ear and marched him out of the store <unk> <unk> and curses at him for trying to trick her into letting him get the game 
 i chuckled put the game away and lay in wait for the next troublemaker to enter the store.i work 3rd shift at a particularly large employer of many many people 
 one <unk> night as i was attending my putting things on shelves '' duties some teenaged kids came in and apparently started hiding some high dollar merchandise in the sporting good area 
 no one noticed this 
 later around 6 am the wind down of my night these kids came back with shopping carts running to where they hid all these items that they apparently absolutely could not live without 
 they grabbed all the stuff up and started booking for the door 
 the manager on duty however was having no theft on his watch mind you this mountain of a man 's <unk> is the punisher 
 he immediately chases after them and yells to the cashier on duty to call the fuckin cops 
 as he gets to the parking lot they 're speeding off in their <unk> sedona but do you think that stopped the punisher 
 no 
 as they 're speeding off to retire in style after their successful <unk> my salaried manager proceeds to throw a damn shopping cart at their car <unk> out their window 
 when he got on the phone with the cops he merely said yeah they 're in the white sedona with no rear window '' 
 tl dr manager throws shopping cart at thieves no <unk> on his part.background : i 'm a teenager working at a small clothing store in canada about 45 minutes away from the american border so we occasionally get a few customers from the states 
 normally i work cash so of course i get to deal with any of the confused customers over their purchases 
 the most common problem that <unk> is that people shopping here who come from the states are sometimes unaware or forget that canada does n't use pennies anymore they 're just gone from our <unk> system 
 instead we round to the nearest 5 or 10 so <unk> and <unk> round down to zero while 3¢ and <unk> round up to <unk> 
 pretty <unk> 
 our register will ring up the exact total and it is up to the cashier to figure out the rounding system to give out the change 
 i usually explain this to anyone confused as to why they did n't receive a penny and for the most part i 'm met with calm understanding 
 calm and understanding did not fit the personality of penny lady however 
 at the time i was ringing her up pl 's credit card had just gotten bounced so she grumbled a little bit and pulled out some cash to pay for her purchase 
 keep in mind my store sells pretty pricey clothing $ 40 minimum for a shirt ... so her purchase was about $ <unk> for 3 items 
 she pays the full amount in cash 1 $ 100 bill 1 $ 20 bill and 1 <unk> and i print out her receipt and wish her a good day like the obedient drone i am 
 this is where it gets ugly 
 the lady comes back ten minutes later when it 's thankfully quiet and marches up to me at the cash 
 & gt pl : ahem 
 & gt me : hi there *happy retail smile* is there something i can help you with 
 & gt pl : i did not recieve the proper amount of change 
 & gt me : oh my apologies miss may i see your receipt to confirm 
 & gt pl : *hands me the receipt* i expected better of this store i shop here all the time and i have never been <unk> like this before 
 & gt me : i 'm very sorry miss i 'll try and fix this as fast as possible how much change were you due 
 & gt pl : i was supposed to receive some change but i got none look at the receipt 
 glancing down at the receipt i check to see how much change she was due from her purchase 
 it says change due : $ <unk> '' which means i have to round down to no change 
 this lady essentially paid the full price in cash and was demanding a penny in change which i ca n't do 
 & gt me : ah i see the error here i 'm very sorry miss 
 <unk> the change due area on the receipt* you see we do n't use pennies anymore here i explain the penny system to her 
 & gt pl : well i 'm going back to the states tonight and i want some exact change back so the border security does n't pull me over 
 & gt me : miss i do n't travel much but i do n't think you 'll get called at the border over a penny they are aware of the rule i 'm afraid there 's nothing i can do for you 
 & gt pl : i do n't need your sass child 
 get me your manager 
 i 'm still smiling the happy retail smile as i go off to get my manager thinking oh you bitch it 's just a penny '' 
 luckily my cool manager cm has my back and he walks over and explains the same thing to the very flustered lady 
 she is still demanding her penny so he finally cracks 
 he walked into the back of the store found a penny lying on the ground covered in dust it 's been there <unk> but no one wants it for obvious reasons and walked back out 
 & gt cm : *handing the lady the <unk> here you are now please understand that we will not be giving out any more pennies thank you 
 the lady <unk> and finally leaves the store then cm <unk> me for handling the situation well 
 to this day i get slightly irritated whenever i have to explain the rule <unk> : i meant know the store 
 it 's 3 am ok so this just happened a few days ago nothing big just a slightly annoying occurrence as a customer 
 another thing worth knowing is that this specific store has a dress code of a dark blue shirt with their logo and black pants i was wearing a colorful and loud summer dress 
 so i was browsing an arts and crafts store chain art book addict 
 i like looking at the things i ca n't draw when i saw a female worker <unk> to be lost 
 i honestly thought she was new since anyone who is n't at the store regularly can get extremely lost so i asked if she was looking for something 
 & gt worker : do you have any idea where the faux plants are for <unk> projects 
 & gt me : the <unk> things 
 yeah over in <unk> next to the paints there 's a giant orange sign above it kind of hidden by the starter kits 
 & gt worker handing me a giant box of the <unk> : great go put this over there 
 after several painfully long seconds of me standing there awkwardly she gives me the dirtiest glare ever : well 
 go put it away 
 & gt me : i do n't work here 
 <unk> at her badge she was a manager 
 wtf 
 * & gt worker : oh ... ... well go do it anyway 
 & gt *is this real life 
 * me : ... ... ... what 
 & gt worker looking at me as if i was a fucking idiot : go put it away 
 & gt me : ... i just dropped the box and left fuck that lady 
 second edit : she does n't work there anymore she works at another store now 
 i have complained about her in that one but they still keep her 
 here 's another story from the gas station 
 this happened at the end of last winter 
 a customer calls us on our phone which is pretty unusual 
 normally the only calls we get are from other gas stations within our chain 
 without warning she says & gt customer : have you received any complaints about your gas being watered down '' 
 & gt me : no we have n't '' 
 & gt customer : well let me be the first '' 
 oh boy here we go 
 she explains that she filled her car and lawnmower with our gas after which the lawnmower would n't start she <unk> her car works fine however 
 she says she took her lawnmower into a repair place and they said the gas was watered down 
 great 
 i 'm thinking yeah probably because you let your lawnmower sit all winter and water accumulated over time 
 the more likely scenario is n't a conspiracy where we water our gas down and your lawnmower is the only machine in town sensitive enough to detect it '' 
 whatever 
 i give her my manager 's name take her phone number and tell her my manager will call her when she comes into work tomorrow 
 after hanging up the phone i joke with a customer who partially overheard the conversation 
 & gt woman : always a complaint call huh '' 
 & gt me : actually no 
 i mean we 're a gas station 
 who calls a gas station to complain '' 
 & gt woman : haha some people are crazy '' 
 i thought that was the end of it for me but it was n't 
 a couple days later i ask my manager if she ever called lawnmower lady 
 she says she did but lawnmower lady did n't answer 
 later i 'm told by a coworker that lawnmower lady came to the store on his shift the previous night 
 she wanted to speak with the manager my coworker informed her my manager only works mornings 
 the next day lawnmower lady shows up on my shift asking the same thing as well as telling me about her lawnmower again 
 i text my manager you need to talk to this woman 
 she 's gon na keep bothering us until she speaks with you '' 
 my manager tells me to email lawnmower lady 's info to the store director and have the store director deal with her 
 a few days later she comes in on my shift <unk> 
 we 've told her multiple times my manager only works mornings so i do n't know why she thought she 'd be here this time 
 <unk> no one has called her 
 i finally tell her & gt '' look we do n't water down our gas 
 we conform to all fuel regulations '' 
 i kinda pulled fuel regulations '' out of my ass 
 i 'm sure that 's probably a thing but i do n't really know 
 i 'm just a clerk tired of being the <unk> between her and the higher-ups who do n't want to deal with her 
 & gt '' is it possible that water accumulated in your lawnmower 's gas tank from sitting unmaintained all winter '' 
 that 's a thing too right 
 & gt customer : oh no that 's not possible 
 the repair shop said the gas was watered down '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry 
 i 'll email the store director again and have him call you '' 
 apparently the store director passed her over to our corporate office and had them call her 
 mercifully that was finally the end of it 
 i kinda wish i knew what they told her to get her to stop 
 **tl dr : ** woman on a <unk> <unk> our gas station higher-ups force me to deal with her because they do n't want to she finally stops after getting the phone call she <unk> at a movie theatre concession stand i once had a customer demand my manager before anything had happened 
 while the manager leaned over my shoulder she began ranting about how rude it was that the girl who sold her tickets did n't even stand up to greet her 
 before the manager had a chance to react i replied she 's in a fucking wheelchair ... 
 ma'am '' 
 edit : apparently i need to clarify so people 's underwear remain in an <unk> state : i said this because i was shocked not because i 'm trying to sound like some sort of badass 
 just because she 's a <unk> does n't mean she needs to be so fucking rude '' 
 long time lurker here first time posting finally had something happen that i thought was worthy 
 so i work for a large international coffee chain that is very lenient in customer service in terms of giving whatever the customer wants to a degree of course 
 so i just started my lunch break on an extremely slow day when a lady comes in 
 i 'm about to order a drink for my break when i hear the following interaction with my coworker & gt lady : this is the worst cup of coffee i have ever tasted 
 & gt coworker : oh i 'm so sorry about that let me get you a new one 
 proceeds to dispense coffee from same container & gt lady : this tastes much better but is still crap 
 she then somehow manages to spill a little on her shirt & gt lady : i spilled this coffee on my shirt 
 this is your fault the cups and sleeves you guys use are awful competitor x has much better cups 
 at this point my coworker is a little flustered and as the supervisor i decide to jump in & gt me : hi ma'am i 'm so sorry to hear that our coffee is n't to your standard i see that we are almost done brewing a fresh batch let me get you a new one and double cup it for you 
 & gt lady : i do n't care your cups are still crap unlike competitor x & gt me : actually ma'am we use the same company as competitor x for our cups and sleeves and there 's nothing i can do about that but feel free to send an email to corporate they actually do listen 
 here is your new cup of coffee straight from the brewer black as you requested i hope you are satisfied with this one 
 she begrudgingly takes the cup of coffee walks over to the <unk> stand pours out half of it into the garbage puts a ton of sugar and fills half the cup with milk 
 she comes back to the cash register and i realize that i will never get to go on my break 
 & gt lady : this coffee is n't even hot can you microwave it 
 & gt me : ma'am that coffee was straight from the brewer to your cup i can not make it any hotter than that 
 we do not have a microwave and i do not recommend <unk> your coffee as it will <unk> the taste and these cups are <unk> & gt lady : but i put cold milk in it it makes it room temperature & gt me : ma'am i can not do anything about cold milk making your coffee <unk> if you 'd like you can get <unk> milk with your coffee for 60 cents extra but i can not do anything else otherwise normally i would just give them the upgrade for free but screw this woman 
 & gt lady <unk> at me like i 've said the most ridiculous thing in the world* : you expect me to pay 60 cents for that 
 this is ridiculous 
 i go to competitor x all the time and do n't have this problem 
 & gt me : ma'am i do n't want you to walk away unhappy with a cup of coffee you are not satisfied with but there is really nothing i can do here is your money back if you feel that competitor x can meet your standards then i honestly encourage you to go there since this is something i can not fix i would not feel comfortable serving people <unk> milk with their coffee 
 & gt lady : fine 
 i 'll take my money back 
 can i get a cup of hot water 
 i take the coffee back which <unk> her clearly she wanted attention and a free coffee give her the hot water she proceeds to sit at the only handicap accessible table we have leaves an hour later with her cup of hot water untouched 
 bonus note : she apparently has gone to another nearby location before and complained that her cup caught fire when she tried to microwave it at home 
 p.s 
 someone told her it was not <unk> and it is also clearly marked 
 edited for <unk> : i work in a supermarket 
 i 've been there nearly seven years and i 've run out of any fucks i previously had when i began 
 today was slightly different 
 prepare for a long wild ride 
 i 'm hanging out packing bags for a coworker anything to get out of doing real work when the customer points at the screen and abruptly says : that 's wrong '' 
 & gt me : oh sorry what 's wrong '' 
 & gt her : the salad tubs 
 they should be 2 for $ 7 '' 
 i go and check out the deli sign realise she 's got one <unk> tub $ 4 and one <unk> $ 5 
 the special is only for the classic tubs the sign very clearly states that under the classic heading 
 there is no mention of any special under the gourmet heading 
 i grab the sign and head back over to the register 
 & gt me : sorry look you 've grabbed one of each it 's only the classic tubs that are on sale would you like me to get you another classic tub '' 
 & gt her : that 's wrong 
 that 's false advertising 
 if it 's written on the sign it means all of them '' 
 & gt me : ah well sorry that is n't how it works ... '' & gt her : you have to give it to me for $ 7 
 your attitude is <unk> '' 
 & gt coworker : i ca n't mark stuff down without asking the night manager '' 
 & gt her : call him down here now '' 
 so i call him he 's busy he asks what the go is i explain <unk> : & gt '' give it to her for $ 7 '' 
 what 
 no 
 get fucked 
 no 
 i ca n't yet totally can believe this is happening to me 
 i take a deep breath turn around and smile 
 & gt me : i 've spoken to him and he says today we will reduce the price for you '' 
 & gt her : it is n't <unk> the price 
 it is giving me what i am entitled to '' 
 coworker changes the prices she slams her card into the machine transaction does n't process because she 's put in the wrong pin 
 & gt coworker : sorry you 've put the wrong pin in can you please try again '' 
 & gt her : stop <unk> my finances 
 what 's your name 
 mark 
 * mark you will be hearing from me '' 
 holy fucking <unk> on a bike 
 she finally leaves i 'm shaking because i really do not deal well with people shouting at me but the next customer is lovely and we all relax and it 's going to be alright 
 <unk> 
 half an hour later the night manager calls from upstairs 
 & gt him : yolanda 
 what did you and mark do 
 i 've never had a customer yell so loudly about how bad the staff are '' 
 & gt me : *explains <unk> & gt him : no 
 you know better 
 customer is always right 
 if they 're going to be like that give them what they want and move on 
 their happiness & gt yours '' 
 i hang up the phone look at mark and burst into tears 
 i have n't cried for years at this job 
 i am so ashamed 
 people are looking at me so i just mumble back in a minute '' walk outside and just let rip for about five minutes 
 i eventually feel bad for leaving mark on register alone fix my makeup and go back inside 
 the rest of the shift passes a man steals $ 100 of meat kids are caught stuffing chocolate down their pants mark makes me laugh 
 just before i leave the night manager pulls me aside and repeats exactly what he said earlier 
 i smile nod leave call my boyfriend rant forever come home and now i 'm writing this 
 i really wish the end to this massive post was and that 's the story of why i quit my job '' but today is not that day 
 instead i 'm just gon na eat some pizza pockets play mario <unk> and fantasize about the day i do quit 
 *name changed to protect my favorite work pal 
 edit : formatting edit 2 : more formatting oh god sorry i am the worsthello tfr 
 been wanting to post a story here for a while but i could n't decide on one 
 this one comes to you from 13 years ago 
 our tale starts in a big blue box department store in a small town 
 i was fresh out of high school and working there back when they actually gave full time jobs 
 i was a jack of all <unk> pretty much 
 cashier stock service desk cart pusher 
 on this day i was outside pushing carts 
 it seemed like any other day and pretty soon it was lunch time 
 i head back to the break room and grab my lunch 
 i would later wish i 'd headed out to eat that day 
 luckily i had time to finish eating and by now am just relaxing and chatting with coworkers 
 the phone in the break room rings and someone answers it 
 they <unk> at me and tell me i have a call 
 the person on the other end is a girl from the service desk telling me an officer wanted to speak with me 
 what 
 really 
 i crack up laughing 
 i 've never had a problem with the law ... is this a prank 
 next thing i know i hear this loud male voice in my ear 
 sir this is officer i 'm a prick and i know it and i need you up front now '' 
 well <unk> 
 wtf is going on 
 so i <unk> the long way through the huge store back up front and find the officer 
 he proceeds to ask me if i saw a purse while i was outside cart pushing 
 nope sure did n't officer 
 he of course does n't believe me 
 well a lady lost her purse and says she saw you outside pushing carts at the <unk> 
 that 's great officer 
 she probably saw me as i was heading back in for lunch so i would n't have wound up pushing her cart 
 did you drive to work '' 
 he asks me 
 yup 
 sure did 
 so he has me show him to my car 
 asks if he can look inside 
 i 've got nothing to hide so i let him 
 he opens all the car doors pops the hood and the trunk looking for this ladies purse 
 during the process of searching my car he found a check my grandma wrote to my girlfriend for her birthday and took it 
 he also found an old id that a friend had left in my car that i never knew was there and gave me hell for having some else 's id 
 <unk> me heavily about the check 
 told him it was a check from my grandmother to my girlfriend and she rode into work with me so she left it in the car 
 oh she 's here too '' 
 so ... we go walking back into the store where he has me point her out so he can give her the check back 
 she glares at him and hands it right back to me 
 he then grabs it from my hand and gives it back to her and tells her not to give it to me again 
 she gives him the evil eye and says he 's the one with the bank account he 's going to be cashing it for me and as soon as you leave he is going to be the one holding it again 
 with that she walked away 
 the cop looked pretty mad 
 he starts <unk> me if i have a locker in the back 
 nope i do n't 
 they only give lockers to girls 
 then he tries to <unk> a confession out of me 
 not happening bud i did n't do shit 
 finally he leaves 
 at this point it 's been over 2 hours he 'd kept me from working and i was still off the clock from lunch 
 i went and raised hell with the managers but all they did was tell me i 'd be paid for the lost time and that was about it 
 so there we have it 
 the story of how i had to be guilty because in very busy shopping center i was the only minimum wage peon in the area so it had to be my fault 
 edit : thanks to everyone who 's reminded me what my rights are when dealing with a cop 
 rest assured i am well aware of them 
 however as i mentioned at the beginning of this story this was 13 years ago i was a punk teenager who had never been in trouble with the law and honestly i had no clue and was completely freaked out that it was even being <unk> i was guilty of a crime.alright a bit of an over exaggeration but it was amazing 
 i used to work at a movie rental store no not that one and had an awesome crew but my boss was the best 
 he was a hard worker would do anything and everything to help the store 
 he was behind the counter out in the floor cleaning ect 
 now this story is a time he was behind the counter helping check in movies as i helped checking people out 
 a couple came though the line and circled around to pick up the movies 
 we are supposed to tell people about movies that are coming out the next week but i always forgot so my boss would pick up my slack 
 as the man in the couple picked up the <unk> my boss loudly told him that p.s 
 i love you was coming out next week 
 but in the noise of the store it sounded like he only said i love you 
 the man had the most frightened look on his face and quickly looked at me and at his wife/girlfriend before stammering out i ... love you too '' 
 before practically running out the door 
 i was lost in a fit of giggles as my boss turned to me and asked why the hell the customer said he loved him 
 it took a little bit but i finally got him to understand 
 he stopped <unk> that movie to customers after 
 tldr : boss announces love customer returns it <unk> your usual tfr story but a story nonetheless 
 like most of us i do actually enjoy my job 
 i get on great with my coworkers i 'm good at what i do and generally enjoy going to work 
 aside from one little thing 
 my dm is a wretched person 
 i 'll be told to follow a <unk> from her follow it to the letter then be yelled at for doing it 
 she lies covers up major <unk> in her favorite stores treats everyone else like garbage 
 she 'll refuse our schedules if they have any <unk> of break coverage 
 i even got an email from her talking trash about our store to another in the district that she sent us on accident and does n't know we have 
 like really she is terrible 
 i now dread speaking with her because she has a knack for making me feel about 2 inches tall regardless of what i do or how hard i work 
 saturday was the last straw 
 it was the final day of our <unk> year 
 we had a sales goal for the year that if we made we would get a ft assistant management position opening in our store as we would have made enough to pay those hours and benefits 
 and our store had it all set up 
 we only have 9 employees in our store and knew we would promote our pt assistant manager ft and i would would fill the pt slot 
 so we <unk> 
 we made and then exceeded our goal 
 pumped 
 we were so pumped 
 we worked so hard this year to make it and it paid off 
 so our pt emailed our dm to inform her we made it and she would like to apply and our dm replies that she appreciated the offer but we needed an additional 50k to open that position 
 after telling us all year otherwise 
 i have never been so crushed at work 
 ever 
 i spent the past year not complaining about her for fear of being denied this promotion and now it 's gone 
 now i have nothing to lose 
 i 've made the call am waiting to hear back from our head of hr to discuss everything 
 i 've started applying for other jobs just in case i get fired over this 
 today i take a stand and quite possibly lose the best job i 've ever had because i ca n't do it anymore 
 edit : called back dude is on the other line 
 calling again in 20. edit 2 : just got off the phone with him 
 he seemed very shocked and taken aback by everything i heard 
 told me he was going to speak to my rm who is conveniently out there for meetings so he 'll have face time with her 
 he 's going to speak to my store manager and be sure to address her concerns as well to solve this without retaliation being a thing 
 i work at one of the largest department store companies in the country 
 unfortunately one of our higher end competitors give customers everything they want so it sets them up for the conversation i had with a customer on the phone the other day 
 i was working the fragrance counter when a customer calls 
 me : thank you for calling red star department store <unk> how may i help you 
 customer : hi i was in your store the other day and purchased a $ 120 bottle of perfume but today it broke 
 is there any way i can exchange it for a new one 
 me : definitely 
 did it stop spraying or the cap bust or something 
 customer : no i knocked it off of my counter and it busted all over my floor 
 i have the glass in a bag i can bring it in 
 me : so you dropped a glass bottle on the floor and it shattered and you think that 's our responsibility 
 i 'm sorry but we 're not liable for that 
 there 's nothing we can do to replace the bottle 
 customer : thats ridiculous higher end retailer would never blame me for this 
 me : then you should probably buy your next fragrance from there 
 *hangs <unk> friend and his family have owned a typical little convenience store in a rough neighborhood for more than fifteen years 
 he and his family are legal <unk> from <unk> and *nothing* <unk> him 
 he 's had people try and rob him on occasion but if he 's behind the counter it 's guaranteed they will be unsuccessful 
 these are two of my favorite stories i wish you could hear them in his voice 
 i will refer to him as j and customers as tm <unk> one evening four <unk> guys came in and went straight to the counter to look at the large bottles of liquor on the shelves behind my friend 
 j : good evening 
 may i help you 
 tm : yeah ... how much is that bottle 
 tm then pulls out a huge belt knife and uses it to point to the largest bottle on the top shelf 
 his friends are trying to <unk> their laughter 
 j who then pulls out his <unk> s & amp w out of his waistband and points it to the same bottle : you mean this one here 
 he said the instant silence was priceless 
 tm mumbled something and they quickly left 
 another time close to closing another tm came in and quickly pulled out a handgun went to the counter and said quick old man give all your money in the drawer '' 
 j stays calm with the gun pointed at his head and says okay ... okay ... let me get it for you '' 
 j opens the till calmly takes out all the bills stacks them into one pile and sets it on the counter directly between them 
 when tm shifts his eyes to look at the stack of money j snatched the gun right out of tm 's hand and begins to examine it 
 j : you did n't really plan this very well did you 
 you know you could have <unk> this for a lot more than what 's in that pile right there 
 vaguely points the gun at tm i think you should just leave right now before something bad happens yes 
 i loved hearing him tell me his stories 
 edit 1 : those of you who 've asked for more stories of j '' i will 
 some asshole broke my pc and i 've only had my phone to do this so it might take me a few of days 
 i will tell j '' of his fans at reddit 
 edit 2 : apparently this post was <unk> deleted because it was two stories in one post 
 right after i split them into two seperate posts a mod found it and put it back up 
 so if you see the other two please do n't be cross that they are the same stories ... i 'm just too tired to take them down 
 i will be posting a couple more soon ... edit 3 : okay i deleted the two separate stories because i just know that they would give everyone false hope of a new story and then they 'd be angry with <unk> i had a customer come up to me this morning asking if a product worked for whatever he needed and i responded with absolutely it does '' 
 customer : why do you say absolutely 
 me : what do you mean 
 what do you prefer me to say 
 customer : just do n't say absolutely i do n't like people saying that to me 
 me : umm okay ... customer : do you have product '' anywhere 
 without thinking i respond with absolutely if you follow that wall *points to <unk> it 's to the left 
 at this point he got very annoyed and just walked away 
 no idea why he did n't like the word but i usually use it since it sounds polite in my language 
 i work at a grocery store and yesterday i had the pleasure of babysitting the customers who decided to try their luck at self-checkout 
 about half way through my shift we were pretty slow 
 we had about 11 registers open not including the four self-checkout registers and not many customers 
 this woman walks up to one of the self-checkout registers and begins to scan her items 
 a couple items in she looks at me and gives me the come here '' motion with her finger 
 as i am walking towards her i begin the question yes ma'am '' 
 only to be interrupted by a coupon being shoved into my face and the rude lady rl for the rest of the story saying put this in for me '' 
 the conversation goes as follows : & gt me : you want me to put the coupon in for you 
 & gt rl : i do n't know how to do this 
 i am not a checker 
 she says this while waving the coupon about two inches from my face with each word 
 she then shoves the coupon into my hand when she is done 
 & gt me : when you 're done scanning your items hit the pay now '' button and it will tell you how to scan your coupons 
 i say this as i toss the coupon back onto her register so she continues scanning her items throwing things that she no longer wants into the candy bin behind her 
 as i am retrieving some of these misplaced items she stops coworker cw who is walking by to help her ring up some avocados 
 & gt rl : help we with these avocados i do n't know how to work this 
 & gt cw : oh this is how you do it ... he proceeds to type in the code for her and explains how she could do it herself for future reference 
 & gt rl : god i better get put onto the payroll when i 'm finished here 
 lady you 're the one who decided to go through <unk> time for another story from the grocery store deli 
 while the store itself is open 24 hours the deli and meat departments which are right next to each other close at 9pm 
 the meat department closes right at 9 and they are usually gone soon after 
 in the deli we have a little more cleaning to do after we 're technically closed so we 'll be around until close to <unk> 
 so the other day i get this lady that approaches me as i 'm finishing up our closing tasks 
 she asks where something in the meat department is 
 since we 're right next to each i know my way around the department pretty well and know where stuff is 
 she was asking about something that was on sale that week 
 i took her to where it was and showed her 
 she says no that 's not what i 'm looking for '' 
 english obviously was n't her first language so i thought maybe i misunderstood so i asked her to repeat it 
 yep we 're standing directly in front of it 
 she then pulls out the weekly ad and points at what she wants 
 i point at the product right in front of us 
 her no this '' 
 pointing again i then pick up the product and put it next to the ad to show her this is what 's in the ad 
 she says no again 
 then she gives up and walks away mumbling something about how i need to learn to do my job 
 ugh not even my department 
 so i work at a zoo located in the general location of not america 
 my job mostly involves helping customers sign up for 1-year membership passes 
 occasionally we have those trying to sign up for a membership after purchasing tickets 
 it 's not usually a problem seeing as we can refund the cost and let the customer only pay the difference 
 this german man walked in with his family looking to sign up for a membership 
 i 'm assuming german because of his heavy accent 
 on reaching my co-worker 's counter he mentioned that he had already bought tickets and asked if we could refund the cost 
 cue the conversation 
 co worker : m german guy : g m : not a problem sir i can refund you the ticket cost 
 all i need is your receipt 
 we need the receipt to ensure he bought the tickets g : why do you need my receipt 
 m : ... insert aforementioned spiel g : why 
 are you accusing me of fraud 
 m : no ... we just- g : this is ridiculous 
 i do n't need to give my receipt 
 just do your job quickly 
 we eventually found out the bastard just lost his <unk> i was much younger i used to work as a server at a popular rotisserie chicken restaurant 
 it was n't a fancy joint being more of a fast-food dine in chain that made food that was n't horrible but nothing special 
 i typically handled small booths and tables of 5-6 people each but on this night i had my usual section plus an additional party of about 15 people to <unk> all at once 
 the worst is when everyone in a large party orders some kind of <unk> drink one person wanting a <unk> prepared a certain way or a double shot of this or that 
 this party ordered a ton of drinks one of which was a bloody caesar ordered by an older gentleman 
 after delivering the order to the bar i went about taking care of my regular tables and delivering the drinks and meals as they became available 
 after about 10 minutes the caesar was n't yet ready and i kept getting looks from the old man as i brought everyone else their drinks 
 another 5 minutes go by and the drink still was n't ready despite my <unk> at the bar and the old man points to his watch with a displeased look on his face 
 i apologized and made a beeline for the bar where i asked the bartender to just make the drink before the old man blew a <unk> and i stood there waiting 
 as i waited a young couple came up to the bar to pay for their dinner 
 they had a tiny little girl with them about 4 years old who came and stood right next to me as i waited 
 i paid little attention to them as i was <unk> about my tables and the orders as they <unk> piled up as i waited 
 when the drink finally arrived i do n't know if it was just stress excitement or a lack of attention and focus on my behalf but i grabbed that drink with the force of a thousand <unk> causing the liquid in the glass to fly up and out and down all over the little girl 's face standing next to me 
 bloody caesar all over this child 's innocent little smile and yellow jacket 
 in slow motion i looked down realized what happened looked up saw the parents glare at me with a look of death that would <unk> luigi 's and back down to the child 
 i <unk> something that sounded like an apology before running to the kitchen to grab some paper towel and back out again to give it to the parents who looked like they were going to <unk> me with the nearest <unk> 
 but before they could act on their murderous thoughts the little girl piped up and said 'good thing i was wearing my rain jacket huh daddy 
 in the most charming and nonchalant way imaginable 
 the parents both laughed their anger suddenly taken away by their daughter 's adorable observation and the father simply said 'oh suzy 
 they actually smiled at me as i apologized and i felt my sudden fear vanish 
 i got that old fucker his caesar and could n't have cared less about the way he stared at me or what he thought 
 it 's just a drink one of many drinks he 'll have in his life 
 the little girl and her ability to break through the <unk> reactions that adults have left me with a great memory and lesson which is to never get stressed out because even when bad things happen there 's always a positive perspective to be found 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 **story : ** most of the time my customers like to take their time shopping 
 they 'll browse up and down the aisles watch some videos growls some more then back to the videos 
 i actually prefer it when shoppers take their time 
 we get to show off all of our stuff and help them pick out something they 'll really enjoy 
 this story is not about those shoppers 
 one evening a guy literally runs into the tent and shoves $ 300 into my hands 
 **guy : ** “i need $ 300 of the best stuff you got fast.” **me : ** “okay” **guy : ** “i need to be back at my house in less than five minutes 
 they’re watching <unk> **me : ** oookayyyy 
 “do you want smaller stuff that <unk> longer or do you want larger stuff that 's more impressive ” **guy : ** “i want the boom ” i handed the money to the cashier and told her to ring the guy up for $ 300 grabbed one of my <unk> and hit the floor 
 i headed straight for our big stuff and started grabbing my favorite items off of the shelf handing them to the stocker who was running back and forth like a <unk> piling up fireworks on the counter 
 i kept a running tally in my head and quickly grabbed about $ 330 worth of stuff 
 **me : ** “that 's around $ 330 of fireworks 
 does that work for you ” **guy : ** “is that the boom ” **me : ** “that is definitely the boom ” we grabbed all of his stuff and <unk> out to his car quickly filling his back seat and trunk with fireworks 
 he jumped in the car and tore out of the parking lot like he was being chased by a demon 
 my stocker and i were laughing out loud and talking abotu the guy when we walked back into the tent 
 **me : ** “that was insane 
 that might be the quickest $ 300 sale i’ve ever made.” **cashier : ** <unk> you hear him when he said why he had to get home so fast ” **me : ** “no 
 what up ” **cashier : ** laughing “he was wearing an ankle monitor 
 he’s under house arrest and he said it checks every 10 minutes to make sure he’s at <unk> now that’s a guy that loves his fireworks 
 sadly i haven’t seen him back so i’m guessing his case didn’t go so well

 <unk> aka fred <unk> -- -- -- - if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here doing this on mobile so i apologize if the format is a bit <unk> 
 anyway for the past 8 months or so i 've worked at a local chain retail store 
 this is one of my favorite moments from working there 
 i was doing what i normally do stacking things on the pasta aisle and making sure everything 's in the right spot 
 you know the usual stuff 
 after doing this for an hour or so i hear a voice behind me 
 well why do n't we just ask this young man right here '' 
 i spin around and see an older gentleman sitting in one of those motorized scooters department stores have talking to his wife 
 they start making their way very slowly as you would imagine down my aisle but his wife passes me with a frown and says no i know where it 's at i do n't need anyone 's help '' the man then rides up next to me and tells me with huge tint of sarcasm oh nevermind ... i guess we know where it 's at after all '' 
 this gave us both a chuckle 
 immediately after he <unk> off to catch up to his wife who is a few feet from rounding the corner of the aisle 
 he gets between the aisle she is turning on and herself and waits for her to start turning 
 when she finally starts rounding the corner in front of his little scooter the man takes his walking cane out of his scooter basket and in one quick motion taps his wife on the butt and starts to whistle 
 shocked and red in the face his wife asks did you just <unk> my bottom '' 
 with a smile he states it 's hard not to with an ass like that babe '' and turns around and gives me a thumbs up and rides off 
 i hear her mumble gosh i love you '' and she continues on her way with a huge smile 
 at this point i 'm standing there with this goofy look on my face and i can only say one thing 
 i hope when i get that age my future wife and i are still full of love and life just like they were 
 so thank you mr. scooter man for making one employee 's day 
 edit : man you guys are awesome i 'm glad you all like it 
 i actually see them from time to time and mr. scooter man always comes to my department and we <unk> chat for a bit 
 he 's a really awesome guy 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven 
 **story : ** you can’t imagine the things people offer to trade for fireworks 
 in my business the barter system is alive and well and i 'm always willing to listen to a trade proposal 
 heck i’ve even made more than a few barter offers myself 
 here are a few of the things i’ve bartered for over the years 
 * my 6 x 12 <unk> <unk> utility trailer was paid for half in cash and half in fireworks 
 * this past year i had a gentleman trade me silver eagle coins for fireworks 
 * i’ve traded advertising and promotional spots for fireworks 
 * i’ve traded pizza and catering for fireworks 
 * i’ve traded on site electrical work for fireworks 
 * my chilled water dispenser was a trade for fireworks that i bartered off of craigslist 
 but my favorite trade by far happened three years ago this new year 's eve 
 a guy walked into my tent and asked to speak to the manager 
 the company he worked for was throwing a new year 's eve party and he wanted to know if i would be interested in doing a trade for fireworks 
 i told him maybe and asked what they wanted to trade 
 he led me outside to his suv and popped the back 
 i can only hope that one day when i eventually die and i arrive at the pearly gates to be greeted by st. <unk> that i experience the joy and amazement that i felt at that very moment 
 there beaming up at me from the back of that magical suv were more than 3 dozen bottles of <unk> <unk> 
 there were a dozen bottles each of makers mark and <unk> creek 
 the rest were assorted high end bottles of <unk> vodka and whiskey with two bottles of whiskey in a plain white label that were sent to distributors for tasting and we 're not on the market yet they were fantastic 
 it turns out that he worked for a local liquor distributor and i can guarantee you that they had an amazing fireworks show that new year 's eve 
 my employees were also very happy with their additional nye bonus 
 -- -- -- - if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here first post be nice 
 backstory : so i 'm 20 and work part time in a major uk supermarket 
 our store is unlike most supermarkets in that there is no nearby <unk> and is located in the city centre 
 i am the <unk> person that gets to supervise the <unk> checkouts 
 there is 9 in total for one person to supervise 
 one particularly busy period an obnoxious middle aged woman omaw interrupted me whilst i was helping another customer and demanded i show her how to use the machine 
 i asked her to please be patient until i had finished helping the current customer and that i would be right with her 
 when i got around to helping her she had already attempted to use the machine herself and had of course failed to follow any of the on screen instructions and had every possible error occurring at once 
 me : ok you 've actually put your items on the wrong side of the checkout which is why you 're getting these errors 
 do n't worry a lot of people make that mistake 
 i 'll just sort it for you 
 omaw : huffs sighs <unk> etc me : is this your first time using one of these machines then 
 omaw : yes i 'm in a big hurry i 've just parked my car outside because i needed a couple of things before i go home 
 i glance up to where she indicated and see her car parked literally outside the front door of the store right in the middle of a bus lane 
 me : right so all you have to do is ... i explain the procedure and even process a couple of items for her 
 ok 
 omaw : yes fine 
 i then go and help another machine that requires approval for alcohol before i get another tap on my shoulder omaw : the stupid machine is broken me : well let 's have a look 
 ok you 've actually put all your items into the bagging area but none have been scanned 
 omaw : yes i did what you told me to do me : well i 'm afraid none of your items have registered if you did try to scan them let 's put them through again 
 this time i process her entire basket just to try and get rid of her omaw : you ca n't tell me what to do 
 you 're probably not even out of your teens 
 you have no right to tell me i did it wrong no right at all 
 you 're just a stupid little boy 
 me : quite obviously shocked at the outburst i was simply telling you what you may have done wrong 
 omaw : why do they hire young people when they are so rude 
 where is your manager 
 i personally love it when this happens 
 so i go and get the manager causing more <unk> for herself and the 8 other machines i 'm supposed to be helping as well as a queue of people which has now formed man ager : hello there what seems to be the problem 
 omaw : yes this idiot you 've employed is being very rude man : well we take abuse in out store very seriously if i could just take some details off you 
 omaw gives name address and telephone number man : ok thank you for that 
 i 'd like to now tell you that you will be placed on the list of customers banned from the store 
 i will not tolerate abuse to my staff 
 good day 
 omaw : what 
 i work for the council you ca n't do that 
 man : i 'm <unk> i can now are you going to leave or shall i call security to escort you off the premises 
 omaw : i 'm going but i will close this store down just you wait until i get back to the office 
 man : ok then have a nice evening 
 omaw storms out of the store gets into her illegaly parked car and drives the wrong way down a one way road straight into the path of an oncoming police car who gives her a fixed penalty notice on the spot all right outside the front of the store 
 omaw looks around exasperated and then looks straight at me as i stand there staring right back with a huge grin on my face 
 tl dr : middle aged council worker was unnecessarily rude to me was banned from store and received a fine from the police 
 edit : wow 
 my first entry hit the front page of this sub 
 i 'd just like to point out that my first language is n't english so you 'll have to bear with me 
 i tried making it good 
 just found this sub and really wanted to share this story 
 so i used to work at a tool store and we had quite a lot of tools to choose from 
 relevant to the story : i do work on my own and friends cars in my free time and that experience usually came in handy when finding the appropriate tools for people 
 anyway one day a guy comes in through the doors and he has the look '' 
 now most people might not be familiar with the look but anyone having worked in retail or the general service industry knows it 
 it 's the look you get from people that are much much better than you and you should be grateful that they want to grace you with their presence 
 yep this guy was one of them 
 anyway the guy walks towards me and with a <unk> of arrogance not too strong yet <unk> his <unk> barks : do you have any insert specific tool brand '' wrenches '' 
 unfortunately i do n't sir but i do have insert different brand '' which is at least **as** good if not better '' & lt -- it was n't a lie 
 he said something demeaning - i ca n't quite remember what it was - but brushed it off and i guided him to the relevant section 
 while showing him our strongest wrenches i made a point of telling him where they were made how they were better than others etc as he had suggested that he wanted quality 
 he cut me off and with slightly more arrogance than initially and without even bothering looking at me said : yeah yeah that 's what you 're supposed to say '' combined with his tone and body language he heavily <unk> that i had no idea what i was talking about and did n't have the faintest idea on how to use tools 
 i really ca n't do this guy justice with my writing skills 
 he was a class act 
 a bit surprised by his attitude i replied with the <unk> in town buys these wrenches from us and they say that they 're <unk> strong and <unk> '' to which he replied again <unk> yeah right 
 <unk> you 'd say that 
 they 'd better be fucking strong for what i 'm going to use them for 
 i 've already snapped a <unk> insert preferred brand '' wrench '' snapping a wrench is not normal especially not one of the brand he was using so i asked what is it you 're trying to do if you do n't mind me asking '' 
 while heavily hinting that i had no understanding of what he was doing he replied with : i 'm replacing the balljoints on my car and the upper ones are so fucking stuck that the wrench snapped as i was <unk> one of them out '' and starting turning away as not to waste more time on me 
 i was as always friendly and polite throughout our entire interaction and with the exact same manner i said : well no wonder you ca n't get it out - you 're doing it wrong '' he stopped dead in his tracks turned his head to look at me and said : what '' 
 me : you 're saying that <unk> of the upper <unk> is stuck which tells me that it 's some kind of volkswagen 
 correct '' 
 with a dumbfounded look and while turning around to fully face me again he replied yes ... '' 
 i now had his full attention 
 ... and since it has multiple balljoints it 's going to be one of the larger <unk> 
 is it a <unk> '' 
 he looked at me in disbelief and replied : uhm yes it is '' me : yeah you 're not getting that balljoint off like that 
 i could sell you one off these wrenches and you 'd most likely snap it as well '' 
 and then i really started enjoying myself as i had to explain captain arrogance here how and why he had to do it differently 
 i continued : see a balljoint is <unk> and when they start to <unk> they get *really* stuck 
 you need to remove the bolt that goes through the <unk> and hit the knuckle with a hammer 
 <unk> start hitting the balljoint as you 'll be doing it for a week and nothing will happen 
 hit the knuckle '' 
 i have to admit 
 i felt pretty god damn awesome right then as i had proven to this arrogant fool that i was actually much more qualified than he was despite not having acted like an asshole 
 him while still trying to keep his composure : uhm ... well i guess i 'll go home and try that 
 i 'm still going to need the wrench though as mine is ruined '' the guy came back the following day and with a big ass smile on his face he said to me : i hit it twice then it was out '' 
 he treated me respectfully ever <unk> for the length i got a bit carried away 
 **tl dr woman tries to bring back abused cat gets arrested 
 ** <unk> i own a 15 acre <unk> of land that is part animal shelter and part pet store 
 all of the money made from the pet store goes back to restocking and helping out the shelter 
 the shelter has many different types of animals 
 we take the normal dogs cats and rabbits 
 but we also take birds <unk> reptiles snakes lizards ect 
 <unk> <unk> horses and even the occasional <unk> or <unk> 
 each animal species gets around an acre or two horses get three and they have that area to roam around and be free cats have an outdoor <unk> in area to sit outside without getting out 
 this system is the only way i started this place up 
 my sister is the only vet so it can get pretty hectic 
 the store is like a little pet boutique and we frequently get pet brands to donate items to our store 
 **story** christmas is over and the people from retail can relax right 
 my store offers a 30 day money back guarantee for all items sold in the store 
 the shelter offers a 1 week trial period for all animals 
 if the animal does n't fit with your family or <unk> you can bring it back no questions asked but there is a fee of 75 dollars out of the original 250 that the animal costs 
 now our busiest time of year for pet <unk> are the holidays 
 not a surprise parents getting their children cats or dogs or whatever is normal 
 but it does n't always end up well 
 yesterday a woman that looked to be in her late <unk> early <unk> came in the store with a box 
 from now on we 'll call her ch 
 the conversation went like this : ch : 'hello 
 i got this kitten for my mother but she did n't like it 
 i remember somebody saying that i could give her back no questions asked 
 me : <unk> there 
 yes we do offer a one week trial period 
 do you have the papers so we can see the details of your adoption 
 ch : <unk> 
 let me just grab them from my purse ... there they are here you go 
 now at this point i 'm just thinking that this is going to be easy and fast 
 me : <unk> you so much 
 one moment while i read over it right off the bat i see that she <unk> the cat a week and a half ago 
 that 's alright i could make an exception 
 reading farther i see that the kitten was in perfect health 
 great so we should have no problem me : 'so i see you got this kitten a week and a half ago but i could make an exception just this once 
 is there any other reason you did n't want her anymore 
 ch : 'my mother said she keeps on <unk> and her fur is super matted 
 its a shame though she was so sweet 
 now that interested me 
 i opened up the box and what do you know there 's a kitten showing signs of abuse 
 blood on her fur and visible open <unk> 
 i told her i would be just a moment and took the poor thing to my sister to get some x-rays done 
 just by looking at her you can tell she was abused and the <unk> confirmed that her <unk> leg was broken 
 i go up to the woman and tell her what my sister told me 
 ch : 'are you accusing my mother of abusing this cat 
 thats absurd 
 me : <unk> i 'm only telling you the obvious 
 it 's obvious that this animal has been abused 
 there is evidence of somebody kicking her legs and its broken 
 that is why she <unk> 
 ch : 'how dare you 
 my mother does not abuse animals 
 i will just take that cat back thank you very much 
 me : 'i 'm sorry but i can not give you the kitten back 
 ch : 'i will sue you 
 where is the manager let me speak to the manager me : miss im the owner 
 please leave my store before i call the police 
 ch : 'no i will not leave you cant make me 
 by now my sister has called the police and after about ten minutes of trying to get this lady to leave the police show up 
 once we show them the evidence they arrest ch for animal abuse 
 i got a call later saying that she refused to pay the fine and is now looking at a month jail time 
 the kitten on the other hand is going to be just fine 
 a few weeks in a cast and a few stitches and she will be just fine 
 edit : wow i 'm so surprised this got so popular 
 i 'm on my lunch break at the moment and your comments are so heartwarming 
 i have many other stories for ya 'll and would love to share 
 my sister is actually going to be taking the cat for her three year old son since their old cat died about a year ago 
 they named her <unk> 
 : it never <unk> to amaze me how one can ask a person nicely to not punch a button that will piss off a lot of people at once 
 at my store when i work graveyard shifts i tend to clock in 15 minutes before my shift so i can get the 2pm to 10pm person out at 10 and not have them sit around waiting on me so they get out at <unk> 
 i do that because i also clock out at <unk> the next morning so i get my 8 hours for the day 
 saturday may <unk> 2015 at <unk> pm the headache started 
 while out checking the outside <unk> for any that may need changing i see a guy punch my emergency pump shut off button epsob which as the name implies immediately shuts down all of my gas pumps causing me to have to go reset them in the back office 
 after witnessing his action on my <unk> button i ask him not to do that again because of what it does 
 typical whatever reaction from him and he <unk> around the store for a few minutes 
 in that time he 's browsing i have 9 people come in that i already know will pay for gas first then wait to pump 
 i get a few of those customers out of the door and they start fueling when i ring up mr. <unk> 
 i tell him his total he pays apologizes for punching my epsob and leaves 
 a second after that all of the gas pump icons on my register 's screen go gray which means he hit the button again causing me to have to go reset my pumps again 
 after that is settled and i put the remaining <unk> of all 9 customers back on their pumps so they can finish fueling i go to clean up around the store typical things like mopping wiping things down facing my store all of that 
 around 11:30 a van pulls up and a group of hispanic male youths hop out and start standing on the sidewalk in front of my store 
 6 people are currently fueling at this point in time when my pump icons go gray yet again 
 i walk outside to see what was happening and they 're shoving each other having a good time ca n't fault them for enjoying themselves with a small bit of rough housing honestly 
 i ask them to move away from the button because one of them caused my pumps to go down 
 i hear numerous variations in spanish and english of i do n't understand what you 're saying '' typical response 
 one gives the thumbs up and they go huddle around their van for a few 
 i walk back in and resume cleaning only to have 4 people walk in visibly angry and all want to know what is wrong with their pumps 
 sure enough the icons are yet again <unk> out 
 causing me to go hit the pump reset button for the 4th time in only 2 hours into my shift 
 i apologize to these customers explain someone hit that no-no button and that i can fix the problem easily but ask for just a minute for the systems to <unk> 
 everyone 's good to go to finish their fueling until i see one of the hispanic youths walk up smack the button and just stands in front of my store grinning ear to ear 
 i do n't know what it is with people but that is just nonsense 
 i 'm quite glad it was a somewhat easy night was n't too happy about having to police my epsob for about a half hour though 
 edit : saturday was may <unk> not the <unk> 
 i should n't type things when i get home i <unk> context : recently our managers decided that they were n't going to look up purchase history unless they really had to because the system is slow and they have more important things to do 
 we used to just have an unwritten policy that we would n't outright tell customers we could do it unless they asked but that 's since changed to us having to play press secretary and weaseling our way out of it 
 it has n't been fun 
 that said this happened last night at my warehouse club probably about twenty minutes to closing 
 we still had some people in the store which is typical and not bothersome and three guys who are about thirty come up to my counter 
 one shall be named adamant dude 
 & gt me : hi how can i help you 
 ad sets a perfectly folded dress shirt on the counter 
 & gt ad : hi yes 
 i would like to return this 
 & gt me : sure no problem 
 do you have your membership card 
 he sets it down on the counter and also tells me he has no receipt 
 & gt me : not a problem 
 is store credit okay 
 & gt ad : well i would really prefer back on my card but if not that 's fine 
 & gt me : okay great 
 as long as it 's within 90 days of purchase it 's not a problem 
 & gt ad : it should be yes 
 so far so good right 
 well if that was the case i would n't be writing this now would i 
 i begin looking around the shirt for the price tag which seems to be missing 
 i start squeezing the shirt all around and still ca n't find anything 
 i look up the brand in the computer but the closest thing we have is an article number for a discontinued <unk> dress shirt and the one he gave me is solid green 
 if he bought this shirt from us it 's no longer in our system 
 fudge 
 & gt me : you would n't happen to have the price tag with you would you 
 & gt ad : no i 'm afraid not 
 you must have my purchase history on my card right 
 you can look it up 
 & gt me : i ca n't sorry 
 i do n't have access to that 
 & gt ad : well get me somebody who can 
 i do n't care if it 's a manager or corporate somebody can do it 
 internal sigh oh jesus ... & gt me : just a moment let me get my walkie 
 into walkie hey lp 
 call me at the desk real quick 
 the discussion is basically my lp manager telling me to tell him i ca n't do the refund but that she 'll be up there soon enough anyway 
 & gt me : okay sir i 'm sorry but i ca n't do the refund 
 & gt ad : what do you mean you ca n't do the refund 
 you do n't understand 
 i want my money back 
 you can give me my refund i know you can 
 and here ladies and gentlemen is where i became a man 
 & gt me : no sir you do n't understand 
 i 'm an hourly employee 
 i do n't have access to information as sensitive as purchase history 
 i ca n't look it up for you 
 if i tried to do that i could lose my job 
 that said i 've got literally nothing to go on 
 i 've got no receipt i 've got no price tag i 've got nothing in the system that even matches the item you brought me so even if you had all those things you bought this shirt so long ago that the system would n't even recognize it as ours 
 so no i ca n't do your refund 
 ad and his friends stare at me like they got the wind knocked out of them 
 i raise my eyebrow 
 & gt ad : well i guess i 'll just come back tomorrow 
 i 'll keep it i guess see if my brother wants it 
 and then he lets out this oh so original gem 
 & gt ad : i guess i 'll just have to go down the street to competitor 's and shop there 
 & gt me : hah 
 have at it <unk> 
 you go right ahead 
 that said my manager will be here shortly if you want to see if she 'll do anything 
 & gt ad : no that 's okay 
 i 'm running late anyway 
 i have to go 
 and the guy and his friends leave unknowingly <unk> <unk> with my manager on the way out 
 and you know what guys 
 it felt <unk> posted previously about this manager i had 
 this girl was the <unk> of dumb blonde 
 like i said in the last post she did n't like to call the corporate line to have items in the store fixed 
 one of our light fixtures started to fall out of the ceiling hanging on by only the cord the light was attached to in the ceiling 
 it was a real eye sore and customers would crack jokes about it 
 one day she comes to me the <unk> person working that day and asks if i 'll fix it if she gets me the tools 
 i oblige and off she goes to the back room 
 maybe 5 minutes later she returns 
 with a glue stick 
 i had to hold my tongue and think long and hard about how to approach 
 in fact i 'm sure i gave her 30 seconds of the stupid blink 
 & gt manager i do n't think that will work 
 she looks at the glue stick and replies : & gt it says it 's permanent 
 <unk> vapid blink <unk> i take more deep <unk> 
 & gt manager glue sticks wo n't even hold my craft paper together 
 she just turned and disappeared back into the back room 
 i could no longer contain my fit of laughter 
 when we met with our dm to talk about why she was n't fit to run our store i <unk> this story 
 i told him i did n't feel any confidence in a manager like that 
 and this was my favorite story about her 
 tonight i was manning the register at the local <unk> lab <unk> from hell 
 a couple of old ones came in with their demon spawn 
 i could hear his cries throughout the entire temple 
 that is until he found the sacred pedestal of toy cars 
 damn 
 double damn 
 this will ruin everything 
 i put it in the back of my mind and start the cleansing ritual for the night 
 after a while the old ones demon spawn in tow come up to my magic box to check out 
 all the while the demonic child screams <unk> curses little yellow car in hand 
 & gt <unk> <unk> buy me this car wgah'nagl fhtagn the old ones are not pleased and he is denied his prize 
 fits were had 
 <unk> screams echoed throughout 
 the car is <unk> tossed in a bin of candy by the register 
 i think nothing of it 
 the old ones finished paying and the demon spawn is oddly silent 
 i must finish the cleansing so i bid them farewell and walk to the other side of the counter to finish my task 
 i finish up my task and decide i should begin the cleansing again 
 but first 
 i must retrieve the <unk> car the idol must be placed back on it 's pedestal 
 i must finish the sacred <unk> of cleansing or i 'll be put to the fire 
 i reach for the idol and am denied 
 it 's gone 
 i curse the demon spawn and move to assess the damages 
 the temple lies in <unk> 
 cars everywhere dozens of them 
 damn 
 i quickly <unk> the cleansing and go to let the elder gods know what has transpired 
 the elder gods <unk> the <unk> and peer into the past 
 as the old ones are leaving the demon spawn stays behind 
 he picks up the car and puts his arms behind his back hiding his shame from the old ones 
 that little shit 
 he stole one of the <unk> 
 luckily the elder gods do not put me to the fire 
 they quickly magic up an image of the old ones and bestow upon me the gift of power 
 i am to banish the old ones and their demon spawn if they dare to set foot in the temple again 
 i am pleased 
 mostly pleased that i am not on fire.i used to work at a fairly large grocery chain as a cashier 
 there are a few incidents that i remember but this is one of the worst 
 one day i was very tired at work 
 ca n't remember why but i think it involved an <unk> 
 however i was still doing my very best to do my job well 
 i prided myself in my good speed and service 
 the problem is you could very easily tell i was tired <unk> etc 
 so i was putting through customers like normal and i had just finished one order and was starting the next one 
 i scanned the bacon at the start of her order when she told me that it was n't her bacon 
 i realized that it must have fallen over the <unk> from the previous order and i stopped the woman before she left the lane 
 it was in fact hers and it turned out that she had balanced it on top of her cereal boxes so when the belt moved it fell back 
 no problem i put it through as a separate order and rang it up 
 nothing out of the ordinary right 
 except then she turned to me as she left and said & gt you know just because you 're tired does n't give you an excuse to do a bad job 
 hearing that when i was that tired almost made me have a breakdown 
 next story - & gt i work at a pizza place 
 guy comes in middle ages hispanic guy 
 me : are you here for a pickup '' 
 guy : yes name is it done yet '' 
 me : yes it is sir it 'll be $ <unk> '' 
 he takes this massive wad of cash held together somehow by this money clip takes out all of the hundreds and fifties that are tightly bunched together around it 
 starts counting them 
 mind you we ca n't take hundreds nor fifties 
 however he was being such a douche about counting them slowly while licking his finger and repeat that i let him go on 
 i let him go for about a minute or two turns out there 's about $ <unk> in this wad of cash 
 finally hands me one <unk> bill 
 i felt so great while i said 
 me : i 'm sorry sir we can not take fifties '' guy : alright '' hands me a hundred me : '' sorry no hundreds either '' guy : why the fuck wouldnt you tell me that while im counting all my hundreds '' 
 me : do you have any other form of payment '' 
 guy : bullshit where 's your manager '' me : hey managers name do we take hundreds or fifties '' 
 manager : no we ca n't company policy '' keep in mind this fiasco has lasted 4 minutes now pizza on the counter is getting cold 
 guy : while taking out a twenty from his pocket in all of 3 seconds 
 fine here you go '' lesson learned : do n't be a dick about paying with hundred dollar bills you 're not cool or anything 
 or i will inconvenience <unk> was an incident regarding a customer touching a coworker who we 'll call sammy 
 obviously sammy did n't like the touching that was going on light touches to her waist and hips shoulders so she told her mother who also works at the store 
 the mother who we shall call ingrid filed a sexual harassment claim 
 some legal stuff went down and the dude was ordered to pay compensation to the tune of $ <unk> 
 yesterday i 'm in the employee lounge clocking off from work chatting to ingrid before leaving 
 i 've gone maybe two steps before a regular customer spots ingrid inside walks past me opens the door and lets fly 
 a customer going into the employee lounge alone is a big <unk> no no 
 we rarely allow customers to use the bathroom if they are desperate but an employee always accompanies them 
 so i rush back inside to hear them exchange raised voices about this harassment report 
 & gt customer : you are a scammer 
 my husband only touched her shoulder 
 & gt ingrid : there is camera footage of there being a whole lot more than that going on 
 check your <unk> before you come in here blue in the face 
 & gt customer : i 'm a regular customer 
 sammy knows me 
 & gt ingrid : nobody touches an employee 
 nobody 
 get out of my workplace now 
 they go back and forth with a coworker and i caught between until the customer eventually leaves 
 ingrid fumes in the break room and i track down the manager and explain the ordeal 
 the manager kim is never afraid to put customers in their place and she was pissed 
 she stormed into the break room asked what happened and then tried finding the customer to no avail 
 the customer was immediately banned from the store for verbal assault of an employee and we were told to use the distress call over the pa if we ever see her 
 i saw her today 
 i make the call and the manager storms out to where i pointed 
 words are exchanged and the customer <unk> i 'm a regular customer '' 
 as cool as ice kim says not anymore 
 get out '' 
 the kicker 
 the cream of the crop 
 the report was filed and dealt with <unk> years ago 
 * **tl dr : a man was found guilty of sexual harassment of an employee and had to pay compensation 
 two years later his wife <unk> attacks the employee 's mother in the employee lounge 
 she is banned and kicked out the next day by the manager 
 <unk> i do work in retail in a fairly large supermarket i 've never really had a customer complain 
 however on a rare day off i managed to somehow attract an irate customer 
 my mum turned 48 last friday and i was able to wrangle the day off to take her out 
 she loves antiques and quirky <unk> things so i took her out and told her i 'd buy her one such item 
 there 's a good few shops <unk> in funky antiques and whatever else in a nearby seaside town so we went there for the day 
 we were in one of these shops and there was only one other customer looking around in the same room as us whilst the owner was in the next room with another customer 
 while looking my mum found a fireguard that she wanted 
 i told her i thought it would look great in the living room but it would be much too heavy to take home on the train 
 there was a sign at the till detailing the prices for local delivery free if you spent over <unk> £5 if not which i read to my mum before continuing browsing on my own while she went into the next room 
 recalling the situation <unk> the other customer in the room must of heard me telling my mum the prices and thought i worked there not knowing we were mother and daughter 
 as i wandered back across the room the customer grabbed me and this pleasant exchange came to happen 
 this customer shall be called rb short for rude bitch 
 **rb : ** you 
 get me a box now 
 these delivery prices are <unk> and i simply refuse to pay them 
 **me : ** * i laugh rudely realising what 's happened but decide to have some fun 
 * it 's hardly as if i set the prices is it 
 **rb : ** you your manager whoever 
 i do n't care 
 if you do n't have a box then perhaps pop over to the business next door and get one 
 **me : ** what makes you think it 's my job to 
 **rb : ** as a sales assistant i 'm certain you should be <unk> me and helping me meet my needs 
 listen i 'm not paying for delivery just get me a box and i 'll happily carry the fucking <unk> home 
 **me : ** i do n't even live in this town nor do i work in this shop or even have the <unk> interest in doing so 
 but if i did work here this would be the part where i refuse a sale and tell you to fuck off 
 sadly i 'm just another customer like you so i ca n't really do that 
 my mum and the owner then walked back in the room 
 the owner shot rb a death glare and simply said i 'm the manager i can tell you to do *exactly* that 
 on your way please '' 
 as rb did the walk of shame out of the door the owner me to choose something to keep for free as an apology for my terrible shopping experience in her shop 
 this story takes place a year or so ago while i was working at a drug store 
 i was working a front register when a gentleman comes up with a green dot card a prepaid visa debit card 
 i give him our welcome spiel and ask him : & gt **me : ** how much would you like on the card sir 
 & gt **customer : ** $ 500 he then hands me a credit card 
 when purchasing a green dot card with a credit card you need to have a valid form of id so we can verify that the name on your id matches that of the credit card you’re using 
 & gt **me : ** do you have your id on you 
 & gt **customer : ** yup here you go 
 i take one look at the id and i 'm baffled because ... it’s not him 
 it’s clearly not him 
 the man before me was approximately <unk> naturally tanned skin and had a mustache 
 the man in the id on the other hand was white with a height of 6’ 
 i take the credit card to <unk> the names and they were a match 
 this guy was clearly in possession of someone else 's id and credit card 
 & gt **me : ** sir ... this isn’t you 
 & gt **customer : ** excuse me 
 & gt **me : ** sir it’s obvious that the man in this picture isn’t you 
 & gt **customer : ** it is me 
 how dare you 
 give me back my cards 
 fuck that 
 i slide the cards out of his reach and page for my manager 
 he arrives <unk> and i calmly explain the situation 
 & gt **me : ** he’s trying to buy a green dot card but the id he gave <unk> & gt **customer : ** this is me 
 i want my id and credit card back 
 why won’t you give them back 
 the customer is starting to lose his cool and is clearly agitated 
 my manager says nothing as he looks at the id and back at the customer 
 & gt **manager : ** ... this isn’t you & gt **customer : ** yes 
 it 
 is 
 this goes back and forth for quite a while when finally he drops this line : & gt **customer : ** i just do n't understand why you wo n't give me my cards back 
 & gt **manager : ** because i ca n't give you back property that is n't yours 
 & gt **customer : ** you have every right to think that 's not me but it is me 
 you ca n't just take my cards like this 
 & gt **manager : ** well i’m going to call the cops and– the instance the word <unk> leaves my managers lips the customer bolts to the exit runs to his car and does a 180 degree turn in the middle of a busy street 
 he puts the <unk> to the metal and his car goes screeching down the street 
 my manager told me i did a good job and i 'm sure he was in contact with the police shortly afterwards about the stolen id and credit card 
 i had my credit card info stolen before so it felt so good to protect someone else from it 
 there 's this married couple that comes into my store every monday morning that i absolutely adore 
 i adore them so much that i 'm actually nice to them 
 and they come in every monday morning without fail 
 it 's honestly the best part of my work week 
 this couple is a dream couple 
 they 're always smiling 
 they always purchase something 
 they treat me like a human being 
 it 's amazing 
 usually this is the part of the story where something goes horrible wrong but have faith 
 we recently had our annual let 's throw every piece of shit in our warehouse on the sales floor '' sale 
 monday morning after the sale which started on saturday and the sale area looks like the aftermath of a lion 's feast on the savannah 
 my monday morning couple waltzes in with smiles and decide to brave the vultures and see if there 's anything left 
 happily they found a couple of the things including a hoe that was marked down to a dollar 
 now the wife always gets super excited about everything she purchases but she 's besides herself today 
 *wife : good morning dear 
 how was your weekend 
 * *me : actually not terrible 
 only two fights broke out during the sale 
 * *wife : oh 
 that 's a bit down from last year 
 six fights and someone <unk> over a pregnant cashier * *me : yes i was impressed 
 * i begin ringing her up as her and her husband chatter about their weekend to me and ask about my boyfriend 
 i get to the last item the hoe and the wife gets very excited 
 *wife : i ca n't believe this deal 
 one dollar for a hoe 
 where else can you get a hoe for one dollar 
 * her husband walks away unable to control himself laughing as i smile at her 
 *me : i 'm sure you could probably find one on a city corner if you know where to look 
 * so i just started working at a chain pet store last week 
 i 've never done retail before so they train me and put me on cashier during a slow bit 
 i have a woman come up with one of our adoption books 
 it 's a coupon book that you get when you adopt an animal has something like $ 200 worth of coupons 
 so i 'm checking her out and scanning her stuff as she 's tearing coupons out 
 me will be me lf will be her for liar face 
 & gt lf : i 've got these coupons for that hold on let me tear them out 
 & gt me : okay no hurry 
 i need to finish scanning your items before i scan the coupons in anyway 
 & gt lf : i did n't actually adopt a dog you know 
 & gt me : okay ... we usually give out the adoption books when you adopt the dog with one of our <unk> so i 'm really confused at this point 
 & gt lf : i was going to but the rescue was so paranoid asking all these questions and demanding to see my <unk> and whether i had a fence 
 okay yeah 
 those things are kind of important 
 do n't want the dog getting dumped if you do n't have permission from a landlord and they find out or getting hit by a car when they escape because you do n't have a fence makes sense to me 
 & gt lf : so i bought a dog from a <unk> and kept the coupon book 
 it 's not like my landlord ever comes around anyway 
 what the fuck lady 
 so you ca n't have a dog 
 & gt lf : anyway do these coupons work for that stuff 
 *handing me a stack of <unk> & gt me : yeah 
 *scans them <unk> <unk> for her to <unk> <unk> receipt* you saved $ 37 dollars today 
 have a nice day 
 by lying 
 you saved $ 37 by lying 
 i really hope that dog ends up okay but judging by the type of person you are i 'm not holding my breath 
 i 'm not mad about the coupons 
 whatever 
 but really 
 why would you tell me all this 
 liar <unk> manager here 
 i 'm part of a team <unk> of other managers from our market to help relocate one of our stores 
 today i was helping with merch transfers out of the old location so it was one of those rare <unk> days 
 the phone was the only place that the outside world could reach in as we scanned away 
 and reach in oh it did 
 the gm heading our efforts takes a call on speakerphone 
 he 's a great guy who can take a lot of bs without getting bothered 
 customer : hi i need the men 's department 
 note : we have departments but not exactly people <unk> each department separately 
 gm : i 'm sorry this location is closed 
 we 've <unk> to -- -- 
 customer : and you 're telling me this because ... 
 gm : ... i was going to give you their number 
 customer : why ca n't you just check 
 gm : i do n't have anything to check for you 
 would you like to call our new location 
 customer : i need the men 's department 
 gm : we do n't have any departments here 
 do you want the new phone number or not 
 customer : just connect me then 
 my god are you stupid or something 
 gm : okay just a sec 
 click 
 gm hangs up 
 laughter throughout the empty store <unk> 
 tl dr : man thinks a closed store will sell him things 
 gm does not agree.i recently got hired at a store that buys and sells used dvds cds games etc 
 i love it it 's honestly the best job i 've had minus my manager <unk> me on facebook when i 'm not at work but i still dig 
 so the other day it was about an hour and a half before closing and i was getting ready to ring someone up 
 the customer pointed out to me that one of the games he was purchasing had the disc inside note that we take everything out but inserts and then put them on the sales floor so that the <unk> are behind the counter 
 i looked at a coworker and questioned if someone might have passed it up or something and then the customer interrupted me by saying & gt '' so since the disc is in there do i get it for free '' 
 i was baffled you 're asking me that because the product is in its case you get it for free back around <unk> at $ fastfood 
 i 'm on drive through everything 's normal cars are going through like clock work 
 & gt me : thank you for coming to $ fastfood how may i help you today 
 & gt $ <unk> : yes i 'd like a number 1 a number 6 ... and a chinese chicken salad 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry sir what was that last item 
 & gt $ ttc : the chinese chicken salad 
 <unk> ... that 's what i thought you said 
 odd i 've been here for a year now and that item simply does n't exist 
 * & gt me : i 'm sorry sir but we do n't have that item on our menu 
 & gt $ ttc : no you do 
 i got it here just yesterday 
 & gt me : did you get it from this $ location 
 i was on drive through yesterday as well and the only salads we have are % salad1 and % <unk> 
 & gt $ ttc : no i got it just earlier this week 
 are you sure you do n't have it 
 are you new by chance 
 & gt me : i 've been working here over a year sir and yes i 'm quite sure we do n't have any kind of chinese chicken salad '' 
 *seriously it 's my job to sell it to you i get kudos from my boss if i can get you to upgrade the side salad to a full salad 
 if we had it i would sell the hell out of that thing 
 * & gt $ ttc one sec let me call my wife 
 me : *screaming internally then audibly but <unk> & gt $ ttc : *hey honey they do n't have your salad anymore 
 no i know 
 i know it 's your favorite 
 yes i tried that 
 about a year at least 
 they have ... * he then proceeds to read the menu to his wife *while still in drive <unk> 
 $ <unk> walks by 
 & gt $ sm : <unk> 
 me : yes 
 i know 
 i can only go as fast as the customers this guy is on the phone with his wife explaining our menu 
 i ca n't do anything 
 & gt $ sm : line line line 
 in the most annoying high pitched yell you can imagine 
 as if reminding me that there 's a line i ca n't do anything about will somehow make the customer move faster 
 & gt $ <unk> : okay 
 she 'll just have a <unk> 
 <unk> after the line died down i went from a one car wait to a 7 car wait because of this guy i asked my manager when that item was discontinued 
 3 years before i started working there 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven 
 i 've posted a few other stories here if you 're interested 
 **story : ** i setup in a smaller city in central florida and i go through the local police department to hire off duty officers for security when the tent is really busy 
 the officers love the duty shift since it’s usually just getting paid to sit around and bs with my dad eat my mom’s fantastic cajun food seriously we now post a menu when we post the signup sheet and make sure that any thief or idiot thinks twice before doing something stupid 
 i’m basically paying for peace of mind and to support local law enforcement always a good idea if you’re a business owner 
 over the years we’ve become good friends with several of the police officers and it’s not uncommon for the officer s on duty to swing by and say hello 
 when they are working security for us they are officially “off duty” with the city but for a police officer “off duty” is a relative term 
 they’re still in uniform and in communication via radio 
 here are a few of the crazy things involving our <unk> <unk> that have happened over the years 
 <unk> 
 ** the officer was talking with a few customers when a call came over his radio 
 he jumped up ran to his car and peeled out of the parking lot 
 someone had robbed the bank across the street and about a half block down from us 
 we can actually see the front door of the bank from inside the tent 
 the officer arrived at the bank just as the robber was taking off in his car 
 the officer forced him off the road and they busted him a few blocks away 
 **2 
 ** i’m setup in the parking lot of a large shopping center 
 a manager from one of the businesses saw the police car parked by my tent and walked over to complain to the officer about a van parked across the lot near his store 
 it was apparently abandoned there a week ago and was partially blocking one of the rows 
 when the officer walked over to investigate he discovered the owner had od’d inside the van a week ago 
 he spent the rest of the day overseeing the investigation and <unk> 
 <unk> 
 ** i was running errands and passed by the tent when i saw three police cars and the fire marshall truck parked next to it 
 i panicked and did a <unk> so i could find out what was going on 
 pulled into the parking lot like a maniac and rushed to the tent 
 mom had made gumbo 
 there were two officers that that just gotten off duty and one of the on duty officers having lunch 
 the fire marshall had seen the police cars and stopped in to see what was up 
 i needed a new pair of underwear 
 **4 
 ** the officer was sitting a table with my dad having lunch when his radio went off 
 bank robbery 
 same bank 5 months later 
 the robber had already fled the scene when the call came through 
 our officer left to help in the search 
 i think they caught the guy a couple of weeks later 
 <unk> 
 ** a police officer we know stopped by one evening to let me know that someone had used a stolen credit card at my store that day 
 a woman couldn’t find her purse and had called the credit card company 
 the cc company gave her a list of charges that had been done that day on her card and she contacted the police 
 it was a big purchase around $ 750 and fortunately the cashier remembered the couple that had used the card 
 the police took both of our statements 
 four days later the couple walks into our tent again and starts to shop 
 the cashier immediately recognized them and grabbed me to let me know 
 we actually had an officer on site for security at the time and i quietly let her know the thieves were back 
 she stepped out of the tent and called for backup on the radio 
 there were a couple dozen people shopping at the time including 5 or 6 kids 
 i decided to demo a fountain in the parking lot so we rounded up all the kids and had them leave the tent to go and watch 
 four police officers <unk> in and busted the couple 
 they didn’t put up a fight 
 they found 12 stolen purses in their car and lots of merchandise including my fireworks 
 i was one of several companies to press charges 
 they ended up taking a plea and are still in <unk> as far as i know 
 to this day i am still amazed that they had to balls to walk right past the police officer at our door after ripping me off a few days earlier 
 <unk> quick follow up and vent by me ... ** the stolen fireworks were seized as evidence 
 after the thieves took a plea deal the day of the trial all of the stolen merchandise including the fireworks were <unk> by the judge to the families of the <unk> 
 that’s <unk> judge gave all of the stolen merchandise to the families of the thieves 
 they had hit almost a dozen stores 
 i think they hit <unk> for more than 5k including gift cards 
 while we <unk> our local law enforcement not really a big fan of the court system 
 i spent hours doing statements interviews and <unk> 
 as a reward i was ripped off again this time by the court system 
 apologies for the rant 
 this happened yesterday and while its not very exciting i just wanted to share 
 so i work 2 different retail jobs 
 one of which is a big red office supply store 
 saturday and sunday we had a special coupon where if you brought it in ... .you got a free case of water ... no purchase necessary 
 does n't sound that bad right 
 except for the fact that customers are only allowed one coupon per person per day 
 and management is super strict about it 
 i know that even the <unk> of people would try to take advantage but i also live in a low income area where we have a flea market <unk> down the street 
 any deals we have people come get our cheap shit and re-sell it for a higher price 
 so anyway all day people came into the store 
 i greeted them some greeted me back 
 but mostly they ignored me and grabbed the water by the door 
 came to my register and walked out 
 we had entire families come in each holding a coupon 
 im talking 8 person groups 
 and then it happened 
 a couple came in both with coupon in hand 
 they each came up 
 first the woman who awkwardly asked some questions 
 then her boyfriend who didnt even glance at me 
 i told them to have a great day and they left 
 a few minutes pass and a couple comes up 
 its a little busy in the store and i am the only cashier scheduled for the day so i was n't really paying attention but the couple looked oddly familiar 
 they walked out with water 
 my general manager walks up and says those people already got water 
 make sure that doesnt happen again 
 its one per person 
 they just had different coats on '' 
 after those words left his lips guess who walks back in 
 general manager : sir 
 you guys already got water twice 
 you 're done for the day 
 its one per customer 
 water guy : you 're gon na deny me my coupon 
 i am a new customer 
 i just came in 
 gm : sir just because you 're now wearing a hat does n't mean you 're a different <unk> retail all has been seen 
 this is one of those wait ... what '' 
 types of moments 
 it was a quiet day in the photo lab and my friend and i were just hanging out talking when this old man comes up to us : me : can i help you 
 man : yeah i have a complaint 
 me : ok what 's up 
 man : the pharmacy would n't take my stool sample 
 *customer was holding a film canister example click me me : *i guess he thinks i 'm the pharmacist because i 'm wearing a white coat* <unk> think i can call an assistant manager over if you 'd like ... <unk> to ... .. 
 man : no that 's ok you 're good enough to talk to 
 me : <unk> really ca n't help you out i 'm just a <unk> man : listen can you just take a look for me <unk> the old man opens the canister and pours the stool on my counter* me : *immediately snap my head up to the ceiling slowly bringing my head back down to assess what this crazy old guy just <unk> man : <unk> yes folks this old man in fact did leave stool on my counter 
 but not what you 're thinking 
 it was a little replica of a bar stool that he put inside the canister and let it stand as soon as it came out of the canister 
 i went from a near <unk> to a laughing fit 
 sure it was <unk> but hell if it was n't original 
 in fact this guy used to come in with his wife a lot and anytime he saw someone in a not-so-good or just stressed mood he 'd always come to talk to you or even tell you a sure they were <unk> a joke to brighten up your day 
 it was people like him that i used to really love dealing with one that could assure you things could be a lot worse 
 it was actually that particular day that really taught me how to <unk> up in the worse of situations 
 tl dr- paper <unk> can not carry passengers i broke my screwdriver what happened to the bowl of macaroni 
 it was right there 
 stop being lazy and just read it already 
 : <unk> again 
 the other day i shared a story from my current job as a <unk> cashier 
 here 's a far less bizarre but still pretty bizarre story from my days as a barista at a national coffee chain you 're probably familiar with 
 this happened in <unk> lady walks in at a slow time for the store so i 'm as cheery as can be since i have nothing particularly stressful going on 
 first thing debbie downer says to me is wipe that smile off your face and take my order '' 
 yes really 
 so i immediately do as instructed since there 's no way i can stay happy after such a <unk> comment 
 what 's wrong with people 
 anyway debbie places a very complicated order 
 no problem 
 i make a lot of complicated drinks all day 
 the problem 
 she has the audacity to <unk> that i 'm going too slow 
 what the hell lady 
 so i go even faster for the witch just to get her <unk> out of my hair hand the drink to her and she sits down 
 a couple minutes pass and she gets up slams the empty cup on my counter and says : & gt since you 're not doing anything useful right now you can be a good girl and throw this away for me 
 oh and the coffee was sh*t. i wo n't be coming back 
 she came back several times after that always requesting someone else serve her when i was working 
 never did figure out why she hated me 
 edit : omg 
 thanks for all the votes and tfr quote of the day everyone 
 i 'll post one more story about my time at this coffee shop as a thank you 
 expect that <unk> store price matches branded items with all other shops in the town 
 the signs are everywhere and the small print price matching only on non-own brand products at shops and supermarkets within 5 miles is actually <unk> from a distance not to mention in plain sight at my customer service desk 
 on sunday i had a family walk in and make straight for my desk 
 mother was a short dumpy woman with a facial expression like a <unk> <unk> a <unk> 
 father was giving me the evil look and the two kids looked as if someone needed to scrub them from head to toe in <unk> 
 i put on my best professional smile 
 & gt mother : you price match right 
 & gt me that 's correct 
 we match on all branded items within ... & gt mother : good 
 i ordered this freezer last week and my neighbour has just got it for a quarter less than i paid 
 & gt me : ok. do you know where your neighbour got it from 
 & gt mother : yes 
 *name of major on-line only <unk> 
 it 's good quality too because it says grade a. i mentally facepalm 
 & gt me : the price matching does n't include online retailers as they are always cheaper because they do n't have stores to rent or buy 
 we only price match new equipment bought at shops within 5 miles as per all the signs 
 & gt father : not good enough 
 we 're on a tight budget and ca n't really afford to waste money 
 you 're refusing me my price match so i want to see your manager 
 & gt me : i 'll page her for you but i dare say she 'll tell you the same thing 
 tl dr. family want a price match on new appliance against a <unk> online <unk> work at a big box electronics store and i recently encountered an older woman who asked for my help in finding a specific game for the pc that her grandson wanted for christmas 
 the following is roughly what transpired : **me** : can i help you find anything 
 **customer** : yes i 'm trying to find a game for my grandson for christmas and i was wondering if you had <unk> <unk> apple windows 8**** 
 ** '' **me** : uhh ... **customer** : do you not have it 
 **me** : well ma'am that game does n't exist 
 what you just described were several companies followed by windows 8 
 **customer** : & lt looks at handwritten note in her hand & gt **me** : i think your grandson may have written the possible computers that the game can run on instead of the title of the game 
 **customer** : doing a literal facepalm oh my god **me** : yeah ... **customer** : there 's no way you could narrow it down to what game he wanted is there 
 **me** : well ... not really considering that kind of describes most of the games we have in the store for the pc ... in the end i ended up suggesting a gift card and the woman went on her way 
 welcome back to hypermarket 
 we 're so glad you 're here 
 let me take you back to the wild heady days of <unk> i was younger then and full of hope 
 and other than a guy snapping at me over us being out of eggnog on christmas eve i had n't yet had a truly outrageous customer interaction 
 until this lady 
 there i was in my <unk> scanning and bagging like a good little retail drone 
 groceries come down the <unk> i scan and bag them 
 scan-scan bag-bag 
 i had a good rhythm going and it was a good day 
 and then her milk turned up 
 two <unk> <unk> of 2 % scan-scan bag-bag 
 two <unk> of chocolate milk scan-scan bag-bag 
 and then the customer spoke up 
 c : that was really insensitive you know '' 
 me : <unk> <unk> i 'm sorry '' 
 c : <unk> <unk> what you just did 
 that was extremely insensitive '' 
 me : *still confused* i 'm sorry if i upset you ma'am but what did i do '' 
 i will never ever forget her response 
 c : my milk 
 you put the white milk and the chocolate milk in different bags 
 you segregated my milk '' 
 me : er ... i 'm sorry ma'am 
 i was n't even thinking about what kinds of milk they were i just bagged them in the order they came down the belt ... '' c : well you <unk> have thought about it 
 you 're lucky if i do n't tell your manager about how racist you just were '' 
 me : in my head *oh please lady please talk to her 
 i want to see the look on my manager 's face when you tell her i was racist to your milk 
 * she glared at me through the rest of the transaction and <unk> me to think about what i said '' when she left 
 i never saw her again i do n't know if she was just passing through the area that day or if she avoided my line afterwards so she would n't be <unk> to my horrible <unk> 
 * '' you segregated my milk 
 *i live near <unk> and today was a pretty damn hot day <unk> about uh 98f 
 we had a full fire alert for the state and it was hot even at 9am 
 thankfully i was working today so i was able to enjoy the ac in the store 
 it 's business as usual with a hot <unk> being the ridiculous weather 
 we had some customers linger and take their time getting their carts because they just did not want to leave 
 i suddenly hear my manager and a coworker exclaiming in a <unk> what 
 there 's a child in a car '' 
 and racing outside to try and find the vehicle 
 middle of the day sun fully blazing and there 's a fucking kid locked in a car 
 the woman i 'm serving suddenly gets quiet her head down and rather impatient to get through checkout 
 it dawns on me - the mother is the woman i 'm serving 
 knowing i would get into shit if i blatantly confronted her regardless of how angry it made me i used it as a conversation 
 me : gee that 's so irresponsible hey 
 imagine someone leaving their child in a car on a day like this 
 so many news stories and <unk> from emergency personnel to not do it and this *mother* does it on the <unk> october day in 70 years 
 sheesh 
 some people should n't be parents '' 
 the woman mumbles and nods and becomes more impatient 
 i quickly get through the rest of her items and send her on her way gesturing her to the coworkers as she rushes out the door with her tail between her legs 
 stupid bitch 
 there 's no other word for it 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 3200 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new year’s eve 
 **story : ** for some reason there were a lot of temper <unk> at the fireworks tent this year 
 i seriously think some of our customers push us just to see how far they can go 
 i am generally <unk> and it takes a lot of pushing to get me <unk> up 
 my dad ... not so much 
 i got to witness this story <unk> which is always a treat 
 my dad was showing around a customer explaining what the different fireworks did and showing him videos of the <unk> 
 the entire time the guy is complaining about our prices 
 he tells my dad that there 's a firework store a couple of hours away that has much lower prices on everything we sell 
 no big deal 
 we hear that so often that it does n't even <unk> us anymore 
 we get a lot of people fishing for a deal 
 this guy goes on for probably a good 10 minutes about how great this other place was with my dad holding his tongue and trying to be nice to the guy 
 my dad is showing the guy an amazing finale cake when the guy interrupts and says that he used to buy it for half that price at the other store 
 the guy went off claiming that this was one of his favorite <unk> and that he used to get that exact same finale for $ 49 at the other store 
 now my dad and i both know that this guy is totally full of shit 
 there may in fact be other stores that sell fireworks for less than we do 
 i try my best to price my items lower than the competition but it could happen 
 more importantly the finale in question was <unk> for 2014 so there 's no way in hell this guy have ever purchased it before 
 my father calmly pointed out that the finale costs $ <unk> at our store but was buy one get one free 
 if you just want one we 'll do any item at half-price so the actual cost of the item would only be $ 45 if he wanted one 
 the guy paused for a moment obviously missing the fact that all of our items were buy one get one free 
 after a few seconds he regained his composure and shot back with : **guy : ** yeah but that other store gives you tons of free fireworks 
 if i spent $ 200 they would throw in $ 600 worth of free stuff 
 **dad : ** i’m not sure why you ever left that store 
 hell you probably should have moved in there 
 in fact if i were you i’d get in my car and drive over there right now 
 **guy : ** what 
 **dad : ** i know you’ve got a long drive ahead of you 
 i won’t hold you up any longer 
 good luck 
 with that my dad turned around and walked away leaving the guy standing there with a confused look on his face 
 the guy picked out some fireworks paid and left without saying anything else to anyone 
 -- -- -- -- thanks for reading 
 missed you guys 
 but my real job is keeping me running these days 
 sorry it’s been so long but there are more updates to follow i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven with <unk> rack shelving and more than 300 items in stock 
 i make sure that my prices are the best around and i take a lot of pride in hand picking my inventory and selecting only the best stuff 
 i even have some items custom made and imported from china with my own label 
 what can i say i’m a pyromaniac 
 i’m a big <unk> in customer service and i make sure everyone that works for me knows that we take care of our customers 
 i want everyone to leave with a smile on their face 
 that being said sometimes you just can’t win 
 my parents are <unk> and my dad and mom help me out a lot at the fireworks tent 
 my dad is laid back and super friendly 
 he does an amazing job chatting up the customers and helping them out 
 one day this <unk> bh strolls in and starts browsing the shelves 
 i’m behind the counter but my dad <unk> the guy and asks if he needs any help 
 bh mumbles no and starts walking around the shop 
 after a while i hear <unk> call out to my dad and say that our prices are way too expensive 
 not a big deal 
 this actually happens a lot with people trying to work a deal 
 my dad is super cool and tells bh that we’re always willing to match anyone else’s price for the same item 
 my dad walks over and i can hear bh telling my dad how we’re double the price he usually pays for the stuff 
 my dad and i both know this is bs but dad just keeps smiling and tells bh that we try to have the best prices and that he doesn’t know of anyone that is cheaper but we can beat their price if he can tell us who carries it for less or has an advertisement from the other company 
 this apparently pisses bh off 
 he <unk> his voice and starts ranting about how we’re too expensive pointing at items and telling us how much cheaper they are at his imaginary place 
 then this exchange takes place : bh : see this item right here pointing at one of our custom made pieces 
 i’ve bought this exact same item for less than half of this price 
 you guys are just trying to rip me off 
 i’m not going to pay that price for this thing 
 i’ll give you $ 20 and that’s more than it’s worth 
 dad : i’m pretty sure you didn’t get that particular item from anywhere else 
 we have it custom made for us 
 see how it even has our name on the label 
 bh : yelling bullshit 
 all of the stuff you’re carrying is junk 
 i can get this stuff cheaper anywhere 
 <unk> for another couple of minutes telling my dad that this company is a joke and that we’re lucky he’s even bothering to buy our crap 
 dad : cold as ice get the fu*k out 
 bh : yelling i’m going to have your ass fired old man 
 i walk out from behind the counter and over to where this is going on 
 i smile and tap bh on the shoulder 
 me : i’m sorry sir i own the business 
 how can i help you 
 bh : your employee was rude and just cussed at me 
 i can’t believe you have people like that working for you 
 me : i’m so sorry 
 what did he say to you 
 bh : he told me to get the fu*k out 
 me : are you sure 
 bh : yes 
 me : smiling then get the fu*k out 
 bh just stands there like he doesn’t understand what i’m saying 
 i point to the exit 
 he starts walking away cursing up a storm and yelling how he’s going to tell everyone what a horrible place this is 
 my dad and i are damn peeing ourselves laughing 
 this happened years ago but it’s still one of our favorite catch phrases at the tent 
 me : i need to run to the bank to get more <unk> 
 dad : then get the fu*k out 
 thanks for all of the fantastic comments 
 here 's a video i posted earlier where i accidentally '' blow up my buddy in a <unk> 
 adding a link to another fireworks story another tale from the cafe/shop combo in my home town 
 this time i was working in the cafe as a cashier and <unk> of sweet treats 
 me = me and ic = ignorant customer 
 & gt me : usual retail spiel how can i help you 
 etc 
 etc 
 & gt ic : a latte and a hot chocolate brownie thanks & gt me : okay your total is £x.xx 
 also the brownie is *very* hot so give it a minute to cool down & gt ic : okay thanks 
 she pays takes her things and sits down 
 all is going well i deliver her hot chocolate brownie then i hear a <unk> 
 & gt ic : <unk> ... <unk> in through mouth* fuckin <unk> words i can not <unk> a couple of seconds pass & gt ic : *while walking to the counter shouting* that brownie was <unk> hot 
 it scolded the inside of my fuckin mouth 
 you did n't tell me they were going to be that hot 
 & gt me : i 'm <unk> ... *she cuts in* & gt ic : what are you doing to them 
 you fuckin idiot you did n't tell me 
 & gt ic : *even louder* you have n't heard the last of this kid 
 what 's your name 
 i 'm going to call corporate give me their number now 
 & gt me : i 'm captain but we do n't have a corporate office here 's my managers number : redacted 
 however i *did* inform you that the <unk> chocolate brownie would be too hot to eat immediately 
 i 'm sorry you burnt your mouth but i d ... <unk> off again* & gt ic : no you did n't 
 i 'll make sure the likes of you are fired ... your manager will be hearing from my lawyer 
 she leaves while cussing all the way to the door 
 fortunately my manager always believes her employees first 
 the next day i was asked what happened i told her what had happened and she believed me 
 that was all i heard about it except my awesome manager shutting her down on the phone 
 i would <unk> that i forgot to warn her but i know i did 
 god i love retail ... in high school i was a cashier at a grocery store 
 because you 're here you know that just because someone is working as a cashier in a grocery store that they may be capable of <unk> thought 
 it 's too bad the customers do n't know this 
 so i had an older lady come through my line 
 i was polite asked her how she was doing etc 
 i am scanning her order and she has two packs of <unk> bags 
 they both ring up and she grabs one of the boxes from the belt after i 'd scanned it thrusts it in my face and uses one of her <unk> fingers to aggressively point at the print on the box which reads buy one get one free '' 
 she yells at me in the most derogatory way ca n't you read '' 
 of course i can read 
 have you noticed that the checkout terminal is full of text 
 anyway 
 i take the box from her knowing that when something is printed on the box like that it 's a manufacturer deal not a store deal so i 'm not at all surprised that it did not ring up 
 i read the text around the buy one get one free '' logo and point to the important part and say ma'am this is a manufacturer <unk> 
 you need to mail in both bar codes '' 
 she meekly apologized and then was quiet for the rest of the order while i <unk> in the glory of showing her what a complete asshat she <unk> i work in a pet store and one of the areas i cover is the fish department 
 for some reason people just do n't seem to care about the well being of fish as much as other animals and it 's part of my job to make sure any pet is going to a suitable home 
 when it comes to fish and the lack of empathy people have for them it can be difficult to walk the line of not pissing off customers and protecting the fish 
 some days i just do n't care about the customers though 
 the scene : young couple yg as the guy did all the talking in the fish department holding a <unk> gallon tank no filter and some gravel approach me 
 yg : hi we 'd like some help 
 me : sure what can i do for you 
 yg : we have a goldfish at home and we 're going to get this tank as an upgrade for it and we 'd like to buy another goldfish to go with him 
 *they were both all happy and smiles at this point* i already know i 'm about to piss these people off so i try to go about it in the nicest way possible me in my best i 'm a happy person that would love to help you '' voice : ok that tank is not going to be a suitable <unk> for one goldfish 
 they get big produce a lot waste and really need a big tank with proper <unk> 
 i can show you a tank that would work for the one goldfish that you already have 
 yg : <unk> completely gone now* what size tank will it need 
 me : a <unk> is the minimum tank size for a goldfish 
 yg : yeah we do n't really have room for that 
 wo n't it just grow to the size of the tank 
 me still trying to be polite : in a way yes 
 the fish 's growth will be <unk> the <unk> in the water can burn the fish 's <unk> and the lifespan of the fish is dramatically shorter as the small space and poor living conditions will kill it 
 a goldfish in a good size tank will grow to about 8-10 inches and live for about 20 years 
 yg : how long would it live in this size tank 
 me : the fish would be lucky to live a couple of years 
 yay 
 so far they have n't been rude or got mad annoyed but whatever 
 they 've listened to my whole spiel surely they understand now 
 ha ... the young guy looks at they young lady he 's with 
 she kind of <unk> her head to the side and says : i 'm ok with that 
 the yg nods on agreement and says : yeah i 'm ok with that too 
 *looks at me and <unk> yeah we 'll get another goldfish 
 me no more fucks to be given : no you wo n't 
 i have to make sure the animals are n't going to suffer once they leave the store i ca n't sell you one 
 cue awkward stare off at the end of which i remember that i 'm supposed to be nice and throw in a retail smile 
 yg : ok ... they took the upgrade tank '' and sat it on the counter we have in the fish department and walked out 
 i 'm glad none of my fish went with them but i still feel bad about the fish they <unk> the overwhelming amount of response from my last tale i figured i 'd share one that happened in my workplace a couple of months ago 
 a customer made my coworker an older lady in her 60s cry in the middle of the sales floor 
 it 's just another uneventful day in the store everyone is busy cleaning stocking refolding clothes and everything else that comes with working a small store 
 a customer suddenly walks in with her husband and i 'm not <unk> when i say she was the sweetest person i 've dealt with in my time at this store 
 so i greet her with the typical hey how are you doing 
 what brings you in today 
 and she makes the effort to ask me how my day 's going and starts a conversation 
 i help her out with what she needs to get we keep talking about school and how things are going with me and all of a sudden out walks my coworker we 'll call her susan 
 now susan is known by everyone who comes into the store 
 she just finished her 20th year here and she 's not leaving any time soon 
 she deals well with customers helps them out and <unk> everyone else how to work better 
 so it turns out this lady had been helped by susan a few months back while the lady had been using a walker due to back surgery 
 she 's walking fine now so she walks over and gives susan a huge hug and says wait here i 've got something for you in my car '' 
 when she comes back in she hands susan a single <unk> rose and says that 's for all you did for me back when i was n't so mobile and how you 're always pleasant and happy when i see you thank you for everything you do '' 
 at this point susan is crying and my faith in humanity is completely restored 
 i have n't seen that customer back since but if i ever do i 'll make sure she gets special treatment because she is one of the lucky few who realize that retail slaves are actually people and appreciates <unk> little story 
 today i had a teenager around 16 i 'm guessing come up to the front desk where i work 
 he seemed nice enough 
 he was asking about getting a job with us so i had him write down his info and told him to send in an application 
 not even five minutes later i see my manager running out the door yelling 
 turns out the kid who just asked about getting a job just got caught trying to steal some allergy medicine from us 
 so my manager walked him over to the nearest register and made him pay for it 
 aka the walk of shame 
 i saw this go down and could n't resist myself 
 i yelled out sorry i do n't think we 're hiring right now 
 necessary opening mentioning that i work in the meat department of a grocery store 
 customer referred to as butter lady or bl walks up to me as i exit the meat department in my uniform with the blood-covered plastic apron and asks & gt bl : hi do you have any more of the butter that 's on sale 
 & gt me : oh i do n't work in dairy but i 'll head to the back and see if someone else can help you 
 & gt bl : thanks 
 so i head to the back of the store which connects all the different departments if you wander enough and i find a pair of guys talking and when they notice me i just ask & gt me : i have a customer that 's looking for the butter that 's on sale 
 & gt dude : i fucking swear to god 
 there 's two signs out there that say we 're sold out of the fucking butter 
 tell her that we 're sold out 
 and to read the fucking sign 
 a very confused and slightly disgruntled me heads back out to talk to the lady and the conversation is as follows & gt me : hi i 'm really sorry but we 're sold out of that butter 
 my coworker said that they 're working on a sign to put there 
 & gt bl : yeah i know 
 i saw the sign i was just making sure 
 then she walks <unk> run a terrible little shop in a uk service station 
 most of the time it is very quiet <unk> me to spend time browsing reddit but occasionally we get people come in both to browse buy steal and occasionally like this couple because they were lost 
 it was an older couple and they were visibly shaken and both seemed on the edge of tears 
 they were late for a <unk> at a clinic had taken a wrong turn and did n't know where they were 
 so i helped as best i could 
 i found the phone number of their clinic lent them my phone so they could let them know what was happening told them where they were showed them their route and provided them with a map google maps printed showing them how to get home 
 i keep getting told my job satisfaction should lie in making big sales but i really do n't care 
 its the people like this that i can help that keeps me from going insane 
 tonight when i was cleaning in the supermarket 's deli i overheard this conversation between the deli worker and a customer : c = customer dw = deli worker & gt c : excuse me do you have any christmas hams 
 & gt dw : i 'm sorry we sold out this morning 
 it 's been busy 
 & gt c : what 
 i need that ham 
 & gt dw : they were very popular 
 & gt c : but it is impossible to run out of christmas hams on christmas eve 
 & gt dw : ... ... ... ... but we did run out <unk> & gt c : can you get some more in for me 
 & gt dw : there is a supply coming in on boxing day 
 & gt c : boxing day 
 i need it for tomorrow 
 is n't there some coming tomorrow 
 & gt dw : the store is closed tomor- & gt c : get me a ham right now 
 & gt dw : the store closes in 5 minutes 
 there is no ham 
 if you continue to yell at me i 'll have security escort you out of the store 
 & gt c : you ca n't do tha- ... .. <unk> priority 1 to <unk> '' & gt c : how dare you gee i did n't know our hams were that good ... **tl dr : customer wants ham needs it for christmas but we 're out 
 gets angry and security <unk> him from the store**so i work at a smaller department store where at the front registers we have chocolate and popcorn and a bunch of other things no one really needs 
 when the candy/snack is going to expire in 30 days we separate it and sign it 50 % off 
 because our pos does n't know it 's 50 % we have to input it in manually 
 usually not a problem until this guy that came to my register with his wife 
 man : this is supposed to be 50 % but it does n't say 50 % '' 
 me : yeah it is 50 % but i have to input the 50 % manually when i ring it up 
 do n't worry i 'll make sure you get the right price '' 
 trying to be as nice as possible wife : i 'm sorry he 's always so <unk> '' 
 man : no look it 's not 50 % 
 it should be 50 % but the price on the tag is still regular price it should only be <unk> '' 
 me : sir i have n't rung it up yet give me a second '' 
 i ring the item up 
 man : see it 's not 50 % i told you '' 
 me : sir i 'm a human being not a robot you have to give me a second to type it in '' 
 wife : you go girl 
 good job for saying that to him '' 
 i had no idea what to say at that moment so i just finished the transaction and wished them a happy easter 
 sorry if formatting is off i 'm at work on my phone hello <unk> 
 i work in a coffee shop in an international flying area so we meet some pretty interesting people 
 this story has been grinding my beans since it happened on sunday night 
 a quick relevant detail : my coffee shop is large circular shape so when i 'm making people 's orders especially if they 're blended i 've got to face away from the front counter to use the <unk> or <unk> or coffee grinder or coffee merch like tshirts or to grab teas and syrups 
 <unk> 
 picture it : <unk> pm on a sunday during the slow months 
 usually this means that the end of a <unk> is pretty empty 
 no one is flying in no one is flying out food employees are pretty much just standing around waiting until their <unk> closing time finally comes around <unk> p.m. 
 cue my cool boss man leaving an hour early 
 suddenly mass amounts of people decide all at once that the only <unk> shop in the building is the hip place to be 
 within a few minutes i had about 20 separate people in line 
 i embrace this kind of chaos though since i had been sitting around twiddling my thumbs for a good hour 
 i take a deep breath put on a sincere smile and began to <unk> through the long line of <unk> people needing their caffeine fix 
 the line was <unk> down a steady rate everyone is happy jokes are being told <unk> <unk> is thrown about and i 'm rushing around the coffee kiosk making smoothies milkshakes iced & amp hot espresso drinks etc with exceptional <unk> 
 tips were pouring in the nice crisp green ones 
 i counted at least $ 20 just in $ 1 bills 
 i learned later that there were three delayed flights all at the same time down at my end something that does n't happen that often 
 this means that sometimes 3 more flights will be delayed waiting for the first delay to leave 
 thus the rush of people 
 2.5 hours iater at closing time 
 i told my last customer to have a nice flight then i shut the lights off and rushed around the store pulling in product and closing off the opening where the lines could begin 
 i clocked out at 7 and dumped my tip jar on the counter to see how much extra dough i earned that day 
 right away i knew something was wrong 
 the dollar pile was <unk> 
 my suspicions were confirmed 
 $ 8 and some change 
 at some point in the breaks between crowds some jackass reached into my jar when i had my back turned and helped themselves to a handful of dollar bills 
 i sigh to myself 
 this is the 4th time this has happened since september 
 i consider making a <unk> with teeth to trap the next thief 
 ah <unk> i work in a big box home improvement retail chain in the us 
 on my phone blah blah blah 
 so i have a lot of stories i have been wanting to post 
 this one is more funny than rage <unk> 
 so the store i work at is open until 10pm except on sundays we close at 8pm 
 so last sunday i was closing 
 due to it being slow i got out at about <unk> i was outside waiting for my ride talking to the wife of one of my coworkers as she waited for him to be done 
 a man pulled up in his pickup and started yelling at me 
 why are you closed so early 
 that is illegal '' 
 me : we close at 8 on sundays 
 the hours are listed on the door as well as online '' 
 him : it is n't sunday you dumb bitch '' 
 me : i assure you it is '' 
 him : what 
 no 
 checks phone oh 
 well thank you me : you are very welcome '' 
 him : no 
 you are welcome 
 fuck you bitch '' 
 he then proceeded to speed around me in the parking lot doing donuts and tried to be intimidating 
 i just stood there smoking and waiting for him to leave 
 it was made better by the fact that my coworkers wife was sitting there with a look of terror on her face and was surprised that someone would talk to me like that 
 i told her every fucking day '' 
 so bio i work at a pretty <unk> end clothing store aimed at fashionable 20-30 year <unk> 
 most of the time my job basically consists of organizing <unk> and occasionally when we have a lot of employees on staff walking around as <unk> prevention 
 this one particular day last week to be <unk> i was making a round in the men 's side when i noticed this suspicious looking dude with a bag from another store by the novelty polos our <unk> items so i walk over ask the guy if he needs help and tells me nah bro just browsing '' and walks off without another word 
 ok ... red flag # 1. i then spot him picking up at least 6 novelty polos and taking them to the fits where he takes around 2 minutes and then walks out a relatively short time to try on 6 polos 
 red flag # 2. he decided to leave 4 polos at the fits folding table and then walks over to the registers i noticed he only had 1 polo in his hand 
 as i skim over the fits folding table i only find 4 the 5th one nowhere to be seen 
 i know exactly where it is 
 as soon as the guy pays out at the register for his single polo and walks through the door what do i hear but the blaring of the security alarm 
 for reference almost everything in our store has a security sensor on it 
 the second the alarm sounds i walk over and instinctively hands me the bag from our store 
 i check it <unk> knowing the real prize is somewhere else 
 i ask to check his bag from another store he hands it over and what do i find 
 the stolen polo security sensor in tow 
 i immediately bust it out to him 
 oh no need to worry 
 i 'm a secret shopper 
 i was testing the employees here to see if they were capable of spotting shoplifting 
 it seems your store passed because of you i 'll let the company know i 'll put in a call later on to store manager that you did a good job '' 
 at this point i ask him for the badge that secret shoppers from our company get to verify authenticity 
 in a heartbeat the motherfucker <unk> throwing the polo on the floor and runs out the door 
 you almost got me you sneaky bastard 
 lady calls 
 & gt i bought a turkey breast roast and i took it out to <unk> and it says cajun style '' on it 
 what does that mean 
 that means it 's cajun style 
 it is a spicy kind of <unk> 
 & gt so it 's spicy 
 yes 
 & gt why would you do this 
 ... do what 
 & gt why would you put this with the turkey breast roasts 
 there are 5 <unk> there 's cajun <unk> white meat white and dark meat <unk> & gt but i wanted a turkey breast roast 
 why did you put this with the turkey breast roasts 
 they 're <unk> turkey breast roasts 
 they are each in their own section 
 & gt there was nothing there advertising this 
 each package says right on it what it is and there 's a tag above or below every single item in the entire store including these roasts 
 & gt but there was nothing advertising this 
 i 'm not sure what you are trying to say 
 like i said each package says in big colored letters what style the roast is 
 they all have a barrier between them 
 & gt you are so stupid 
 i ca n't believe you did this 
 this is where i would normally hang up 
 first time a customer has said this to me 
 i did n't do anything 
 and i ca n't do anything 
 you are calling our department over the phone 
 we do not have a register for returns and we do not have the authority to authorize them 
 even if we did we ca n't do it over the phone 
 you need to go to the service desk 
 & gt i bought this three weeks ago 
 i do n't have the receipt 
 why would you do this 
 if you do n't have the receipt they still might let you exchange it but that is not up to me 
 they usually do n't let people exchange things for that reason 
 & gt i ca n't drive out there 
 the weather is terrible 
 i need this for today and my family does n't like spicy food 
 i ca n't do anything for you 
 you 'll have to go to the service desk 
 **tl dr woman buys spicy roast because she did n't pay attention <unk> me is upset because it burned her <unk> when she shoved it up her <unk> oh and the weather complaint is shortened she went on about the weather for 40 seconds easily- and she brought it back anyway 
 a little background here : in the 70 's and 80 's my grandad owned an equipment rental business and had my grandma and mom doing book keeping answering phones stuff like that 
 this is a story of what my mom overheard one day while at the counter 
 gd is grandad obc is oblivious customer 
 obc was there to rent a garden tiller and was shooting the breeze with gd 
 obc mentioned it was his first time starting a garden 
 obc : so what all can you plant in a garden 
 gd : oh shit anything really <unk> <unk> carrots <unk> <unk> macaroni ... obc : wait did you say macaroni 
 gd : yep obc : i thought macaroni was ... where do you even get the seeds 
 gd : ya just need to go to the grocery store and grab a bag of macaroni of the shelf 
 gd proceeded to <unk> obc on what brand of macaroni to get how far apart to plant them how deep how much sunlight they needed and how much water they needed 
 obc left with his newfound information and his rented tiller 
 when obc returned the following week he informed gd that he had followed exactly what he had been told to do and was looking forward to having his own macaroni plants 
 weeks pass and obc comes back into the rental shop for a lawn <unk> and mentions to gd that none of his macaroni had <unk> 
 gd says as straight faced as ever oh ya <unk> had a bad bag '' i never usually post here because i 'm not sure if my job counts as retail it 's usually more customer service 
 but today i was taking calls at my job and a woman calls to make a booking for a special type of food event we have 
 we have a set price per person she wants to book for 2 adults and a child i ask her what age the child is because the children 's menus only goes up to age 11 a bit <unk> i know but i do n't make the rules turns out the child is <unk> so i tell her that her child will have to pay the adult price she goes ballistic but he wo n't eat the adult meal just put him down for the child 's menu etc 
 i tell her i ca n't do it 
 so she changes her story and suddenly the child is 11. fine 
 be like that 
 i do n't care money does n't come out of my pocket 
 then it comes to making the booking because these events are <unk> popular we require payment at the time of booking 
 i explain this to her 
 ** '' no i 'll pay for it on friday 
 ** ** '' ok but i can not save the tickets for you until then the system only allows me to reserve the tickets when the payment is taken 
 ** ** '' well you have to put them aside for me until friday my mother has breast cancer 
 ** excuse me what 
 what has that got to do with it 
 ** '' i 'm sorry but this system does n't allow me to to do that 
 if you want to call on friday or do it on our website you 'll need to risk not getting the time you want 
 ** ** '' oh so this is how you welcome people to city name removed to protect the me 
 you ca n't even do this thing for me even though my mother has breast cancer 
 ** i explained to her i was very sorry but there is no way i could make the system do something it ca n't do and point out that if she paid today it was unlikely the money would leave the account before friday 
 but she 's having none of it and apparently is going to complain to my manager who i 'm very lucky is a really cool guy and wo n't punish me because he knows i 'm good at my job and do not lose my cool until after the customers are safely out of ear shot 
 but i am absolutely shaking with rage 
 what kind of person does that 
 what kind of person uses the fact <unk> own <unk> has cancer in order to try and get special treatment for themselves 
 it 's not even as if she was doing this a treat for her mother then perhaps i might have understood but no it 's for her her husband and her kid 
 i absolutely despair of some people 
 sorry if this is a tad muddled 
 i 'm still in rage mode 
 i used to work at an office supply store 
 the amount of shoplifting we got was insane 
 i 'm walking towards the back of my store restocking some shelves when a woman comes up to me holding a small address book 
 & gt hi i just wanted to check to see if the price for this was correct 
 i used the price scanner and it said $ 25 
 that ca n't be right 
 i know all of those little books are disproportionately expensive so i 'm pretty sure the price is correct 
 i check for her anyway 
 & gt yep it looks like its $ 25 
 sorry about that for some reason all of those address books are oddly expensive 
 & gt that 's ridiculous 
 i 'm just gon na steal it then 
 & gt ok. and i walked away 
 if she really wanted to steal it it 's our policy not to stop them which is probably why we have so much theft in the first place 
 i did n't stick around to see if she actually did take it or not but i 'm pretty positive she did 
 i 'm just glad i do n't have to deal with those customers anymore 
 edit : and sorry about the formatting on mobile so it 's a <unk> used to work in a large home improvement store as their garden specialist my duties were not limited to just <unk> with the flowers but also included driving forklift and unloading the plant delivery trucks 
 <unk> and july were the busiest months and sometimes we had 5 or 6 trucks a day to unload and process all the while customers were trying to <unk> stuff off the racks before i could check the inventory in 
 we worked in the side parking lot of our store and would set out safety cones to block off the work area running the forklift counting plants scanning them in etc 
 so i 'm unloading my 4th truck of the day space all blocked off when this 'lady pulls into the lot and proceeds to drive over 2 of my orange safety cones 
 i send one of my <unk> over to tell her that she ca n't park there for safety reasons and that we need the area for unloading trucks 
 'lady gets all huffy and says that she will park any place she wants and if i do n't like tough but she spends thousands of dollars in our store and she can park where ever she wants i hate that spiel it just pushes my button 
 my one co worker looks at me and then starts to shake her head she knows i 'm irked and that the 'lady may be sorry she opened her big <unk> 20 mins later 'lady comes back from her <unk> <unk> only to find her car surrounded by 20 racks of plants she had just enough room to squeeze into her drivers side door but could n't pull out of her spot we the employees had all conveniently vanished from the area and we watched from a spot back by all the mulch stacks 
 i then walked out near were she was and she wanted to know when we were going to move the racks from around her car and why did we put them there and it was n't right <unk> ... she was sputtering mad 
 i replied nicely oh in about 15 mins when my help came back from their break and that i had warned her not to park there because we needed the space for our unloading and that i could n't move them by myself because it was against policy to run equipment when customers were in the area and it would take two of us to do it by hand 
 needless to say i did n't see her again in our store..i was blowing up balloons for some promotion at my work and there was a little cutie <unk> 6 years old with her dad and little <unk> looking at me <unk> 
 she was soooo adorable so i walked over to her and asked if she wanted a balloon 
 she happily said yes and when i handed it over she proudly announced that she also knew how to blow up a balloon herself 
 i gave her an <unk> balloon saying : *me : * here you go 
 you can blow this balloon up for your little brother 
 *little girl : * that 's not my brother that 's my little sister 
 *me cringing : * oh ... i 'm really bad at ... kids faces 
 *little girl <unk> grin : * but that 's alright she looks like a boy anyway 
 <unk> : * yeah we get that a lot ... man this is why i <unk> at talking to kids 
 edit : i should add that the dad was super chill about it and thanked me for the balloons 
 top dude 
 it did n't stop my coworkers from laughing at me though i 'm not sure this deserves an update but after posting people can be vicious 
 cried at work for the first time about three months ago i got a lot of pms 
 not regarding <unk> or other customers but regarding my manager 
 these past few weeks have been absolutely insane 
 since this incident our staff began to have more and more problems with this manager <unk> us embarrassing us and just making our lives miserable 
 we came close to having a lot of great people quit and we went home every night absolutely hating our jobs 
 things got really bad for a while 
 finally i decided enough was enough and i gathered everyone that had talked to me about their issues with him and decided to take it to our store manager and have one big meeting 
 this decision terrified me 
 i have n't been there nearly as long as some of the others and i 'm low on the food chain 
 my decision could have gotten me in serious trouble or even terminated 
 i figured if i was going to get fired for speaking up about the harassment we were <unk> then i did n't want to work there anyways 
 the meeting lasted about an hour or so and we did n't even get everything out that we had wanted to say 
 it was time to go back to work 
 we were told things would get sorted out 
 the next day i come in to this weird <unk> 
 everyone was in a good mood customers were happy and i did n't see the grumpy miserable faces i usually saw when i got to work 
 my manager no longer worked for the company 
 this was enough to celebrate but what would come next was even better 
 we all began to wonder who would take his job 
 we all got along with each other so it was fair game 
 they talked for a while about hiring someone brand new and that made us a bit nervous 
 it could be someone just as bad or worse than the original manager 
 there 's a lot of meetings and closed doors and finally i get called in 
 long story short i got the job 
 i 'm young and have no experience with management and i got the job 
 i 'm beyond proud of myself and i 'm excited to see what i can do for our store 
 things are turning up 
 **tl dr action was finally taken against my manager and i was offered his job 
 ** edit : thank you to <unk> for reddit gold 
 you 're awesome : i work at a gas station and for the last few months we 've had a promotion with a department store and if you spend so much money at that store you get a coupon for a discount on gas at my store 
 sounds kinda confusing typing that out but the main idea is lots of people have coupons to save money on gas around here 
 anyway one day a lady comes in with said coupon however this coupon looked like it went through hell 
 looked like it sat in the sun for a while <unk> it of it 's color some weird looking dirt smudged around it and on top of that it was <unk> 
 i <unk> just thinking about it 
 however none of those are reasons why i did n't accept it 
 i could n't accept her coupon because there was no bar code 
 i tried to politely tell her that unfortunately without the bar code i would n't be able to take her coupon and she started grinning and <unk> said actually you are legally required to take my coupon 
 i know these games you guys play here and if you try and play me i 'll call the cops on you '' 
 now ladies and gentlemen i 'm not very familiar with coupon law but i do know my company 's policy and knew for a fact that this coupon was void without the bar code 
 we are n't allowed to discount gas manually 
 at this point as i 'm sure you all expected she was asking for a manager 
 i called my manager over to deal with this and he said the same thing to her as i did 
 at this point she was smiling ear to ear like she found pleasure in confrontations like this 
 she again said we legally had to take it and my manager was starting to get fed up with her 
 he told her again there 's absolutely no way we can use her coupon for all we knew it had already been used 
 well the lady was n't backing down and began loudly exclaiming how she was going to call our corporate office and file a complaint on all of us 
 during her speech about how terrible we all were my manager began laughing 
 he told the lady to look at the coupon i took a <unk> myself to see what he thought was so funny 
 turns out the coupon expired a week ago so even if it had the bar code we still could n't take it 
 she stared at it for a second and started muttering well it 's ... ..you still ... .. '' then she left 
 she just walked out without saying another word 
 just another day.so for a short time i use to work at this little gas station out in the middle of no-where 
 one day i 'm standing at the cash register and this older cracked out lady comes into a store with an empty fountain cup in her hand 
 i think nothing of it because we sell refills 
 i watch her go over to the soda fountain and put the cup back with the other cups and then continue looking around the store 
 i 'm a bit confused so i ask her about it 
 the following conversation then takes place 
 customer : that was my old cup 
 i washed it its clean 
 someone else can use it '' me : you mean you drank out of it '' 
 customer : yes but i washed it '' me : you 're suppose to throw them away when you 're done '' customer : why 
 its still a perfectly good cup 
 i 'm not going to waste that cup 
 why would i throw away a cup that someone else can use 
 i do n't like being wasteful like that '' 
 me : but you drank out of it 
 your mouth was on it 
 that 's disgusting '' customer : are you calling me disgusting now 
 i always wash my cups and return them here 
 you should be thanking me i save you guys a lot of cups '' 
 finally she starts to leave the store while still going on this rant about the environment and how wasteful our store is 
 as soon as she is gone i go throw all the cups away 
 and that 's why i never buy fountain drinks <unk> i had just turned 18 i was working as a cashier at a now <unk> grocery chain 
 the money and hours sucked but i was at that point in life where i needed to make some money while deciding what the hell to do with my life 
 our store had an employee policy that basically stated that if you went on break and bought something to eat there you could ring yourself up for it after you were off break 
 essentially if you grabbed some hot wings and a soda you did n't have to pay until you came back 
 simple 
 my period was late i was <unk> etc 
 all day at work i was sweaty and nervous hoping to god i was n't pregnant there had been a condom <unk> i was n't simply irresponsible 
 my break came and i worked up the nerve 
 i knew we had pregnancy tests on sale and i went and grabbed one 
 while in the aisle i noticed our lp guy doing his rounds and thought nothing of it 
 i took my test to the bathroom with the intent of <unk> ringing it up as soon as i was off break and getting rid of the box 
 it was only $ 5 and due to a lucky scratch off ticket from the day before i had $ 70 in my purse relevant 
 i follow the instructions and boom i 'm <unk> 
 i was in disbelief panicked and sweating profusely 
 my head was spinning 
 i put the box in the pocket of my apron pull myself together for the last few hours of my shift and begin trying to figure out how i was going to tell my mother 
 as i 'm walking down one of the aisles towards the registers the lp guy swept up behind me grabbed the back of my arm quite <unk> and without a word dragged me to the back offices 
 i kept asking what the hell was going on but he would n't speak 
 he placed me in his office left and locked the door 
 what the fuck was going on 
 a few minutes later he returned with the manager and my piss soaked stick test in his gloved hand 
 he began to accuse me of stealing 
 i quickly retorted that he had grabbed me on my way to my register and just like everything else an employee grabs when on break i was going to pay for it once i was back on my register 
 my manager seemed confused and unsure of the lp guys <unk> and asked if i actually had the money to pay for it 
 my purse was in a hidden <unk> under the register and he went and got it for me while lp guy takes it upon himself to call the cops 
 my manager returned and i proceeded to show him that i had more then enough money to pay for the item 
 lp guy shoots back that i would n't of tried to hide '' the box in my apron if that 's what i was going to do 
 i angrily explained that i did n't need the whole store knowing my business and i was going to be <unk> 
 he was n't going for it 
 in a store frequented by wealthy elderly people shoplifting was n't an issue and i believe in his mind he was finally getting the chance to bust '' someone 
 i demanded to call my mother 
 no it was n't because i needed my mommy it was because i wanted a ride home 
 you 're 18 sweetheart 
 no <unk> here '' 
 and he ripped the phone from my hand 
 up until this point i had raised my voice but had <unk> from cussing name calling etc 
 i had just found out i was pregnant and within minutes of trying to <unk> that in i had a man who had obviously failed the training to be a cop accusing me of trying to steal a $ 5 pregnancy test 
 i was emotional '' and i do n't think anyone could blame me 
 he slammed a piece of paper in front of me and began to demand i sign it 
 it was a statement saying i admit to stealing 
 i refused and attempted to leave 
 he blocked the door and told me i was n't going anywhere and physically seated me again 
 he kept screaming and pointing at the paper and i was praying that the cops would just show up 
 he tells me i ca n't leave the office until i sign it and left the room locking the door behind him 
 it was a big door and there was no way i could force it down 
 i took the opportunity to call my mom and simply got the words come quick '' out of my mouth before he stormed back in and removed the phone from the room altogether 
 at that moment i tried to <unk> him to get out of the office to find he had manned the hallway with some of the stock guys and i was physically pushed back into the room and locked in once again 
 i was in complete panic mode 
 after what seemed like a <unk> i just signed the paper and as i was sliding it under the door as proof i heard the sounds of police radios 
 finally 
 lp guy opens the door an enters with 2 officers 
 he had obviously already gone thru his version of things and now they wanted to hear from me 
 i went thru the whole thing and the stock guys confirmed that paying for things <unk> was common 
 i showed them my money etc 
 they could tell i was flustered and one noted the pee stick in the table and saw that it was positive 
 they talked amongst themselves for a few minutes before i heard my mother at the customer service desk demanding to know where i was she do n't play 
 the officers close the door so it 's just me lp guy and them 
 did she attempt to leave the store without paying '' 
 one asked no 
 i caught her in the aisle '' 
 lp responded so she was n't near an exit running 
 anything like that '' 
 one of them asked 
 no 
 caught the sneaky bitch before she could leave '' 
 to me we 're you clicked back in '' 
 yes 
 i was headed to my register to pay like everyone does '' 
 lying bitch '' lp shot back 
 meanwhile i could hear the manger trying to keep my mom from ripping his throat out yes my mother is that tough i was gon na leave 
 i do n't have a car 
 i do n't even drive you fucking moron '' 
 the officers turned to lp guy who was gripping my signed statement ok. from what we 've gathered she was in the clock and following your stores policy 
 she did n't try to leave so no shoplifting or attempted shoplifting occurred '' 
 lp began to argue only to be met by a quick and authoritative hand in his face sir you moved this girl against her will about 400 feet 
 another hundred and we 'd be arresting you for <unk> 
 you locked her in this office 
 that 's <unk> he may have used a different term ca n't recall and the fire marshall would have your head '' 
 lp shoved the paper at them 
 she admitted it '' 
 the officer grinned that was signed under <unk> and my partner and i will testify to that if need be 
 if you lock someone in a room long enough you can force them to admit to just about anything '' 
 second cop miss this seems like a real shitty case of jumping the gun 
 do you want to press charges '' 
 her 
 for what '' 
 lp guy freaked 
 i just told you 
 you 'd be better at your job if you watched and listened '' 
 i told them no '' 
 not only did i have to tell my panicked mom i was pregnant but i had to explain this too 
 i did n't want to get wrapped up in any of that 
 i just wanted to go home and cry 
 i put the $ 5 on the desk table and one of the officers escorted me to the customer service desk and assured my mother i was n't in trouble in fact i was a victim 
 my manager was clueless as to what had just happened and the officers merely told him she could have brought major trouble for this place 
 i would n't fire her if i were you '' 
 before he could answer i merely said fuck this job '' 
 and left with my mother 
 a year later the chain went <unk> and a few months after that i saw lp guy pumping ppl 's gas in nj 
 if you 're out their lp guy fuck you 
 **edit** first of all thank you for all your kind words 
 i never expected one of the worst days of my life would touch so many people 
 looking back yes i should have pressed charges 
 in that moment tho i just wanted out 
 i 'd never had any <unk> with the law before this and had no idea what pro <unk> '' meant etc 
 my whole life had changed in that bathroom and my head was swimming and i felt like i was trying to breathe underwater 
 if something like this happened now i would be all over it with an army of lawyers but at the time i was still a kid 
 i have no idea if they fired lp guy over this 
 i only went back 2 weeks later to collect my final paycheck 
 i could of had it mailed but i wanted to walk in with my head held high and that 's just what i did 
 a small way of taking back my own sense of security 
 i hope no one ever has to go thru what i went thru that day and i also hope that if anyone 's rights are violated they are <unk> then i and do press charges 
 that is something i regret immensely about the situation but in my eyes at the time an 18 year old vs an army of corporate hired lawyers did n't make for good odds 
 i work at a national chain craft store 
 my coworkers always joke about how <unk> and deadpan i can get when people are yelling at me 
 there 's this huge fad out right now with this rubber band <unk> loom 
 we carry them and right now they 're on sale and so are the individual packages of refill rubber <unk> 
 the display they 're set up on is right in front of the door when you walk into the store with the registers being immediately to the right of the door 
 now the store *always* has some sort of coupon out 
 usually it 's a 40 % off one regular priced item 
 if something is on sale already the coupon does n't work on it 
 so yesterday this ornery looking lady comes to my register with a loom about 15 packages of rubber band refills and a handful of <unk> from the clearance bins 
 there are one or two other small things that are regular price 
 she presents the 40 % off coupon and another 20 % off the whole order 
 i scan all of her items and put them in the bag while she <unk> the screen on her side 
 when i get to the coupons they only take a tiny amount off 
 when i tell her the total this happens : ornery lady : why did n't you use my coupons 
 that 's way too much 
 i ca n't afford that 
 me : i did but they do n't work on things that are already on sale 
 it took the 40 and 20 off of your <unk> items 
 they were pretty cheap already so it only took a few cents off 
 ol : that 's bullshit 
 this is totally illegal 
 it 's false advertising 
 it does n't say anywhere that i ca n't use coupons for sale items 
 give me my damn discount 
 i need these 
 me : i 'm sorry but it does say right here on the coupon that sale items are excluded and on a very large sign on the loom display itself that no additional coupons or discounts can be used on the loom stuff 
 and all of this other stuff is already on clearance 
 ol : shouting now what sign 
 there 's no sign 
 this is bullshit 
 you 're trying to steal my money 
 i calmly walk five feet over to the display and pick up the bright yellow sign that says no additional discounts may be applied to loom products '' and hold it up to show her 
 she visibly puffs up and <unk> you little bitch 
 i will never shop here again 
 i spend a lot of money here 
 you just lost a very important customer '' 
 she storms out and my manager runs up to me 
 she exclaims what on earth just happened 
 are you okay '' 
 yeah that lady was just mad because she ca n't read 
 so as many of you are probably aware most debit cards can be processed as credit cards 
 a lot of customers for whatever reason actually prefer that their cards be processed as credit 
 enter rude lady who does n't seem to know much about the whole process : & gt she hands me her card & gt me : thank you is debit ok or would you prefer me to run it as credit 
 & gt rl : well it 's a debit card is n't it 
 you have n't been doing this very long have you 
 & gt me cue retail voice : i 'm so sorry i should have known 
 if you could just enter your pin ... & gt rl : i never enter my pin 
 it 's not secure to enter your pin 
 is n't there a way you can run it so i do n't have to 
 & gt me : ... so you 'd like me to run it as credit 
 she shut right the fuck up 
 yes i asked for her <unk> work as a fast food cashier usually the opening shift 
 yesterday a man comes through and orders $ 20 worth of breakfast then pulls up to the window and gives me the <unk> 
 & gt me : hi your total is $ <unk> 
 & gt him : politely enough do y'all offer a military discount 
 & gt me : unfortunately we do not 
 & gt him : angrily well why the f**k not 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry sir i have no idea 
 i 'm just a cashier 
 & gt him : well you should start offering one 
 and drives off 
 i totally understand asking about military discounts 
 my so is a <unk> and i encourage him to ask at a lot of places because the worst that happens is they 'll say no 
 but why get angry over the $ 2 this guy would have saved 
 and why would the cashier have anything to do with it 
 some people are just <unk> tfr 
 i work as a cashier at a high end grocery store 
 our store is pretty cool actually in that we have a bar inside 
 the bar is situated towards the back of the store right next to our meat department and in front of our restrooms 
 it 's quite large and hard to miss or at least i thought so until this lady 
 i was <unk> at my register like a good little cashier when a lady comes up to me and this conversation happens : lady : hello where are the restrooms 
 me : they 're located directly behind the bar 
 *pointing down the aisle where you can see the wall of the <unk> lady : *deer in headlights look* wait you have a bar in here 
 me : yes ma'am towards the back of the store *points again* and directly behind it is our restrooms 
 lady : oh 
 you must 've just installed it 
 me : the bar 
 no ma'am it was built along with the building and opened with us back in september 
 lady : <unk> her head at me in disbelief and then starts walking <unk> no no no i 've never seen it 
 i was just here last week 
 you must 've just gotten it 
 i just found it humorous that she had to convince herself that we had just installed it to make herself feel better 
 hey there here 's a short one for you all 
 yesterday was pretty busy for a sunday and the phone was ringing off the hook 
 the horrible christmas music that plays over the intercom was frequently interrupted by calls for various departments to pick up <unk> line 
 so there i am putting stuff back on the shelves when i hear the following : mod please take the call on line one '' 
 produce please take the call on line three '' 
 tires please take the call on line four '' 
 roger roger 
 over <unk> 
 what 's your <unk> <unk> '' 
 the customers around me just started giggling while their kids did n't have any clue why 
 sometimes retail is <unk> was working the cash register today as always because the <unk> and management are in on the same sick and twisted joke when a woman came up to my counter to check out 
 i thought it would go smoothly despite her ignoring my greeting and rolling her eyes when i asked as cheerfully as possible if there was anything else i could help her with 
 look lady i get that you think i 'm a robot but we all got ta do what we got ta do 
 she does n't say a word to me and starts pulling her wallet out of her purse 
 then her phone rings 
 and rings 
 and rings 
 it 's a nice little ringtone and i think maybe she is just going to let it go to voicemail since she is paying 
 nope 
 she stops everything to make a big fuss about pulling out her phone and answering the call 
 from the conversation i can tell that she is a very important real estate agent and she is about ready to close a <unk> deal 
 or whatever 
 as she is on the phone she decides she wants to enter her phone number into the <unk> in order to use her store <unk> account 
 cool 
 she can do that 
 but she keeps hitting cancel '' instead of look up number '' 
 she 'll hit the red x '' button instead of the green enter '' button 
 time and time again she does this still on the phone with her client 
 my line is building 
 this is n't working it 's not taking my number '' she says and keeps trying 
 i try to say just hit enter '' but she interrupts me by holding up her index finger to tell whoever is on the other line that the cashier does n't know what they 're doing 
 she tries to <unk> her phone number maybe three more times 
 every time she hits the wrong button and she starts over 
 i am visually <unk> when she <unk> over the correct button to complete the process and decides on the wrong button again 
 the regular in line behind her is chuckling 
 yeah just forget it '' she says and just goes to swipe her credit card 
 okaaaaaay <unk> 
 she finally hangs up with the person on her phone and her payment goes through 
 she looks up at me and says you need more training '' 
 fuck you very much lady 
 i work in a big retail chain 
 near the front we have a little value '' section with items that are 1 3 or 5 dollars 
 changes <unk> it 's a fun little place to find cheap crap and occasionally a surprisingly good value 
 one of the items that we always have over there are these file folders 
 they 're plastic different colors very useful things 
 they come in 2 sizes -- the smaller is roughly the size of a clutch purse the larger one is like a folder size 
 they 're both a dollar which i found interesting 
 i assumed it was $ 1 for the smaller and $ 3 for the larger 
 a woman came through my register with a ton of clearance items all the cliche coupon deals etc 
 i turned off my light because i could tell there was going to be a lot to explain and argue over during this transaction i see her a lot 
 i was right there was a lot of back and forth over how if a sale says buy 2 get one free '' you actually have to *buy 3 total items* you ca n't just have me void 2 of them and get a free thing 
 and i know she is fully aware of this crap just tries to get away with stuff and confuse cashiers 
 anyway i digress 
 my favorite part of the conversation is as follows : i ring up several of the aforementioned folders 
 she had maybe 5 of each size 
 & gt woman : wait the small one is a dollar too '' 
 & gt me : yes 
 they 're both a dollar 
 cool right 
 i always thought the big one was 3 '' 
 & gt woman : i 'm not paying that 
 i thought the small one would be like 50 cents '' 
 & gt me : no everything over there is 1 3 or 5 '' 
 & gt woman : well i 'm not paying that '' 
 & gt me : ok so do you not want just the small ones 
 or do you not want either size '' 
 & gt woman : no i still want them '' 
 & gt me : alright '' 
 <unk> scanning her other items 
 * & gt woman : no 
 i 'm not paying a dollar for those little ones '' 
 & gt me : well ... that 's the price 
 so if you want them they 're a dollar 
 we really do n't have sales on that section 
 if something is out of season like easter or christmas stuff it can be on clearance but we do n't have that going on right now '' 
 i 'm trying my best to explain to her why this is absolutely a dollar no questions about it 
 & gt woman : i. am 
 not 
 paying 
 that '' 
 & gt me : ok then you do n't want the small ones '' 
 i then void out the smaller folders and just move on 
 i 'm not going to be intimidated '' by her because i think that 's what she 's going for 
 thankfully i think she realized that i 'm not giving in and she just did n't talk for the rest of the <unk> back i used to visit my friend who worked at a now closed electronics chain for lunch and would occasionally hang out after for a while 
 my pal was closing down his station at the help desk so we could leave for lunch as he was doing that i noticed a man walk in 
 something caught his attention the rather large display for the 10 % off <unk> dvd speaker system sets 
 needless to say these boxes were fucking gigantic which is probably why the company was fine with putting them right next to the door 
 the man quickly looked around and either missed me staring at him or assumed i would n't care because he did n't hesitate at all 
 he bent down to grab the box and picked up in a way that looked as if it were designed to slip a disk 
 however there was only ten feet between him and the door he was practically home free all he had to do was leave 
 he must have made it two steps into his <unk> before he dropped the box and fell over it 
 it really was n't that hard of a fall in retrospect he was barely moving and the box was so large that he did n't trip over it as much as fall <unk> it 
 with that in mind he still hit the tile floor face first 
 i gasped and my friend looked over horrified before shouting out sir are you okay '' 
 the man shot up to his feet he touched his hand to his forehead which was bright pink as if he had been <unk> and then to his nose which was starting to drip little <unk> of blood 
 he darted quickly out of the door and into the parking lot never to be seen again.this is actually my dad 's story but it 's his favorite from all his years of working retail which is 35+ years 
 so he 's working one day and he gets a phone call from customer c 
 customer clearly sounds like an older man and he has a really thick accent 
 my dad employee or e puts something aside that customer will come in to pick up within the hour 
 it 's about two hours later and my dad gets a phone call from customer 
 & gt e : thanks for calling retail store 
 how may i help you 
 & gt c : hello 
 is this mr. employee 
 this is mr. customer from before 
 & gt e : yes hello mr. customer 
 i have your item set aside 
 i thought you were going to be coming in 
 & gt c : i 'm here but everybody is gone 
 & gt e : what do you mean nobody else is here 
 i 'm standing right at the front door we 're actually quite busy today 
 there 's a bunch of people here 
 & gt c : i knock on the door yelling mr. employee mr. employee please let me in '' 
 but nobody answer 
 i 've been doing this for almost an hour but nobody let me in 
 & gt e : okay mr. customer i 'm looking out into the parking lot and i do n't see anyone 
 where are you now 
 & gt c : i 'm at the pay phone 
 i 'm looking right at the front door 
 at this point my dad realizes something is n't right because the only pay phone in the area was around the back of the shopping center 
 it would be impossible for him to be at the phone and looking at the front doors 
 so my dad asks him to describe what he sees and my dad immediately catches on 
 the store that my dad works at has two locations and one is closed on sundays because of blue laws '' which were <unk> to <unk> traffic on sundays 
 it happened to be a sunday and customer was at that closed store instead 
 my dad felt so bad but could n't stop laughing at the thought of his old man pounding on the doors for over an hour of a store that was clearly empty even though my dad kept insisting to him that they were open 
 luckily the stores are n't really far away so customer was able to drive to the one that was open to pick up what he needed 
 based on his voice my dad picked him out as soon as he walked into the store 
 he saw him and yelled mr 
 customer '' 
 and customer yelled mr 
 employee '' 
 it was as if they were <unk> best <unk> this is n't my story but a coworker told me about this customer he had today 
 coworker - co. paranoid customer - pc 
 okay so co was standing at his register at the grocery store 
 kind of a slow day at least at that moment 
 he 's got his hands in his pockets as kids sometimes do 
 pc approaches and asks if he has a cell phone in his pocket 
 co yes '' 
 pc are you touching the cell phone '' 
 co yes '' 
 pc well i 'll have you know that the government has installed devices in cell phones to hurt other people just by touching the phone and you 're making my feet hurt by touching your phone '' 
 co silence '' 
 pc walks off 
 she apparently came by later and complimented co on not having his hands in his pockets and how her feet felt much better 
 howdy tfr i work in a mobile phone shop in the uk and had a gem of a customer so thought i would share 
 i was running through the computer part of a gentleman 's phone contract when i noticed the pricing of his phone was incorrect 
 turns out i had selected the wrong <unk> for him and had charged him an extra £5 pm 
 no bother i thought i shall go back and fix it 
 wrong no can do im afraid so i call the manager over for help 
 are you stupid pick the right one in future inconvenience this man and myself '' so hero gentleman pipes up 
 think you need to calm down pal 
 was a simple mistake that will take what 5-10 minutes to fix 
 yeh thought so so please allow <unk> to fix his mistake and show some <unk> '' 
 yes thank you random sir you are the man 
 faith in customers restored : sorry for formatting on mobile : a woman brought a dead electronic item to our return counter and insisted that she bought it from us along with an extended warranty but she had no receipt 
 a half hour of searching our database for the transaction turned up nothing under her name 
 the woman left briefly and i asked the cashier 'could she have bought it under another name or a company name 
 the cashier said 'i already asked and she said no 
 after another 15 minutes of <unk> looking *i* asked the woman if she could have given another name during the purchase 
 'no she barked glaring at me 
 the cashier finally found the transaction in our database by searching for the woman 's email address 
 the transaction listed the woman 's correct email address her street address and her phone number ... and an entirely different name 
 oh that 's just another name i use ... sometimes '' she said avoiding eye <unk> tales from retail 
 so i was not directly involved in this but i wanted to share it because i thought it might give some hope 
 today i was shopping at a local store and there was a mother and her child 
 the store is n't some big chain <unk> owned and all that 
 the child was being a brat he was screaming knocking stuff around total <unk> child from hell routine 
 up walks an underpaid staffer & gt ***ups : *** ma'am i have to ask you to please calm your child they are bothering the other customers 
 ***badmom : *** <unk> 
 * i do n't remember the kids name cut that shit out 
 to ups happy 
 the kid stopped the worker smiled and said yes and returned to what she was doing 
 a few minutes later and the kid is back at it louder angrier worse 
 again ups walks over and smiles nicely 
 & gt ***ups : *** ma'am please he is really causing a <unk> 
 ***bm : *** piss off 
 i tried 
 ***ups : *** if you ca n't control your child then you will have to leave ma'am please understand 
 of course this is likely the store policy but hell if she wanted to hear that 
 badmom starts with her <unk> i did nothing wrong 
 i want to see your supervisor '' 
 raging 
 through the back doors walks an older gentleman maybe 65 or at least stressed to that point he politely asks what is going on and the mother <unk> her voice only some tells him how this little <unk> of an employee '' demanded she leave because of her child 
 he lets ups explain her side then asks a passing customer if the child has indeed been screaming and making trouble 
 quite a few heads nod 
 he then turns and asks badmom to leave and take her child with her 
 she freaks out demanding the owner screams all kinds of profanity 
 then this exchange happens 
 & gt <unk> : *** dear lady i am the owner of this fine establishment 
 as ups explained your child has been causing a <unk> and bothering our other patrons 
 please take your child and leave i will watch your basket and you can return for your purchase later 
 ***bm : *** you can go to hell 
 my son was fine 
 you need to treat your customers with more respect 
 i am telling everyone i know about how you and your employees hate children 
 <unk> : *** we do n't hate children just yours 
 please leave before i call the police if i catch you here again it 's trespassing and i will press charges 
 she huffed and puffed and stomped out knocking over a newspaper stand on her way 
 he then apologized to every customer and asked ups if she was okay or if she needed a break 
 so hey there are good managers and owners and sometimes the bad people get told off 
 remember there is light somewhere in the <unk> 
 so a couple weeks ago i was working a solo evening shift at a sandwich shop in a local gas station 
 its about 5pm and its been dead quiet all day so im just <unk> cleaning and watching for a rare potential customer 
 a guy comes in and seemed like a really typical gas station customer kinda guy 
 early <unk> short big tattoos iron maiden t-shirt the works 
 he comes up and i take the first part of his order 
 i ask him how his day is going just to ease the silence while i 'm working on his food 
 he says its goin good and i put his sandwich in the oven 
 as i turn away from the oven and back to him he says actually its goin damn great '' 
 yeah '' 
 im at least a little interested at this point he did n't seem like a talkative man 
 yeah man i met a girl a couple of days ago and <unk> really hit it off 
 were all <unk> and shit and she seems to like hanging out all the time '' 
 as hes saying this he is slowly turning from <unk> to a weirdly <unk> smile 
 he starts telling me about her hair and how she laughs all in a really surprisingly innocent way 
 i wrap up his food and start the register when he leans towards me with his hands out 
 the best part is she has some just massive boobs '' and holds his hands apart in front of him to demonstrate 
 at that point he looks at me and realizes hes telling the sandwich guy about his love life over a sandwich for the last five minutes 
 we both start laughing and i hand him his sandwich and tell him im happy for him 
 he looks at me and apologizes saying sorry man i just feel awesome and i had to tell someone '' 
 made my day 
 sorry for any formatting problems i 'm on mobile 
 so i worked in the <unk> department of a pretty <unk> bridal store 
 it was generally quiet business was slow and thus only myself and my manager we 'll call her m were working this particular day 
 around an hour before closing time me and m were <unk> shirts and putting them out general stuff when an older lady ol walks in with a large box 
 me : spotting the large box good afternoon are you here to make a return '' 
 ol : smirking no i 'm not '' 
 me : okay well is there any way i can help you today '' 
 ol : still smirking no but i think i can help you '' 
 ok. at this point i 'm confused i look at m who kind of shrugs her shoulders and walks over to us neither of us knowing where this is going 
 m : hello what brings you here today '' 
 the lady puts the box on the floor and stands triumphantly with her arms crossed 
 ol : i have something here i think you 'll be very interested in '' 
 before either of us can say anything she whips the lid off the box and then resumes her previous position still with that grin plastered on her face 
 inside the box is an electric blue <unk> hat 
 m <unk> a laugh and takes a step back leaving me to deal with this woman 
 me : ma'am we do n't sell those kind of hats here '' 
 ol : yes well i bought this hat for my son 's prom 15 years ago and when i did the owner of this shop said he loved it and if i ever wanted to sell it he would pay me a hefty sum '' 
 at this point i 'm trying not to laugh 
 she 's still standing there grinning like she 's pulled the greatest trump card the world has ever seen and the hat was in probably the worst condition it could possibly be in and packed inside a comically oversized box 
 our store only opened 3 years ago 
 there was no way it was our wealthy boss she spoke to and i do n't think anyone would pay a 'hefty sum for this - let alone him 
 me : i 'm sorry ma'am but you must have us confused with another store and besides we 're a shop 
 we sell and rent items we do n't buy '' 
 ol : getting agitated no no no 
 it was this shop 
 the owner said he would pay me for it and it would be an honour to sell it in his shop '' 
 me : trying hard to keep my composure i 'm sorry to tell you ma'am but you 're mistaken 
 we do n't sell these kinds of hats '' 
 ol : but you will sell this hat 
 the owner wants it 
 you 'll be in trouble with the owner '' 
 at this point m walks back over to us to intervene 
 m : madam you have the wrong person 
 we do not buy <unk> items unless an order has been specifically placed for them '' 
 ol : shrill the owner wants me to sell this hat 
 people want this hat 
 why wo n't you buy it '' 
 me : ma'am please if you look behind you you 'll see the only hats we sell are top hats and even those are n't popular 
 we have little demand for hats let alone one as unique as yours '' 
 ol : seems to get the picture huffs and <unk> packs away the hat picking up the box and glaring at me you 'll regret this '' 
 me : i 'm sure i will '' 
 the woman stares for a second before heading towards the door muttering to herself 
 just before she reaches it she turns around and <unk> up to us : ol : you will regret this '' 
 <unk> <unk> me : nodding okay have a nice day '' 
 before she could respond however my manager cuts in : m : there 's a charity shop down the road if you 'd like to try there '' 
 she left 
 i have n't worked retail in a while but i recently started at a beauty supply store 
 most customers have been really cool ... until yesterday 
 i 'm new so i 'm still learning all the ins and outs of the massive amount of beauty supplies we sell 
 this girl walks in an hands me a list 
 i 'll call her beauty school dropout or bsd 
 the list is for supplies for a beauty class she 's taking 
 ok this will probably be easy 
 i can gather things from a list right 
 maybe not 
 nothing is labeled it just lists things like curlers '' well we have a lot of curlers which kind do she need 
 of course she does n't know 
 but does she listen to my pitch for each item and make an informed decision 
 no 
 just sighs that i do n't now which exact <unk> her teacher wanted 
 then there is a type of <unk> pin listed but i did n't recognize the name 
 me : do you know what it looks like 
 bsd : i do n't know the name of it in english 
 me : well maybe you could take a look at the selection and see if you recognize it 
 bsd : but i do n't know the name of it in english 
 me : ... ok ... well maybe you could google the name you do know on your phone and show me a picture 
 bsd : but i do n't know the name of it in english 
 me : ... another woman asks for my help when i 'm free no rush though 
 surprisingly bsd kindly offers that i help the other lady first 
 so i go over and start to help her find a new curling iron 
 bsd stands behind us the whole time tapping her foot looking impatient and sighing 
 the curling iron lady felt so bad she just bought the first one i handed to her to get out of bsd 's way 
 as soon as i turn back to help bsd she asks : is there anyone else here who might know what they 're talking about who can help me '' 
 i gladly pass her off to my manager 
 i come back later as she 's checking out 
 apparently she 's taken multiple brushes we have from behind the counter that cost $ 150 by the way and examined them and tried to use them in her hair which we had to practically jump her to stop her from doing 
 then she drops the bomb : bsd : i do n't know why they let any of you work here you 're clearly not very good stylists 
 then strolls out 
 we all just laughed because shockingly we are n't all trained stylists who choose to work minimum wage retail positions just for fun 
 i have recently lost a chunk of weight about 20 % of my starting weight i have changed my body shape quite dramatically as you can imagine 
 my gym partner is a very well <unk> <unk> female who <unk> 
 she also loves <unk> just so you understand 
 i gym i <unk> race i still carry a bit of weight 
 she grew up in italy and has a competent grasp on the italian language where i know as much as mario and luigi and occasional <unk> sauce advertisement 
 i am heading out to dinner this weekend with friends so i task my gym buddy to aid me choosing a new outfit 
 not only am i a male i am an engineer 
 clothes for me are functional i am in desperate need of a queer eye or someone who understands fashion hence the <unk> of said female friend 
 we are in the local jeans shop i am squeezing into jeans not only in cuts that i never thought were possible but sizes which i never would have thought i would wear since primary school 
 as i am trying on a pair of jeans i hear two guys in the changerooms just up from me spark up a conversation 
 the most i can gather is they want to speak only in italian not in english 
 after that i lose track of what they are saying 
 at the moment i walk out of the changerooms for an opinion my friend turns to them says something vicious and <unk> in italian 
 these two guys turn bright red turn put down their potential purchases and slowly start backing out of the changerooms and shops entirely 
 after watching this whole <unk> and after they left i turn to my friend and give the biggest wtf look i have 
 it turns out they started ragging on me from the moment i entered and culminated in the sentence what does a guy like him think he should be doing in public with a lady like her '' 
 this is when she decides to pipe in with do you realise i understand everything you just said 
 thank you and fuck you '' 
 i could n't stop laughing 
 the two floor staff came to see if i was ok and we <unk> the story to them and they then told us they could n't understand why these two guys left in such a hurry 
 we had a good laugh for about 10 minutes i made my purchase and we <unk> tfr 
 i 'm a lurker past year+ no account 'til now as i had n't any interesting stories to share 
 i 'll be using this account just for this sub 
 i work at a chain grocery store 
 yesterday thursday night i was working a closing shift 
 it was 10:40 10 minutes past close 
 our intercom had already blared 3 different messages in the past half hour announcing our close and everyone but one older man had left the store 
 this older man proceeded to take his time 
 i 'm sure you know the story 
 he had *two* full carts of groceries 
 my manager said he 'd take the man as i needed to clock out by 10:40 so i turned off my light and prepared to leave 
 older man comes up to my lane and shouts excuse me just where do you think you 're going '' 
 me : oh i 'm heading out for the night sir 
 my manager can take you in the next lane over '' 
 man : no no no no 
 absolutely not 
 you do n't clock out until i check out 
 now get over here you lazy little teenager and do your job '' 
 i should mention i 'm in my twenties 
 i look young but not that young 
 grandpa was off his meds today 
 me : sir i am scheduled to leave at this time 
 though as i said my manager is right here and will be more than happy to check you out '' 
 man : that 's ridiculous 
 do i get some kind of discount for the inconvenience 
 and do n't forget my senior discount too '' 
 manager : sir i 'm right here next lane over 
 you do n't have to walk far '' 
 man : no you do n't understand 
 i 've been in this store for over an hour and now i 'm being <unk> because you want me out of here 
 are you the supervisor '' 
 manager : yes sir '' 
 man : good 
 then you will give me my two discounts '' 
 manager : i 'm afraid not sir 
 i can give your senior discount but i can not extend any other discounts or coupons today unless you have defective items or there is a similar issue '' 
 man : so if i break something you 'll give me a discount '' 
 at this point i observe my manager 's face in some kind of mixture of shock and disgust 
 of course my manager replies no and that merchandise broken deliberately by the customer must be paid for in full 
 old <unk> man <unk> <unk> 
 man : alright here 's a piece of paper boy 
 you 're going to write down your name and this teenager 's name so i can report you directly to corporate 
 first and last names '' 
 i did n't stick around to hear what my manager said next as i was now really past my leave time 
 today i heard my manager gave his name but not mine thank god 
 nothing came of it 
 old entitled people are the worst.edit scroll down for the story 
 : a lot of you are asking the same great questions and i realized that when i posted this at <unk> in the morning i did a poor job of explaining why i was upset at this girl so let me answer the questions getting asked the most 
 but first thank you to <unk> 
 i have a friend who is <unk> and he insists that there 's something wrong with him 
 i disagree completely 
 i understand that sometimes the chemicals in someone 's brain are off but that 's not something the person can help and it 's not their fault 
 they can be <unk> but that 's a whole other issue in itself and sometimes the medications do n't help or make it worse 
 i ca n't imagine how difficult it is to have your brain fight you on a daily basis 
 the reason i was so upset with this girl is because she copied my entire business down to the setup 
 she has no sign for her business and does n't leave cards out on her table 
 because her setup is the exact replica of mine people think she is part of my business which does have signs and cards on the table 
 this is what <unk> me for several reasons 
 one if we 're being honest the girl ca n't <unk> for shit which is why i would n't hire her 
 her lines are all over the place and she uses white thread for everything so you can always see the thread 
 it 's a pet peeve of mine 
 she also picks out either plain fabrics of cheap flower printed ones that do n't tend to sell and i do n't want people thinking that i 'm turning out that quality of work 
 it sounds mean i know and i 'm not trying to be mean 
 i used to work with my <unk> who was a tailor so i have a strong background in sewing and i do n't want people thinking i 'm <unk> sewing things with bad lines and poor workmanship 
 i 'm afraid that people are going to continue to think she 's associated with me and it will hurt my business 
 i believe i sell better because i carry a better quality of fabrics and i have a background in sewing so my sewing is neater 
 maybe not necessarily better but visually neater than hers 
 i also want to be known for quality items and quality fabric and i feel like with her not separately identifying herself from me that people will continue to think she is part of my business and it will <unk> poorly on me 
 why she does n't have her own signage i do n't know 
 i have in fact wondered if she does it purposely to try to gain some of my business 
 i have tried to talk to her and she was very <unk> about it going as far as to tell me i stole her ideas 
 i was in business three years before her so that and a few other conversations with her made me believe she does know what she 's doing but she treats me like i should just get over it and be okay with it because she can do whatever she wants 
 you really would n't outwardly know she was schizophrenic so her medications seems to be <unk> her at least enough that you would n't readily notice 
 but she acts extremely entitled and that 's what gets me about the situation 
 also as far as her pet photography i heard that she does n't do it anymore because she was n't showing up for appointments and such 
 this would n't surprise me because she has n't shown up for several vendor shows i know she was supposed to be at 
 people were asking me where she was because for some reason because of her set up / pricing <unk> people think she 's a part of my business or a side business to mine 
 i do n't want her ruining the reputation i worked hard to build 
 she essentially stole my entire business model and not just my ideas because i understand the ideas are not subject to <unk> and she 's welcome to make the same things as me 
 i see her as a liability more than competition 
 story time : a lot of you have been asking for the story of the girl who copied my entire business 
 i want to start off by saying that i will be brutally honest when telling this story because there 's a lot of layers to this that i feel are important for all of you to know 
 to this day i still do n't know if i should feel bad for her or just be really ticked off 
 i was doing a farmers market at the beginning of summer last year 
 farmers markets as i 've learned seem to be where trouble is 
 my partner had gotten up to walk around and then came back to the booth and told me that there was another girl clear at the other side of the market that did pet photography and had a few bandanas 
 she said she had spent some time talking to the girl who we will call a just because it 's the first letter of the <unk> and i was watching pretty little <unk> earlier like a teenager and that she was so genuinely kind 
 she wanted us talk because she seemed interested in finding someone who could dress the dogs she <unk> 
 this is n't a rare thing that happens 
 i 've done multiple shows where i was approached by pet photographers who wanted to purchase some of my items to have on hand to offer to people for <unk> because people will often want to dress up their dog and assume the photographer works like a <unk> photographer who has clothing options and different props to dress up the shoot on hand 
 i always work with them so that they could get a variety of items or let them photograph the booth and offer people a few options from those photos and then contact me later to buy certain items 
 no problem 
 i enjoy doing it 
 and every so often one of those photographers is amazing and will post the pictures online or the photos will make it into a local community paper 
 i went down and talked to a extensively 
 she was very sweet and looked familiar but i could n't place her 
 she had maybe ten dog bandanas totally different than mine in two sizes only at a totally different price point than mine and the rest of her table was just photography 
 she did n't have a tent or a whole booth - she just simply had one table without a tablecloth 
 she said this was n't something she wanted to do and she just brought a few bandanas with her to help make up the money she spent on the table but she did n't enjoy sewing or <unk> 
 she just wanted to get the word out about her photography business 
 now i 've been to a lot dog events and i 've seen a lot of professional dog photographers who have been doing this for several years 
 she was a self <unk> <unk> with a love for pet photography and her photography is just <unk> 
 she 's extremely talented 
 regardless of how i feel about her ripping off my business she is an extremely talented photographer 
 if i was n't a bit ticked at her i would hire her to photograph my pets in a heartbeat 
 a came down to my booth a little later and did the normal may i take some pictures of your booth to show my clients different options of what i can get for them to dress their pets in '' 
 she gave the reason that she realized all the work that went into making bandanas and she just did n't want to put the effort in 
 she would rather buy some items to have on hand and seemed particularly interested in the ties and bow ties 
 i 've heard this before too so i said yes and never thought anything of it 
 i had really enjoyed talking to her she seemed very sweet and this was a <unk> thing to happen so that was that 
 imagine my surprise when not quite two months later i showed up to a dog event to find her with literally every single thing i made made exactly the same way with the same set up down to using peg boards as bow tie displays and mini blackboards to price items to suddenly having multiple size bandanas and everything was the same price as mine 
 she also gained a tent and three tables with <unk> just like mine 
 oh and she does n't do pet photography anymore 
 i was floored 
 i can understand taking <unk> from someone but this was flat out copying my business 
 up until this point i was the only person in the area that had a business even remotely like this 
 everyone did bandanas but they were slightly higher priced than mine because i liked to be a little competitive and fair with my pricing and no one else carried bow ties ties and some of the other things i had 
 i was the only so called handmade full service '' pet vendor so this was obviously extremely <unk> to me 
 to make it worse she lives ten minutes from me so we 're selling to the exact same area 
 there 's nothing i can do about it because i ca n't prove she took pictures in my booth that day even though i can prove that my business started before hers 
 but is it worth trying to sue her over this 
 probably not 
 and it will just get me a bad name in the vendor community so it 's not worth it 
 after she set up she had the gall to come over and talk to me like she did n't just copy my entire business through the pictures she had taken of my booth 
 she even went as far as to ask me if i remembered her 
 i really felt like she thought she was complimenting me by copying me 
 then she picked up one of my dog toys that i did n't have at the farmers market and asked me how i made it 
 i kid you not 
 i politely pulled it from her hand and asked her to not come back in my booth which she did n't 
 at the end of the show after we were packed up she did come over and complain to me that she did horrible at the show and did n't make her table 
 the show was one of the best shows i did but i was n't going to tell her that 
 i just nodded sympathetically and went about my day 
 this was also <unk> the show where the dog ate my hamburger 
 that was a weird day friends 
 in the time since i 've found out there 's a few things that set us apart 
 i will buy the more expensive dog print fabrics 
 she will only buy generic fabrics that are on sale or clearance - little things like that 
 i do have a leg up on her in the form that i 've been doing this longer and know what sells and what does n't but also because even if she sees the more expensive fabric selling she refuses to buy anything over $ 3 a yard so that 's an advantage to me 
 the other advantage is that i 'm already signed up for several of the good shows in the area and i <unk> up every single year in that period where they give past vendors a chance to sign up first 
 these shows are all one vendor per type of item so all the shows she wants into she ca n't get into and i do n't have to worry about her copying more of my ideas at them 
 she even once asked me if i could not do the one show last year so she could get in 
 that blew my mind 
 i had already signed up and paid for it and was essentially the vendor in her way so that ended that because the show did n't give refunds 
 however she did start out not putting <unk> in her ties because that was something she could n't tell i did from a photograph 
 as soon as she realized i did it she started doing it too and advertising it like she was the only one in the world to do it 
 i learned fairly quickly that she was stalking my business facebook page and that every single time i would post something she would immediately copy it and then try to show it to me at a show 
 i ended up banning her from my business facebook page so that seemed to stop that nonsense 
 with the way she handled things and how bold she was to ask me how i made stuff not to do a show so she could etc i used to say to my business partner what is wrong with her '' 
 because that seemed like off '' behavior to me 
 one thing i did know about her from talking to her is that she would get a job keep it for a few months no longer work there and have to get a new job 
 i noticed with vendor shows that she would disappear for a month or two and then show back up and say she was working during those months she was missing 
 so she seems to only do the business when she 's not working 
 also kind of odd because the people i know either have a business or do n't 
 long story short what i did find out when she tried to friend me on facebook i rejected it because reasons 
 is that we went to high school together she was my age and a lot of my friends knew her hence why she looked so familiar that day at the farmers market 
 i explained the situation and asked a few really good friends who we had in common but i had known since childhood and was still really close about her just out of curiosity 
 all of them said that they do n't talk to her really but from being her facebook friend and having graduated with her i was pulled out of school during my first year of high school because i got incredibly ill and had to be <unk> so what happened in high school after that is news to me which is why i <unk> 
 they know that she is schizophrenic and on medication 
 her parents pay for all of her stuff including her apartment and the guy that comes with her to shows that we thought was her boyfriend is basically her caretaker 
 the stipulation of her parents paying for everything is that she has to work but every few months she seems to lose jobs which lines up with what i 've gotten from her in conversation 
 she has trouble getting hired again because the place where she worked wo n't give her a good reference so she makes and sales dog stuff in between working so that her parents do n't get mad at her 
 in retrospect i feel bad thinking something was wrong with her 
 <unk> is n't something that 's wrong '' with a person or something that they can help and i applaud her for starting her own business making her own stuff and trying to work 
 i really do 
 which is why i feel so bad about being mad at her 
 if i would have known all of this and she would have come to me and said she also wanted to make dog items but did n't know how i would have sat down and helped her come up with items and patterns specific to her brand 
 i 'm just that kind of person and i appreciate when people are upfront 
 i am literally willing to help anyone if they are honest with me 
 i did this with a friend of mine who needed extra income and did n't know how to craft 
 there 's tons of things she could have done that would n't have <unk> with what i was doing and she could have formed a brand around 
 but for her to just steal everything down to my set up and steal my brand out from under me 
 that gets the big old huh uh girlfriend 
 edit for tl dr - met a girl at a farmers market claiming to be a photographer 
 she asked to take pictures of my stuff which is normal photographer <unk> 
 then she copied my entire business down to my pricing my items and my set up 
 i 'm an assistant manager at a chain apparel store 
 & amp nbsp last night i was called up to the register to help deal with an irate customer who wanted to use multiple coupons at once 
 our systems only allow for two coupon codes at once but typically we do what we can to use three or four at once 
 sometimes it requires splitting the transaction and sometimes we can just do some <unk> to make it work 
 either way it 's technically against strict policy to do this but well we are n't exactly in the business to make people unhappy 
 & amp nbsp so this customer had three coupons : one to redeem for a free gift one a reward from our brand credit card and one $ 5 coupon given out from a store for an inconvenience 
 we had to scan in the gift code and we wanted to scan the reward to ensure that if returns were made the value was returned 
 the third my cashier wanted to simply override a few items for its total value but the customer was n't having it 
 & amp nbsp me : hey cashier 's name what 's going on '' 
 cashier : well we wanted to use coupons and ... '' customer who i 'll be calling b from now on : he wanted to use my coupon some weird way so that i lose out on my money '' 
 me : okay ... which coupons do we have here '' 
 my cashier showed me the coupons and explained his plan 
 it 's exactly what i would have done 
 me : well that 's the general process that i 'd use 
 if you want i can split the transaction and just use the code for your free gift on that '' 
 b : now why do you people make it so difficult 
 do n't do my coupon like that '' 
 me : which coupon ma'am '' 
 b : you 're going to use my $ 5 and just take it off so that i lose it if i have to make a return 
 the customer always gets screwed '' 
 me : ma'am it 's a coupon 
 if we use it normally it takes $ 5 and <unk> an equal part of it to each item in your transaction 
 it 's money that you are n't paying so you are n't losing it if you make a return '' 
 b : that 's stupid 
 why ca n't it just take it off the transaction total '' 
 me : that 's in effect what it does though ... '' b : store name is so greedy 
 god just do what you want '' 
 me : i understand that it can be a little frustrating 
 we 'll be taking off $ 2.50 from your most expensive items to use your coupon 
 that 's money you are not paying so you 're right you ca n't get it back either '' 
 & amp nbsp i was starting to get irritated at this point 
 & amp nbsp b : what about my rewards then 
 i 'm sure you 'll keep those too '' 
 me : if you make a return your reward coupon will be returned to your card in the form of the points you used to redeem it 
 that way if you return $ 10 of your $ 20 transaction you 'll get exactly half of your reward points back too '' 
 b : yeah right 
 that 's what they say 
 companies must spend so much time figuring out ways to screw me over '' 
 me : you 're okay then cashier 
 i 'll be over here if you need me again '' 
 & amp nbsp i walked away 
 she left still fuming a few minutes later 
 i sent my cashier away to do something in the back so he could have some time away from the sales floor 
 & amp nbsp it seems like every time we try to help a customer out and go above and beyond it <unk> on our faces 
 i think from now on we 'll hold to company policy because honestly if they 're going to be calling corporate because they 're pissed off i 'd rather it be because we held to policy than because we tried to <unk> it 
 & amp nbsp it 's just sad because the nice customers are really the ones who get screwed '' because of <unk> like <unk> many moons ago during college i had a crappy job at a now-mostly-defunct franchise coffee chain store 
 the shop was owned by a <unk> team -- we 'll call them bill and nancy <unk> not their real names of course 
 i was hired in the late summer before their store opened for business and had developed a good relationship with them over the next few months 
 i even babysat their two children on <unk> when their nanny had the night off 
 they trusted me to come to their house and inventory orders in their garage when they were n't around 
 but this story is n't about their kids or their garage 
 i had been working at the store for about 8 months and it was now late spring my college semester was about to end 
 my time at the store would be ending soon as well - the richmans were aware that one of the reasons that i slaved away for them was that i was saving up as much money as i could for a summer trip to <unk> and i would be quitting the job before <unk> day 
 so it was a few weeks from d-day that bill asked me to come in to the store on a saturday to spend my shift cleaning out the very tiny and always extremely <unk> stock room to make room for a big shipment coming in later in the week 
 he <unk> told me to wear <unk> clothes as opposed to the <unk> uniform as i 'd be making lots of trips out to the dumpsters as well as <unk> some neglected areas and would not be helping customers that day 
 it was an <unk> and therefore highly memorable offer as bill and nancy were pretty strict about employee <unk> 
 i arrived for my shift that saturday wearing jeans and an old t-shirt looking for the cleaning supplies i was told that nancy had brought in that morning for me to use 
 little did i or anybody else know it was on that very day the owners of the parent company also a husband and wife team would decide to pop in to the shop for a little surprise visit - their first ever to that store 
 i found out later this is what happened moments after the high lord and lady of <unk> set their eyes on me : in furious whispers to the richmans the company owners demanded to know why i had arrived to work not wearing the <unk> dress code 
 bill <unk> to not have a clue why i would show up to work that way 
 nancy <unk> *what could spaetzele have been thinking 
 * '' thrown right 
 under 
 the 
 bus 
 the company owners demanded that i be fired on the spot for the offense and stand-up people that they were bill and nancy stood by me and refused to do it because i was a loyal employee who had always worked hard for them since the day they had opened and by the way i had been told to dress exactly that way <unk> <unk> 
 no wait sorry 
 that did n't happen 
 what actually happened was that they told the owners that they too could n't tolerate my <unk> <unk> and pledged i would be fired that very day 
 being the honorable people they were they actually passed off the task of firing me to the store manager i suppose so they would n't ever have my wtf face burned into their <unk> for all eternity 
 to recap so far : told to work out of uniform by bosses bosses get caught by corporate i am <unk> and fired 
 the story does n't end here though 
 having just found out i was fired for an absolutely ridiculous and frankly totally lazy and insulting reason my first instinct was to get pissed throw my apron in their faces and give them my best double salute as i marched out the door 
 but my second instinct was ... well i really do need that next pay check before i go on my trip and hell everyone knows i was going to quit anyway 
 so i <unk> to the manager that i just work the remainder of the couple of weeks as originally intended 
 she got the ok from the richmans who i now could not even look in the face without fantasizing about throwing hot coffee at them and i worked until the week before i was due to fly away 
 my last shift finally comes - a closing shift 
 right before we were about to lock the store 's door behind us for the night the telephone rang 
 the other employee i was working with - a good friend - answered it and handed over the reciever telling me it was bill and he wanted to talk to me 
 i do n't want to talk to bill i just want to go home '' i said thinking he was going to give me some drippy goodbye speech but the truth was i was that once i saw the richmans true colors i was glad to see the back of them and did n't feel the need to pretend we were parting on friendly terms 
 just take it so we can get out of here '' my friend said 
 so i took the telephone and said yes bill '' 
 hey spaetzele '' said bill in a <unk> <unk> voice i just wanted to wish you well on your trip and ask you if you 'll be coming to back to work with us when you return '' 
 i <unk> 
 i gave my friend my best is this shit for real '' 
 face 
 i cleared my throat and replied well no bill 
 i am not coming back to the store 
 that is not the plan '' 
 bill - shocked - asked but why not 
 you ca n't just leave us 
 we 'll miss you '' 
 gag 
 controlling rage i did n't know it was even possible to feel i told bill : bill you know exactly why 
 *you fired me* 
 today is my last day of work and i am never going to come back here '' 
 bill : oh c'mon you know - '' click 
 i hung up on him 
 turned off the light locked the door and had an awesome trip 
 **tl/dr - got told to wear clothes to clean in got fired for doing what i was asked boss attempted to un-fire me on my last day fuck that shit 
 **i work part time at a fairly well-known steak house chain 
 i was working there waiting tables last night following a full day 's shift at my day job 
 i was n't brough on until <unk> so i come in and hit the ground running 
 it 's the middle of the dinner rush i 'm not sure of my <unk> because i have n't had a minute to stop running and check 
 suffice to say it was stressful 
 then i get the table with the mother her <unk> yr old daughter and her ~3 year old son 
 while taking orders she asks if we accept a coupon code on her phone and holds it up to show me the words it 's her birthday '' 
 well after getting all the food out i had the manager comp them a gargantuan chocolate <unk> for dessert 
 i even went and put candles on it managed to find a lighter to light them the whole shebang 
 the girl loved it 
 at the end of the night the woman had tipped me just over 15 % 
 but the best part of the night came when the 3-4 year old says in their cute little attempted language <unk> for the <unk> and ketchup and cake then launches himself from the booth and wraps his arms around me in the best hug i 've had in months 
 made my week 
 that there 's a tale from retail i hope y'all can appreciate almost as much as i <unk> needed a manager to allow the current transaction to continue but it was a busy day and had to wait for a manager when the guy behind them asked what the hold up was in a friendly way this guy was n't rude at all and realized we needed a manager he mentioned he knew how to get a manager to show up 
 then he yells what do you mean there 's no manager '' and like 5 seconds later a manager shows up 
 he mentioned he took a while because he was being yelled at by another <unk> here from the den of appliance parts 
 i love customers ... & gt angry lady : i ordered a part from here and you never called me '' 
 & gt me : okay let me take a look ... here we go '' 
 -i go to get her order- & gt al : why did n't you call 
 i gave you my number ... why say you 're going to call if you do n't call '' 
 & gt me : we call as soon as we get the parts ma'am '' 
 -place parts on <unk> & gt al : no you did n't you never call ... i just do n't see the point in taking my number if you do n't call '' 
 & gt me : -place her <unk> ticket on the counter and point at it- is that your number '' 
 & gt al : yes '' 
 & gt me : -point at another spot on the ticket with my <unk> i called on the 26th and again on the 10th at these specific times and left a message on your machine 
 here 's your parts and your <unk> have a nice day '' 
 i just smiled at her as she muttered something about never getting the messages 
 not my fault you do n't know how to you use your voice mail guys 
 this just happened to me and i 'm so disturbed and amused all at once 
 i work at a sandwich place in southern california and today i am register 
 i will be the first to say that i have a crude sense of humor and that i am well aware old people give exactly zero fucks 
 i will fondly call this woman crazy old woman cow 
 the order has already been placed and as standard practice i ask for identification whenever someone uses their card 
 me : may i see your id please 
 cow : which breast 
 left or right 
 <unk> adjusting them while <unk> me : oh my god 
 cow : have you ever heard about the worst form of rejection 
 me : ... no 
 cow : are you over 18 honey 
 me : <unk> interested and amused now* 22 
 cow : lean in close 
 <unk> the worst form of rejection is when your hand falls asleep while <unk> 
 i literally did n't know how to react instead of just laughing 
 it honestly made me believe i would be like that when i 'm older 
 definitely one to remember 
 i used to work for a major clothing store that i wo n't name but uses a lot of <unk> advertising and makes their clothes in la 
 let 's call it absolutely awful aa 
 i was 21 and had been working at an aa in san <unk> for about three months 
 during my time my manager who was three years older than me let 's call her young bitch made it clear from day one she was not to be messed with '' 
 fine whatever i kept my head down and did my job but young bitch kept <unk> me for days i was n't scheduled especially opening shifts and after waking up for the fourth opening in a row i needed a break so i requested a monday and tuesday off so i could go down to los angeles and visit my family relax a little 
 everything approved i made it to la on saturday 
 by that night i was feeling terrible 
 <unk> <unk> hot and cold flashes and the beginning of a sore throat 
 at least i was home my mom was there to feed me chicken soup and it was n't bad having the time off 
 at least i would n't have to use my sick days 
 sunday i am walking death 
 <unk> on blast spent tissues <unk> the floor my pillow is soaked completely through with sweat and <unk> 
 i get a call from my manager 
 yb : we need you to come in tomorrow 
 me : hey nice to hear from you too but i 'm really really sick and i 'm on vacation you approved the days yourself 
 yb : well you 're on the schedule <unk> to be on call separate from being scheduled for shifts and we need you to come in and open 
 me : i 'm not doing that 
 i literally have an over 100 degree <unk> 
 yb : well we 'll just have to see how that goes over with her boss 
 now i really needed this job 
 this was around the deepest part of the <unk> and was the first job of any kind that i 'd found in months 
 this was not a good situation to be in 
 me : i 'll call around and find someone to cover for me then because i 'm sick in los angeles 
 yb : no 
 we need you to come in you 've had three shifts covered this month 
 long story short in desperation and sickness i decided i 'd fucking drive back up overnight come in work the shift then go to my apartment and die there 
 i loaded up on asprin and water took a hot shower packed up my car and took the 5. halfway through around <unk> i had to stop at a rest station for gas and i passed out in the front seat waiting for my tank to fill 
 i rolled up to the storefront at exactly 5am 
 i looked like hell and i knew it so i opened and went into the back bathroom to <unk> up and change 
 when i stepped out both of my managers were waiting for me which was strange 
 young bitch told me not to clock in and to follow them into their tiny office 
 then she said it 
 we 're going to have to let you go '' 
 i glared at them both the other manager had n't said a word 
 why could n't you heavy coughing do this over the phone '' i wheezed 
 she stared 
 we needed you to come in so you could pick up your check '' 
 she handed me a sealed envelope my address on the front 
 all you fucking had to do was stamp this 
 look at me look at how sick i am and you made me drive from los angeles to get fired 
 i shouted 
 young bitch started to mutter some excuse but i was n't fucking having it 
 i turned around and walked out slamming the door with my last check in hand 
 i went home downed a bit of whiskey drew a bath and finished the whiskey 
 when i woke up i felt better than i had in a while 
 tl dr my boss made me drive from la to sf to fire me in person while i had the <unk> work as a fill manager at a grocery store in australia 
 one day i am <unk> on the floor hastily stuff <unk> into the lower shelf 
 an elderly chinese lady arrives holding an empty box and tries to get my attention 
 i ask her if i could help her and she points at the box and makes a 'psshh sound 
 she obviously does n't speak english so i try to communicate to her through mime 
 i assume she wants the item that would have been in the box but not 
 she <unk> again the box the 'psshh then the points to her knee and says 'owe 
 its all clicking through my head until she then points to my knees 
 'owe 
 she wants me to kneel on the cardboard so that i do n't hurt my knees 
 i feel sad that so few people care that the <unk> <unk> feel pain and misery like everybody else 
 but happy that every so often you run into somebody who treats you like a human <unk> here 's a story from my time at <unk> canadian coffee shop that i was reminded of from a previous story today 
 when i worked there i was the only male to work the counter in the general area that <unk> a dozen stores 
 seeing the girls get hit on by creepy guys was a daily occurrence and most of them laughed about it and so did i eventually 
 so this day it was a hot afternoon in july and the store was sweltering 
 company policy said that we had to keep all the buttons done up right to the throat 
 where it was so hot our manager gave us permission to waive the policy that day and unbutton the top button of our uniform 
 i was working the window taking money and passing out drinks seriously 
 who the fuck gets coffee in the middle of a heat wave 
 one guy comes to the window gets his coffee and pays with a $ 5 bill 
 i pass him his change about $ 3 and he tells me to keep it 
 puzzled i tell him how much it is 
 he says that 's fine and drives off 
 i shrug my shoulders put it in the tip jar and tell the girls 
 they giggle and we move on to the next customer 
 over the course of the next 2 hours he comes through 4 more times leaving his change each time 
 after the last time my supervisor looks at me laughs and tells me to unbutton the next button to see if i can get a bigger tip from him or at least his phone number 
 tl dr : got hit on by a gay guy that everyone knew was gay except me 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 3200 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new year’s eve 
 **story : ** fireworks are supposed to be exciting and fun and i want my customers to have that same experience when they shop at my store 
 i try very hard to make sure that every person leaves my store with a smile on their face 
 this is the story of someone who did not 
 during the rush this past 4th my so grabbed me and told me that we had a customer who was very upset 
 i dropped what i was doing and followed her 
 i immediately recognized the guy as one of our regulars who spends a lot of money 
 he’s an older gentleman probably in his <unk> and he had always been reasonably nice when i had previously helped him 
 he was standing just outside of the tent with his shopping cart and he was obviously pissed off 
 as soon as he saw me the profanity filled tirade started 
 it was loud and obscene enough that i noticed that people within <unk> of us were turning around to watch 
 as he is going off one of my cashiers and my so walk up behind me 
 apparently one of our credit card machines was not working properly when he was trying to make a purchase 
 the cashier had swiped his card three separate times and he was convinced that he was going to be charged three times 
 the cashier kept trying to explain to him that it wasn’t taking the card and that she had only put in the charge amount one time so it wouldn’t charge him three times 
 my so tries to tell him that she can quickly run a report to make sure that he wasn’t charged three times 
 he keeps interrupting both of them to tell them that they’re wrong and that he doesn’t have time for them to run a @ # $ @ % report 
 in the meantime he’s now spent 5 minutes standing in the parking lot spewing obscenities 
 i kept trying to interject and defuse the situation but he refused to stop screaming and just shouted over me every time i tried to talk to him 
 a few of the priceless gems that i remember : & gt **guy : ** i see how you run a fucking business 
 your cashier was rude to me and never apologized 
 & gt & gt **guy : ** if you people knew what the fuck you were doing we wouldn’t be standing here 
 & gt & gt **guy : ** i spend a lot of money here but i’m never coming back here again if this is the way you treat your good customers 
 & gt & gt **guy : ** now i have to take the time to call my credit card company to dispute your fucking charges 
 & gt & gt **guy : ** i’m going to call the radio station where i advertise and let them know what a piece of shit place this is 
 & gt & gt **guy : ** i’m going to sue you for wasting my time 
 during this entire tirade i’m continually trying to talk to him but he just keeps shouting over me 
 ... remember that scene in <unk> <unk> <unk> where <unk> loses it 
 yeah that’s pretty much what happened to me 
 & gt **me : ** yelling even louder than him if you would just shut the fuck up for a second maybe i could help you 
 he was stunned 
 he just looked at me for a second and then said “what are you going to do ” i walked inside the tent grabbed an item similar to what he had in his cart then walked back out and handed it to him 
 & gt **me : ** still yelling have a nice day 
 i then turned around and walked back into the tent 
 i’ll be honest when i first went back into the tent i was planning to grab cash from the register to refund his money hand him the cash take back the firework from his cart and tell him to get the fuck out 
 in a split second i decided to take the high road 
 i’m still on the fence as to whether i made the right decision 
 i did go back afterward and verify that we only charged him one time 
 i can tell you one thing 
 if he comes back this year he’s going to have to apologize to my entire staff before i sell him anything i do n't care how much money he spends 
 **edit : ** i should also mention that i was embarrassed by my behavior 
 i still ca n't believe i snapped 
 i think part of it was that the guy yelling and cussing at my so as well 
 i do n't tolerate men yelling at women very well and yelling at my so even less 
 -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here i came into work particularly grumpy today so on my lunch break i decided to overdose on caffeine 
 i worked drive thru on the dinner rush and i was all smiles and bouncing off the walls with positivity really trying to give it my best 
 then i took an order from a clearly <unk> - aggressive old lady 
 i tried to kill her with kindness all the while i <unk> she would complain about something 
 was she going to complain about the price 
 was she going to say her food was too cold 
 was she going to complain about the wait time 
 i kept trying to guess what she would try to pull but she did n't say anything she just had this hard frown on her face and spoke with a <unk> growl 
 i got through the whole transaction without issue and i was convinced i had avoided a complaint ... but at the very end before she drove away she shoots me this death glare and says : & gt you really need to calm down young man 
 nobody should be that happy while there is so much suffering in the world '' 
 of all the things i was <unk> she would say that was not one of them 
 so i just kind of had this blank stare on my face as she drove away 
 of course a minute later i figured i could have replied with smiles are part of the uniform ma'am 
 have a nice day '' 
 but it was too late 
 so i guess she won that round 
 edit : thank you for the gold 
 you have brought me a smile 
 : *phone <unk> me : thank you for calling store how may i help you '' 
 customer c : what time do you close '' 
 me : we close at 7:00 exactly '' c : if i get there at 7:05 will you be able to help '' 
 me : unfortunately not we close at 7 and our system will be shut down for the night '' c : but why ca n't you help me '' 
 m : because we 'll be closed '' 
 c : but competitor stays open later why wo n't you help me '' 
 me : because we 'll be closed '' c : *hangs <unk> work at the service desk at a grocery store which has a gas station in the parking lot 
 it is the service desk job to relieve the people running it for their breaks and lunches so normally i spend about an hour a day out there 
 i could go on forever about the crazy things i have seen people do or things i have been yelled at for but this one takes the cake 
 it took place a few years ago but i 'll tell it as best i can 
 it was just an average day and i was out at fuel to relieve a lunch 
 i look up from my phone and see a woman fast approaching 
 she looks pissed 
 i greet her through the intercom and ask how i can help her 
 let 's call her dumb broad because that 's what she was 
 **dumb broad** : i believe i just filled my car up with diesel but i know i selected <unk> 
 the price is higher and i want a refund 
 i did not select diesel 
 now at this point i should mention i was exhausted and did n't even want to put up with her much less try and figure out how she accidentally filled her car with diesel 
 **me** : um okay 
 i 'm sorry that happened 
 well i ca n't refund that out here without approval but if you would like to go inside and talk to a manager they might be able to help you out 
 she huffs and puffs and walks back to her car to drive it closer to the store 
 now again i was exhausted and did n't even think to tell her that probably was n't the best idea to even start the car but that 's what she gets for being an idiot 
 shortly after my co-worker returns from lunch and i head back into the store 
 when i walk in i see the dumb broad standing at the counter talking to a manager 
 she sees me walk in and points 
 **dumb broad** : she told me you guys would refund it for me 
 she said she could n't but you would 
 **manager** : did you tell her that 
 **me** : no i said you guys might be able to help her but that 's it 
 **manager** *face lights up* : wait a second is n't the handle for diesel entirely it 's own on the opposite side of the pump and bright green 
 **me** : why yes yes it is now that you mention it 
 **manager** : and is n't the nozzle that goes into the tank bigger so that it does n't fit into <unk> vehicles 
 also yes 
 i had n't thought of either of these things 
 now dumb broad seems extra dumb and i 'm trying not to giggle 
 **manager** : so how exactly did you manage to fill up without realizing that the handle was bright green and labeled diesel and that the nozzle did n't fit in your car 
 **dumb broad** : well i held the handle outside of the tank the whole time and let the gas run in because i was n't sure why it did n't fit 
 this is ridiculous and i just want a refund 
 **manager** : okay well this is not our fault in the slightest seeing as were multiple warnings that you were using the incorrect nozzle 
 i suggest you call a tow truck to go get your tank drained because if you try to drive your car it is going to break down 
 have a nice day 
 the look on this lady 's face was amazing 
 she used our phone to call for a tow truck and ended up waiting almost 3 hours for someone to come get her 
 tl dr : do n't be oblivious to what you are doing or you will not only be humiliated but also have a pretty penny to pay for <unk> do you know when someone <unk> a porno <unk> too much 
 when the police show up at the smut <unk> with a warrant on the person trying to locate him 
 you could try going to family 
 you could try going to friends 
 naw you just go down to the local dildo ranch because the guy is known to be there all the time 
 sadly luckily 
 he was n't at the whack <unk> when they came that time 
 i have not seen him in a bit so i’m guessing they managed to track him <unk> a call from a customer requesting a refund of a non-refundable deposit scheduled installation of an alarm 
 i informed them it 's non-refundable but i can transfer to another <unk> issue store credit etc 
 they demand to speak to a manager of course 
 i begin to explain that the manager is on vacation overseas for 10 days but she cuts me off every time getting increasingly <unk> 
 & gt me : the manager is ... '' & gt c : i do n't @ # # 
 care 
 put the 
 @ # # manager on the phone 
 now '' 
 soon she 's cutting me off with screaming profanity before i can get a word out 
 she caught the idea that the manager is n't available at the moment '' and demanded to hold until they are 
 yes ma'am 
 hold away i have paying customers to assist 
 our phone beeps every 5 minutes so you do n't forget someone is on hold 
 my associate picked it up thanked her for holding and asked if he can help 
 she asked if he 's the manager he said no and she started over again 
 soon all staff knew a crazy lady was holding for the manager and not to pick up the hold line 
 an hour later she finally hangs up and calls back furious 
 again cuts me off as soon as i speak and demands to talk to a manager 
 she 's shrieking like a demon at this point barely <unk> like a female don <unk> 
 again demands to hold for the manager 
 again i put her on hold 
 another half hour and she hangs up 
 soon after she 's in our store screaming that she missed work and went over her cell minutes because she was on hold and we now owe her the entire deposit and her lost wages and need to reimburse her cell phone charges or she 's going to sue us 
 demands to talk to the manager 
 & gt me : ma'am as my associate and i tried to tell you multiple times the manager is on vacation overseas for 10 days '' 
 & gt c : then why did you put me on hold 
 why did you waste my time '' 
 & gt me : you screamed profanity and demanded to be put on hold for the manager and refused to talk to anyone else 
 multiple times '' 
 screaming stopped 
 demands stopped 
 profanity stopped 
 she asked what day the manager would be back in her normal person voice nodded her head and walked out without another word 
 never came back never called missed her appointment did n't answer reminder calls and now the deposit has turned to store <unk> the moment the supermarket that i work at is having a sale on toilet paper 
 it is a pretty big saving - half price off one of the more <unk> brands making it a good deal 
 there are 24 rolls to the packet so the limit of 3 per customer should n't be too much of a problem ... i mean 72 rolls of toilet paper will last you a while 
 anyway my story begins with a middle aged man lets call him angry customer or ac who came in and went straight to the toilet paper display area and loaded his trolley shopping cart with as many packs that he could fit totally disregarding the limit 3 per customer '' sign that was next to the price in the catalogue and even taped onto some of the packs of toilet paper that he had put into his trolley 
 i noticed him line up at one of the checkouts and as i was supervising i thought i would politely tell him about the limit before he gets to the front of the line and hold things up 
 me : excuse me sir but we have a limit of 3 packs of toilet paper per customer sorry 
 ac : no that 's okay i 'll just take these he smirks at me me : sorry but you have 7 packs in your trolley but we can only sell you 3. ac : what 
 why 
 this is the special for this week 
 me : yes i know that however in order for all customers to have a chance at buying a -- - i was cut off ac : it was in the catalogue and advertised on tv so you have to sell them to me 
 me : it was also advertised as having a limit of 3 per customer 
 we will gladly sell you 3 packs but that is all 
 at this point it is his turn to be served and he turns away from me and hands the cashier one pack telling her that he has 7 in total that he will pay for 
 i then interrupted me : excuse me sir but like i said we can not sell you more than 3 packs ac : am i talking to you 
 just let me pay and piss off 
 at this point i did n't even bother <unk> and the cashier had stopped scanning after the 3rd pack and we all just stood there waiting for him to either pay or leave 
 he then proceeded to take out the extra packs that we would n't sell to him and toss them on the floor and then told me that i was a smartass '' 
 do you want to know what the worst part about this is 
 basically the same thing happens at least once a shift where i inform customers of the limit ... i guess the only positive is that i 'm becoming immune to the idiotic comments they make about me to try and make themselves feel better after being called out on their shit 
 tl dr : customer does n't want to understand the concept of limit 3 per customer '' 4 years ago a customer wanted a discount on a lunch bag that was <unk> missing an item 
 the tag stated <unk> lunch container '' 
 the customer <unk> was an extra container was included with the lunch bag 
 after politely informing her she was wrong and showed her the rest of them did n't include extra items she called me a fat grinch 
 i never forgot her or her horrible <unk> tattoo 
 between then and now i was transferred and promoted 
 i also shaved my head and lost about 40 pounds 
 1 day ago said customer happened to apply for a job at my location 
 i did not know it was her based on the name 
 however once seeing her and her tattoo she wore denim <unk> i knew it was her 
 i do not think she initially remembered me or the incident 
 towards the end of the interview we talked about handling tough situations 
 i asked her how she would handle a customer making remarks about their personal appearance 
 the light bulb came on and she remembered me 
 after thanking her for her time she was on her way out 
 looking at her app she had been <unk> for 3 years 
 it felt so good rejecting that candidate 
 and for legal reason i rejected her based on appearance and not making eye contact 
 edit : she kinda <unk> like the girl on the right but with a pixie cut 
 not a super awful story but irritating just the same 
 i worked in a department-type store last summer 
 like most department stores we sold some candy <unk> corn and stuff at the front register but no actual food like meals or anything 
 this one lady comes up to me at the register and asks if we sell lunch 
 i say no and she asks where she could get it 
 there 's a wendy 's and a <unk> express across the street as well as a few local stores so i name those 
 she shakes her head and says no i want lunch '' 
 i then name a <unk> high end places nearby thinking she wants a good nice lunch 
 she then yells no 
 i want lunch '' 
 and <unk> holding a bag 
 a ... <unk> '' 
 i ask 
 she then yells yes that 's what she wanted and is confused as to why i would think she wanted lunch 
 i tell her no we do n't sell those and she huffs and says you do n't sell lunch ... '' 
 i 'm sorry for thinking that you meant lunch when you said lunch i work at a rising chain of supermarkets in the uk have done for a year 
 around february we hired a new girl 
 finally we have sacked her and it 's not a moment too soon 
 there were many things that she could have been sacked for as she never made it out of the probation period but this was the final one 
 most of this is second hand knowledge as i wa n't there 
 i 'm in on an early shift from 5:30 till 1pm 
 not keen on those shifts for several reasons but whatever i was doing it 
 ng new girl is meant to be in at 12 and would take over the primary checkout from me 
 does n't turn up till 3 and as we were short staffed i stayed an extra half hour as we were unable to take my till and cash it up due to the safe key changing hands at roughly the same time 
 basically everyone was annoyed with her at this point and if i 'd not already gone home when she arrived i 'd have had a go at her 
 she turns up in a bad mood already 
 the duty manager a woman in her 40 's she 's really nice and does n't lose her temper with anyone pleasure to work with tells her to go on the primary checkout 
 she refuses 
 dm tells her again to do it 
 ng says 'fine but these customers are going to fucking get it today i 'm not in the mood 
 another colleague was also in the room at this point so could verify this 
 i do n't have a problem with people getting annoyed and saying things about customers when they 're not there but given how she acted it 's relevant 
 she goes out and is apparently clearly sulking but doing her job 
 until she gets to a customer with a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables ... <unk> 's being quite careless with it while i was n't there this is standard she 's careless in general and she probably bruised some apples and other fruit 
 he tells her to be more careful 
 she <unk> and says nothing to him in return or for the rest of the transaction other than to say the cost 
 he hands over the money she throws the change across the checkout at him 
 claims she dropped it but again another co-worker can verify she 's lying 
 customer complains and is asked if he 'll write a statement for us we want rid of ng while the colleague who saw this all happen also writes one 
 on the day of her disciplinary she comes in accuses dm and other colleague of lying and the customer uses a statement from her mother saying <unk> would n't do that as a <unk> and threatens to sue the shop for wrongful <unk> 
 never seen the rest of the staff so happy 
 i should n't be happy to see someone fired but she deserves it 
 i 've posted before about her and why she 's a bad employee 
 tl dr - being awful at your job tends to end in losing your job 
 edit - top of tfr 
 wow did not expect this 
 just a note there 's much more to why she 's a bad employee this is just the tale of her <unk> tfr 
 second post i work at an entertainment park 
 a given customer will walk through the front door up to the front desk pay for wristband s and enter the park 
 we get dozens of people an hour and we bring in stupid amounts of money 
 because of this we do hourly cash drops and therefore can not accept bills larger than <unk> we even have a fancy little sign taped to the surface of the front desk that says so ... saturday afternoon busiest time of the week 
 sixty person line out the door 
 scraggly dad gets to the front with his child and we exchange the usual back and forth 
 his total comes out to something like 17 dollars and he drops a crumpled <unk> on the counter 
 me : '' sorry sir 
 we can not accept bills larger than $ 50 '' 
 sd : '' you 're kidding me right 
 you people bring in thousands of dollars every day and you ca n't take a hundred '' 
 me : '' i really ca n't take it it 's just policy '' sd : '' no you 'll take my hundred i know you have change 
 just give me my wristband and my change '' <unk> hundred <unk> me : '' unfortunately due to our volume of income we have to drop register into the safe every hour i could n't break your 100 even if there was n't a policy '' 
 sd : '' look kid i 'm 21 <unk> dude was 19 he had to sign a waiver and i saw his birthday you have to break my hundred 
 you do n't have a sign and i know you have change '' 
 *reaches for wristband that i pulled out beforehand i pull it back and he slams his palm on the table* me : '' sir as you can see here *point to his hand which is covering the <unk> we can not accept your 100 dollar bill 
 it is policy clearly stated if you can not pay then you 'll have to step out of line '' 
 sd then sighs a big fat sigh his cute little kid is completely oblivious and pulling on sd 's <unk> leg to get into the park poor little guy 
 but wait sd turns to the massive line of impatient people and yells at the top of his lungs can anyone here break a freakin 100 dollar bill '' 
 his voice cracked and his son started crying 
 everyone in line silently gives him one of these and sd finally grabs his 100 grabs his wailing kids wrist and leaves the park 
 while i was happy the dude left and of course i felt bad for the kid this is nowhere near any of the <unk> parents that <unk> our <unk> 
 still what a rude guy 
 edit : did n't expect so much attention let me clarify some things 
 a. the dude must have eventually returned with change because i saw him and his kid half an hour later in the park i did n't check him in 
 b. it was 11 dollars for him and 6 dollars for his kid 
 c. as most of you can figure out for yourselves i do n't make the freakin policy 
 i personally have no issues with taking a hundred dollar bill usually we have enough change in the drawer at the time i did not and we have those counterfeit detecting pens but it 's not my policy 
 i ca n't do it 
 some think it 's terrible i personally think it 's a good idea i would n't want to lose thousands of dollars if my business was robbed so drop your cash 
 if you sometimes ca n't break hundreds because of that just do n't take <unk> less to worry about 
 <unk> depending on the gm who is working with us behind the desk we can take 100 's if it 's a slow day and the total is more than $ 50 
 this instance was neither of those things 
 <unk> people keep saying i am a jerk for the way i handled this guy i get that 
 but where i work you follow policy strictly or you 're fired and after 4 hours of screaming children rude parents and dozens of birthday <unk> i am in no mood to give special treatment to one stubborn angry guy 
 edit2 : also for those saying i should get a manager which customers ask for as well the manager is usually in his office on the other side of the park and hardly answers his phone 
 i know it 's <unk> but i just work there 
 also the manager is just going to follow his policy 
 that 's how it is most places like this it 's <unk> a <unk> for customers but usually it just makes everyone 's life <unk> work at a large retail store that you have probably been to 
 i work in the produce department so that means i get to stock fruit and vegetables and fun things like that 
 anyways yesterday i was working and it was a busy day for a sunday 
 i live in a religious area where not many people go do stuff on sundays the entire day people had been ruder than usual 
 i usually have no problems with my job everyone is nice and i enjoy being nice to people and helping people out when they have questions but it seemed that yesterday everyone was grumpy for some reason 
 nothing big enough to make a post solely about that but grumpier than usual 
 i was stocking some <unk> when someone touched my shoulder and said excuse me young man '' 
 right when i heard this i got a little nervous because i 've learned in my time on the job that when someone is going to be especially rude it 's an elderly man 
 i turned around and put on my smile and said yes 
 how can i help you '' 
 i was expecting a rude tone about something because his face seemed a little distressed but instead he smiled as well and said do you have any corn 
 there is n't any in the bin it 's usually kept in '' 
 i realized that i had been stocking everything else but somehow in the rush of the day i had forgotten to stock the corn and now it was empty causing a misfortune for a lot of customers 
 i 'm sorry sir 
 i 'll hurry and get the corn from the back 
 i know we have some back there '' 
 and i rushed off to get the corn 
 when i got back i began to stock the corn 
 the old man stayed around though and began to have a conversation with me 
 he was a very nice old man and asked how long i 'd been working at where i worked at how the day was going if my boss was working me hard 
 it was nice to actually have a person kind of appreciate what i was doing instead of acting like i was their slave 
 as i finished stocking the corn and went back to my other tasks i said to him i 'm sorry i did n't have the corn stocked originally that was my fault '' 
 he said do n't worry about it 
 even if you did n't have any corn there are more important things in life than corn '' 
 the old man 's conversation made me happy the rest of the day 
 i wish that every person who gives me a glare or mutters something under their breath whenever i say we 're out of something would understand that there are more important things in life than item and that being rude is n't going to get them what they want 
 tl dr : old guy makes me <unk> i work in a convenience store and on a daily basis i have to deal with lottery addicts and alcoholics 
 some of these people are terrible 
 others are okay and some are my favorite people in the world 
 i was dealing with a guys lottery numbers and he plays probably 20 or 30 tickets that i have to scan and send 
 a third of the way through 3 or 4 people walk in to the store which is kind of a lot for us as we are small 
 i usually try and take care of the person i have first then move on to the beer and cigarette people because that is quicker 
 so as i 'm taking care of lotto guy this rude alcoholic man child walks up and slams his $ 5.00 bottle of watered down vodka on the counter waits 5 seconds and says fucking lottery people '' 
 there are 4 people around all waiting patiently for their various purchases and the lotto guy i was working on was being very kind 
 so i stop everything and say excuse me sir 
 you can either wait hate patiently like an adult or you can wait like a child and get out of here '' 
 he was taken aback and he <unk> i 'll wait ... i 'm patient ... '' i finished up with lotto guy and then took care of the <unk> up baby 
 he left and then all the i other people in the store started laughing their asses off 
 one woman who plays lottery there told me she was glad i said something because she was about to jump on his back 
 it was a good day for this minimum wage worker 
 tl dr : i made a drunk old man apologize like a child for being <unk> used to be an assistant manager at a food service establishment that was a national chain 
 against my recommendation my general manager hired one of our employees <unk> what he was <unk> on who she was lying to at the time to be a baker 
 after we hired him we noticed food would go missing and that the freezer was starting to smell a lot like marijuana 
 i 'm not talking about a little food 
 it would be whole <unk> and hams 
 needless to say we watched the videos and fired him for various reasons stealing <unk> of drug policy 
 apparently in state it is required that when an employee is fired that their last paycheck has to be issued and mailed within 3 days of termination 
 on the 3rd day after the termination the <unk> calls and demands that i give him his paycheck 
 i informed him that his check would not be coming to the restaurant but would be mailed to his address that we had on file 
 i then provided him with the number for our corporate payroll department that he could call if he had questions 
 in a huff he hung up on me 
 a while later he called me back and told me that they claimed to have mailed the check the day before and he should be expecting it anytime 
 apparently this was not good enough for him and he wanted his check that day and started to get belligerent on the phone 
 at this point i got another manager into the office and put him on speakerphone so that they could hear 
 after a while he informed me that if he did n't have his paycheck by the end of the day that he would be coming to the restaurant to get his money by force and would be suing me personally for not providing his compensation within the legal <unk> 
 i politely asked him when he considered end of business for the day and when we should expect him 
 after he hung up the phone i called the police and informed them of the situation 
 promptly at the specified time the first time he had been on time for anything related to his job he arrived with a baseball bat and demanded his money 
 the police who were sitting in the dining room stood up and arrested him for assault 
 i do n't know what he expected to get out of me seeing as i had no authority to give him money from the safe or registers and was not liable legally for the situation at all 
 the funny thing is that his mail was delayed that day and according to his female ... person his check arrived 2 hours after he got arrested 
 i pressed charges and since he had a record he went away for several years 
 he should be able to go cash that check here in about a year and a half 
 too bad he will need to call payroll to get them to reissue it because they cancel the checks after 90 <unk> power was out at out store 
 apparently the construction crew <unk> part of the theater attached to our mall <unk> when they should have <unk> and took out one of those huge fuses that are about the size of a toilet paper tube 
 everything on our side of the mall was out although we still had a trickle of voltage 
 i 'm not sure why but our <unk> lights were on at about <unk> % of their normal voltage and our clock radios were all flashing midnight at about a third of their normal <unk> and speed 
 as a result we kept the gate down and locked for the better part of the morning 
 i was thoroughly enjoying <unk> was a break in the day to day routine 
 to keep myself occupied and to make the most of the down time i started checking in a shipment by flashlight 
 suddenly clueless lady comes walking up to the gate 
 she stops for a second and then <unk> to lift the locked <unk> 
 & gt me : ma'am we 're closed 
 & gt cl : but the sign says your hours are 9am to 8pm ... and it 's 11:30 
 & gt me : yeah unfortunately the power is out and we ca n't open the store 
 & gt cl : well how long is the power gon na be out for 
 & gt me : i 'm really not sure ... that 's up to the power company 
 they 're working on it right now 
 & gt cl : so when are you gon na be open 
 & gt me : <unk> sigh* as soon as the power comes back on 
 & gt cl : when is that gon na be 
 & gt me : *blank stare ... oh you were serious 
 * ... what i actually said was : i really do n't know this is a unique situation beyond our control 
 & gt cl : well *since you 're not doing anything* can you grab the things on this list for me 
 *since i 'm not -- - okay ... 
 sure 
 * i put down the <unk> step over the piles of merchandise i had actively been sorting out and walk over to the *closed* gate and politely take her list 
 & gt me : okay let 's see what we 've got here ... i then go around the store picking out the items on her list by flashlight 
 i put them all on the counter and walk back to hand her her list 
 & gt me : there we go ... cl tries to hand me her credit card through the *closed* gate 
 & gt me : ... & gt cl : ... & gt me : ... i finally look at the card and back to her 
 & gt me : was there something else 
 & gt cl : no just take my card and check me out 
 & gt me : ... & gt cl : ... i look over my shoulder into the dark store and back to her 
 & gt me : how do you think i 'm gon na do that 
 with the power out and all 
 & gt cl : so the registers are n't working 
 & gt me : ... & gt cl : how long before the lights come back on 
 & gt me : i 'm really not sure ma'am 
 that 's up to the power company 
 & gt cl : so when can i get my stuff 
 & gt me : as soon as we open 
 & gt cl : and when will that be 
 *oh dear god just kill me now ... * my manager who had been listening to the last three or so minutes of the modern who 's on first '' routine finally called me into the back room to get me away from her 
 she stood out there the whole time waiting for the power to come back on and then she was put off by the fact that we would n't be open until the computers fully <unk> up 
 & gt cl : you guys really should plan better for this kind of thing 
 ... and i died a little more <unk> work for a popular <unk> cable company that is primarily located on the east coast in the promotions department 
 we handle promotional visa gift cards and assist company employees and retirees with getting their discounts 
 this call was from an older lady ol and honestly the call started out pretty decent 
 she was n't super friendly but she was n't outright mean either 
 i apologize for the length blah blah blah 
 me : thank you for choosing company this is fionna 
 could i get the number associated with the account starting with the area code first 
 ol : ... <unk> me : thank you 
 do i have permission to access your account 
 ol : ... yes 
 me : okay give me just one sec while i get everything loaded up ... aaaaaand there we go 
 what can i do for you 
 ol : yes i was wondering if you offered a senior discount 
 me : unfortunately we do not offer a senior discount 
 ol : oh okay 
 how would i go about cancelling my services 
 me : if you give me just a minute i can get you over to retention and they would be more than happy to go over your options with you 
 ol : you slow the hell down 
 now this honestly came out of nowhere and took me by complete surprise 
 i have no idea what happened 
 me : i 'm sorry 
 ol : get me a manager 
 now 
 me : ma'am i -- ol : get me a manager now 
 get me a manager 
 me : okay give me just a second and i 'll see if one is available 
 this was a saturday so there was only one supervisor and he was currently on a sup call right behind me that had been going on for over an hour so obviously he was n't going to be able to take the call 
 me : okay i 'm sorry but there is n't a supervisor currently available 
 but if you give me just a second i can get you over to retention where they ca -- ol : no 
 i want to talk about you 
 i do n't like your attitude 
 me : ma'am 
 you do n't have to call in looking for a <unk> 
 i 'm honestly trying my best to help you out here 
 ol : what is your name 
 where are you 
 me : my name is fionna 
 ol : and what office are you located in 
 me : i 'm in the promotions department 
 ol : what office are you in 
 in which city 
 state 
 me : ma'am i 'm not telling you what city i 'm in 
 ol : what state are you in 
 me : i 'm in state name here 
 ol : i 'll find you 
 i ca n't explain how she said that to me 
 it sounded so <unk> and i immediately took it as a threat which also made it so i was allowed to release the call 
 yay 
 me : alright well thank you for choosing company and you have a great day 
 ol : what is your employee id 
 at this point i had already put her on mute so she sat there for a good 15 seconds before saying i think she hung up '' waiting 15 more seconds and then hanging up 
 i emailed our quality guy and asked him to listen to that call and he came up to me today to say he had to listen to it three times 
 the first time was to listen to it the second time was because i guess he did n't believe he heard what he just heard and the third time was for entertainment 
 and all day today every time we would walk by each other he would whisper i 'll find you '' 
 tl dr <unk> got into the call center and covered the whole area with poop.while i 'm on my 15 ... why not 
 man comes up to return 10 items 
 i ask for id since he has no receipt and red flag number one appears 
 c : here i 'll read it to you 
 m : got to see it sir 
 hands me the card and says as i type : c : that number 9 is actually an 8. it got washed off 
 i play along 
 me : oh 
 okay 
 i still input numbers as is how i can read it 
 up pops an error as this specific dl number has done too many returns <unk> receipts and after <unk> the limit the system stops you 
 i tell him this 
 c : see 
 that 's why i told you that it was an 8. not a 9. m : i 'll get my manager 
 c : fine 
 he motions my <unk> and asks her opinion on the number 
 c : it looks like an 8 right 
 cw : no 
 that 's a 9. c : pfft 
 whatever 
 can i have another bag so i can leave 
 m : one moment sir 
 c : my wife will come back with the receipt 
 m : awesome 
 have a nice day 
 i 've never heard of numbers washing off a license 
 have y'all 
 he was calm for the most part but he was another sketchy fellow.i work in a book store part time and today i had a really wonderful encounter 
 an older lady came up to cash with a magazine ready to buy it 
 she was really excited talking about how she really loves the designs in the magazine and even showed me a few 
 when i rang the magazine up it wound up being a little bit more due to a recent price increase 
 she became very <unk> and looked through the magazine and sadly decided it was n't worth the extra cost it went up from around $ 12 to $ 16 
 she left the magazine behind and left the store 
 a woman and her daughter were next in line and overheard part of the conversation 
 they put their purchases on the desk and as they were getting ready to pay the daughter asked about the magazine the lady had left behind 
 she wanted to add it to her transaction and catch up to the lady so she could give it to her 
 the daughter left the money on the counter and ran out the door trying to catch up to the lady 
 i finished up the transaction and started cashing out the next transaction when she returned 
 i 'm happy to say that the daughter did manage to catch up to the older lady and the lady looked super happy to have the magazine 
 it 's really nice seeing people take an interest in other people 's lives in a positive <unk> this story happened the other day but i was actually a customer in this situation 
 i 'm on mobile so sorry for formatting 
 anyway my boyfriend and i were checking out with a younger cashier about my age and we were joking around as she rang up my items 
 suddenly a middle aged woman stomps up 
 lady : excuse me every time i come here i get a cart and leave it aside while i go to the bathroom and every time i come out it 's gone 
 cashier : sorry someone probably saw it and put it away because people leave their carts around all the time 
 lady : well you should go get it for me 
 the cashier is halfway through my transaction and looks perplexed 
 i became very bothered as this lady is now interrupting my transaction for this 
 the cashier looks <unk> over at the closest bagger an elderly woman 
 cashier : could you please get this lady a cart 
 the old woman <unk> off 
 mind you the carts are like not fifteen feet away to the right 
 anyway it takes ten seconds for the bagger to retrieve the cart 
 meanwhile the bitchy lady is tapping her foot looking smug 
 boyfriend and i begin rolling our eyes and telling the cashier we are sorry 
 when she gets her cart the lady then leaves us going in the very direction the carts are 
 the lady literally passes the carts by 
 the three of us <unk> she was going that way anyway '' 
 she just wanted an excuse to bitch and order people around 
 i mean if it 's a problem why does she have to get a cart before going to the bathroom 
 ca n't she wait until she 's done before getting one 
 ca n't she go pee before she goes shopping 
 no because that implies she is a thinking and rational creature 
 it 's annoying when carts pile up because people dump them 
 she just complained that the employees were doing their jobs well 
 i had to stop my boyfriend from angrily approaching her because i did n't want it to escalate but we made sure to make fun of her loud enough for her to hear 
 as i mentioned in another post i used to work in a big bookstore 
 at the time this story happened i had worked my way up from inventory clerk to cafe supervisor 
 most retail workers are used to <unk> who leave their small children to run free in their stores without <unk> while mommy or daddy go out and do whatever 
 in our store when we noticed this happening we usually gave it about two hours before we called the cops to track down the parents 
 on this day the two kids running around our store were being particularly obnoxious 
 they were running behind the register knocking over displays and generally being a nuisance 
 so the only good manager and i went over where they were picking books off of a classics display and throwing them on the floor and asked where their parents were 
 & gt **horrible child 1** mommy 's getting her hair and nails done 
 & gt **me** when is she coming back 
 & gt **horrible child 2** i dunno she said might take like four hours 
 & gt **manager** ok you guys want to hang out with <unk> in the cafe while i see if i can find your mom 
 & gt **horrible <unk> <unk> 
 this was a sign that manager was about to call the cops and it was my job to keep the kids busy 
 i herded them over to the cafe where i had one of my <unk> whip up two <unk> <unk> ice cream drinks and warm up two <unk> 
 the kids continued their wild <unk> at my desk while they got increasingly <unk> on sugar and coffee 
 the cops beat the mom to our store by about ten minutes so she got slapped with a fine for negligence 
 she also got to take home two obnoxious children who were so wound up they probably could have shot themselves into space 
 it 's so <unk> to be a good samaritan 
 <unk> for all of you worried about their little hearts on caffeine the kids were like 10 and 12. the single shot of espresso in their drinks would be about equal to a can of soda 
 i 'm guessing that a mom who plans to leave her kids unattended for 4 hours is n't too picky about their food habits.as the title suggests i work in an ice cream shop 
 one of my more important tasks is to make sure no one steals anything on the floor while serving a multitude of customers 
 in walks this group of middle school boys 
 they 're loud and i immediately peg them as the ask for 400 samples and walk away '' type 
 sure enough all of them ask for samples but then they start ordering 
 they all pick some of the most expensive things on our menu and add a few toppings each 
 this is setting off red flags because i 've seen this group before and they always ask for samples and never get anything 
 as the boys move down the line i 'm keeping an eye on the whole group ready to vault over the counter and chase them down if they decide to dine and <unk> 
 well i did n't have to 
 the last boy that i served payed for the whole group 
 he had gotten some money for his birthday and decided to take out his friends for ice cream 
 gave me the warm <unk> and made me feel like a <unk> jerk at the same <unk> the checkouts for a retail store in new zealand 
 credit cards here have now evolved to mostly chip paywave that 's where you do n't swipe or insert the card at all merely wave it over the terminal and the sale automatically <unk> with no pin required on purchases less than $ 80 
 at the checkouts and an old man comes forward to buy some shoes 
 as you sometimes get the man flicks his card at me to put through i do n't know why people do this when the credit card terminal is right by their face 
 so in the interests of clearing the queue and just being efficient i grab the card and <unk> it over as a paywave 
 i give the customer his receipt and wish him a good day 
 customer suddenly gets rather upset claiming the money has been stolen etc 
 i offer to return the shoes and then they can buy them again if they wish to try and <unk> the situation 
 so this is how it <unk> : * return shoes - customer charges their money back into the cheque account that it came from * charge customer for shoes again - customer inserts their chip and charges their cheque account as i 'm getting them to sign the slip confirming the return they notice that the money was withdrawn returned and then withdrawn again from the same account 
 what was the point of that '' 
 they ask 
 you tell me.i used to work for this company that was super strict about how their stores looked and they prided themselves at having arguably some of the best warranty in the business 
 i was at the counter working for the task team that is known as no not saying 
 : d anyways i was at the counter when this guy shows up and wants to do a return 
 normally i do n't take care of returns as that is customer service but seeing how we are in the same area sometimes they get confused but i decide to help the guy out anyways as the line was long and i was nice that way 
 me : how can i help you today 
 grumpy grandpa gg : i need to do a return 
 me : normally returns are done in customer service but i will make an exception and do the return here 
 gg : ok me : ok now lets take a look here what did you bring in today 
 - guy puts down some software in an already opened box 
 me : oh i 'm sorry sir but we ca n't return this 
 i can only exchange it for another of the same title 
 gg : no you will return this 
 i want my money back now 
 me : firstly sir there is no need to get worked up the receipt states that once opened software can not be returned secondly please be more calm or i will call loss prevention over 
 gg : no you will do your job and give me my money back 
 they promised me this would clean up my viruses and it did n't 
 give me my money back now 
 me : sir i 'm going to have to let you know now that i ca n't do anything about it 
 even if i were to allow the return the system will not allow it and will only let me give you an exchange 
 i ca n't even give you store credit for this 
 gg : get me your manager now 
 - cue manager and me telling him what went down manager : what seems to be the problem 
 gg : your employee was being rude to me and telling me that i should go f**k myself 
 he 's being racist 
 manager : firstly sir i know that what you are telling me did n't happen as i was just in the other isle listening in on the conversation and what my employee told you and what he told me match up and is correct 
 once you open software we can only exchange it for another copy of the same name 
 - cue an ensuing argument and manager making an exception 
 gg : see i told you that you were going to give me my money back 
 me : actually no you told me that i was going to give you your money back 
 i did n't give you anything that was my manager that authorized the return not me 
 he had gotten upset and left the store vowing never to return to which i called out see you tomorrow 
 sure enough like always i see him the next day in the other dept and as i soon as i go up to assist another customer near him i see him dart for another dept out of sheer embarrassment 
 another tale from the travel agent with a creepy captain 
 so a few years ago i was given the responsibility of training several new staff members unofficially and without any support time or <unk> of course and as a result had to keep an eye on all customer interactions with the new agents as our job is pretty info heavy 
 in comes the <unk> lady yms lady for short 
 yms lady has booked her flights online with another company in another state 
 yms lady has selected for her tickets to be sms 'd to her mobile 
 yms lady has decided that our job is to be an information service and has come to us for us to do her online <unk> for her 
 my new agent let 's call her kelly tries to <unk> explain that it 's not our job that we did n't do the booking and that she has to do it herself 
 getting nowhere she decides to give in and do the online check in for this lady 
 except she does n't know how and calls me over 
 all good i come over and start showing her 
 yms lady starts making sarcastic comments to her friend about how we do n't know how to do something as simple as our jobs and that it should n't take two people to do something so simple 
 we ignore her and check her in 
 here 's where the fun begins - because yms lady has previously selected mobile itinerary it has <unk> to the same method 
 this is not a system we use and we are only familiar with it from our own travel 
 yms lady wants her boarding pass printed - but we ca n't because she 's already checked in and we ca n't bring it back up now 
 yms lady is screaming at the two of us calling us lazy and incompetent 
 she is threatening to sue us get us fired never book here again which she never had in the first place and stands up to loom over us <unk> 
 my customer service smile has dropped from my face and i 'm responding as little as possible 
 me : yms there 's nothing else we can do 
 this is something that we have tried to do as a <unk> for you and i ca n't help you any further '' 
 yms : do n't give me that snotty shit 
 stop being so <unk> and bitchy and do your f @ $ ing job '' 
 me : if you continue to yell at us like this i will have to ask you to leave '' 
 yms : you can try bitch 
 look at you you snooty cow 
 your head is so far up your ass you should be inside out '' 
 me : please leave otherwise i will be forced to call security '' 
 yms : you can bloody well try - i 've been thrown out of worse places than this '' 
 i 'm sure she has this is the point that i lost my temper somewhere in her rambling yelling as she slammed her hands on the counter and made a motion to hit me 
 me : if you touch a single hair on my head i will call the police on you 
 now get the hell out of my store '' 
 <unk> how dare you speak to me like that 
 you 're so fired '' 
 me : yeah well i 'm not too worried 
 i 've never had a complaint before and i 'm sure they 'd know better than to listen to a crazy person like you that is not even a customer '' 
 with that i grabbed kelly and we walked into the back room 
 yms screamed threw some last parting words knocked all of the stationery off our desks and stormed off with her <unk> silent friend in tow 
 told boss who laughed and bought us coffees to recover from the stress 
 kelly and i snuck away called the <unk> pretended to be her and cancelled her flight 
 tl : dr it was non-refundable 
 so since my first two post went well here 's a third one 
 like in my last story i worked at a <unk> shop in the older part of my city 
 on this day i had a female customer come in 
 she was about 5 '' 2 brunette and a <unk> figure 
 lets call her hf 
 i being the sells man i am automatically ask if she needs and help 
 she says no and looks around the store 
 when another customer comes in 
 this customer is a guy whom i usually do n't do my <unk> to since they always just ignore me 
 well he notices hf and try 's on some glasses next to her 
 when he try 's on the most expensive pair in the rack in front of him hf tells him that they look great on him 
 also that he should buy them 
 so he comes up to the register and pays for them 
 then he tries to talk to hf who started talking up another pair of shades to another female 
 hf ended up talking 15 people into buying expensive shades that day 
 at the end of it all she <unk> up to me and asked if that counted as a live interview 
 then leaves her info and goes in with her day 
 tr dl customer comes in and sells the product for me and ends up getting a job 
 i worked at a big box warehouse type store a few years back and it 's one of those stores that have branded credit cards with the person 's face on it 
 it always baffled me that customers would write check id '' or see driver 's license '' on the back of them but as i was supposed to do whenever someone put that on their card i would ask for their actual id 
 most people would say why 
 my picture 's right there '' 
 i know but you wrote 'check dl in all caps where your signature should be so i am obligated to ask '' 
 from this point one of two things would happen : 1 they 'd show me their id apologetically and feeling a little stupid 2 they 'd continue to call me stupid or act like i was a <unk> while showing me their id 
 in my earlier posts i mentioned that this store was in a higher income neighborhood so we had a lot of people in their golf attire come in 
 one such fellow did 
 polo shirt tucked into his khakis white <unk> <unk> hair and a <unk> 
 he was a portly fellow possibly from eating too much wine and cheese 
 at this point in my career i 'm sick of the job and my <unk> levels are at record lows 
 he clearly wrote check driver 's license '' on the card with his photo on it so before i charged it i asked for it 
 that 's me '' 
 yes i know it 's you but since you wrote to check your license i have to ask '' 
 that 's fucking stupid 
 i 'm not taking out my id '' 
 i 'm not charging the card then '' 
 you little shit do you know who i am 
 i 'm not taking out my id '' 
 i have no idea who you are because you wont show me your id '' 
 the line is long as all hell because it 's one of those stores and it 's a weekend and it 's coupon time 
 well i 'm not leaving until you ring me up '' this asshole says 
 at this point i give him back his card 
 alright then 
 ring yourself up '' i said locked my register and walked away 
 some supervisor finished his order while i ate a snickers bar in the breakroom and watched whatever was on the tv 
 i did n't get into any trouble because the customers after him told the supervisor what a dick the guy was 
 everyone talked about doing that one day and i actually did 
 i worked there for 2 more years after <unk> up on self respect that day 
 hi everyone 
 you all are so sweet so i thought i would share another retail story that involves a <unk> vendor as opposed to a customer 
 as you guys know i own a small business where i hand make items and also have some re-sell items 
 i set up a booth at events and sell that way 
 for whatever reason vendors are angry territorial people 
 not all of them but a larger majority than seems reasonable 
 i am the jane <unk> in a world full of multiple versions of a very pregnant petra <unk> - all angry 
 one rainy october morning two falls back i was setting up at an outdoor dog event 
 things were going slowly because it was super early in the morning and i 'm a horrible morning person and the rain was keeping myself and my <unk> from being able to fully walk outside of the tent and set up from both sides of the table 
 we were n't in fear of the rain because we were the wicked witch of the west but because it was about 45 degrees out and neither one of us wanted to freeze our buns off for the next eight hours just because we were stupid enough to go stand in the rain to set up 
 my partner and i had our heads down and were working on taking things out of the boxes and setting them up on the tables 
 we were n't paying as much attention to our vendor space as we normally would because the event was blocked off to customers for another hour and a half so all that surrounded us were vendors most which i knew from other dog events 
 we travel in packs 
 pun intended 
 i happened to look up to where i had my dog tutus hanging on the one rack inside the tent and see a large heavily tattooed man with multiple holes in his clothes who was not at all dressed for the weather pulling at my one tutu effectively taking it apart 
 i was slow to understand at first but when the realization came upon me that this guy was a vendor that apparently had nothing better to do than come pick apart my items it got hairy 
 i will be me and he will be j for jerk 
 & gt me : excuse me can i help you with something '' 
 & gt j : i want to see how you make your tutus 
 we want to make them and ca n't figure out how '' 
 <unk> to physically pull apart my tutu* & gt me : that 's fine but you ca n't tear apart my product just so you can learn how to make something 
 you ca n't be in my booth either 
 we are still setting up and closed as i imagine you are as well since we have quite awhile until the start of the event 
 please put the tutu down and leave 
 you 're not welcome to come back and look at it later 
 please figure out how to make them on your own like i did '' 
 & gt j : well i 've already got it halfway apart 
 i 'm going to take this over to my wife and show her how you did these '' 
 as i mentioned this guy was large but there was no way in the world he was going to continue to ruin something i so <unk> made and leave the tent with it 
 there were security guards everywhere so i flew out of my tent and grabbed a security guard 
 i quickly explained that another vendor was destroying one of my items and trying to leave my booth with it 
 security stopped the guy halfway out of my booth took the tutu off of him and let him know that he could stay set up that day since he was already setting up but was n't welcomed back 
 he also was n't allowed anywhere near my booth 
 i ran into the <unk> at two other events - neither of which they are allowed back to 
 during the one they were set up across from me 
 they continued to <unk> on another woman 's booth continually moving their stuff over until they blocked it 
 they were asked to pack up early 
 at the other event we were supposed to set up beside them and i very politely told the person running it about the issue we had with them previously 
 they moved us down and swapped us spaces with the <unk> society thinking that they would n't harass an animal shelter 
 wrong 
 they 've basically been <unk> at vendor shows in our area to the point where they 're kind of their own legend 
 apparently they harass people everywhere they go and everyone knows who they are because of their appearance 
 they always wear ratty and torn clothes act <unk> and drop constant f <unk> and other language inappropriate for family events and chain smoke the whole way through an event 
 i 'm hoping to avoid them forever 
 tl dr - vendor tries to tear apart my dog tutu so he can learn how to make them himself and was escorted from my booth by security and banned from coming back 
 i find out this is typical behavior for this vendor 
 hello again it 's been a while 
 this story is about one of my colleagues and happened a week or two ago 
 my co-worker j '' was serving a customer at the front counter and i was standing a meter or so away minding my own business when ... & gt oh my gosh ... i hit the wrong button 
 help ... manager 
 manager '' 
 of course the manager came running to investigate what <unk> situation had just unfolded 
 & gt i was putting the change into the computer so that it would tell me how much i had to give back and i put too much in 
 she gave me $ 20 but i told the computer it was $ 15 
 help '' 
 again i was standing just meters away and i could n't help but listen in 
 no worries though it 's obviously a simple problem and manager will know how to fix it 
 ... nope 
 & gt manager : ah get me a calculator '' manager proceeded to <unk> buttons into the calculator furiously as though this was a complex <unk> that needed serious thought 
 by this stage i 'm getting concerned for the reputation of our *international* company i mean ... one staff member struggling to do maths with numbers below 20 is bad enough but the manager as well 
 i looked on the screen and saw that the customers items came to $ 12 and j had entered $ 15 thus needing $ 3 change 
 if the customer had <unk> given $ 20 to j then she simply needed to grab an extra $ 5 out of the til 
 problem <unk> 
 in my most nonchalant tone i quietly said & gt '' well she just needs an extra $ 5 ... 
 no '' 
 manager pushed a few <unk> keys on the calculator to confirm '' i suppose 
 & gt manager : well yes of course 
 simple 
 j give the lady an extra $ 5 '' 
 so frustrating 
 i work at an official hockey team merch store in an arena 
 we wear black long sleeve <unk> shirts 
 some guy referred to as <unk> '' or pd '' was upset that we do n't sell our uniform shirts 
 the conversation went a bit like this : & gt pd : where 'd you get that shirt 
 & gt me : it 's the employee uniform sir 
 & gt pd : where do i buy it 
 & gt me : you do n't 
 & gt pd : that 's ridiculous 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry sir 
 we have some similar polos if <unk> & gt pd : this is ridiculous 
 where is your manager 
 you idiots should not be wearing things you do n't sell 
 okay bro ... i work for a rental car company at an international airport 
 i was having a pretty routine day working outside in the parking garage in our kiosk when a young woman popped up at my window - i did n't even see her approach 
 i slid the window open and before i could even greet her she slapped some paperwork down on the counter in front of me and went off 
 i 'm here to get a different car the one you gave us has insert laundry list of <unk> here and we want a discount because of the inconvenience of having to drive all the way back here to take care of this and ... '' etc etc 
 i was trying to cut in at any opportunity but she would n't let up for probably two or three minutes 
 when she finally stopped talking i told her i 'm not going to be able to help you ... '' <unk> she butt in i 'm supposed to talk to some guy 's name i 've never heard of where is he '' 
 i told her i 'm not sure who that is but he probably works for rental company shown on the paperwork '' 
 just then the guy she was traveling with showed up behind her and said to her that 's not who we rented from '' and pointed to another kiosk nearby 
 she took a step back looked up to actually read the sign on the <unk> then snatched up her paperwork and turned away to go to the correct kiosk 
 yes our colors are similar but it 's the words on signs that matter right 
 mom and 4 year old daughter come through my line with just basic groceries 
 after the initial greeting and small talk the little girl looks up and asks me if she can pay for her baby 
 a little confused i look up at mom and she says her daughter 's asking if she can pay for her invisible baby 
 i giggle a little and tell the girl that i can absolutely let her do that 
 so i have her come around the counter invisible baby in her arms and scan '' the baby over the register 
 she squeals with delight and runs back around the counter to mom 
 her mom laughed and said thanks saying that most people just smile but never play along with her imagination 
 then the girl asks if she can have a bag to put her baby in 
 not wanting to give a small child a plastic bag i pulled out a paper bag that has handles and her whole face just lit up 
 she had the biggest grin as she put her invisible baby into the bag and held on to it tight 
 mom was smiling and told me i just made the girls day and she just knows she 's gon na carry that bag around for at least a week 
 if she can love the small things so can i so needless to say that five minute encounter put a smile on my face for the rest of the night 
 customers ... <unk> 
 so this particular person has an appointment at <unk> to see the doctor 
 we call her the day before to confirm she is coming and she says she will be 
 at the time of the appointment she does n't turn up 
 we called her at <unk> to see if she 's stuck in traffic or something and if we should hold on a little longer 
 there 's no answer 
 so the doctor starts seeing other patients 
 at <unk> the patient turns up and just says oh sorry i 'm a little late i was caught up in work i 'm here now though so let the doctor know i 'm ready to see him '' 
 really 
 not even a real apology and why did you turn up three hours late and not even inform us 
 i said well the doctor has taken other patients and he is really tightly booked today and he has a surgery at 5:30pm to prepare for i really do n't think there 's a chance to see him today 
 i will however let him know you 're here since you 're just here to review your test results and it might not take a long time '' yeah whatever ill just sit here then '' i checked with the doctor and informed her 
 ok he is willing to see you but there may be a long waiting time he has to attended the other patients first and only if he finishes a bit early you can have ten minutes to see him '' skip forward 7 minutes 
 patient : seriously 
 is this the sort of service you offer 
 i 've been waiting now for 35 minutes to see the doctor 
 this is unprofessional i 'm a patient and deserve proper treatment '' i 'm sorry for the wait but you turned up very late and completely missed your appointment 
 the doctor might be able to squeeze you in but he must see his other patients who had appointments '' she argues back my supervisor gets involved and i have an incident report written against me regarding the way i <unk> patients away bitch hey guys first post ever on reddit 
 whoop whoop 
 longtime lurker though 
 i have worked at a grocery chain for a while now and we have <unk> through many managers though our current manager is a little insane she once smiled and me and a customer and then we walked into the back and she started screaming and throwing bottles of alcohol all over the stocking area because it was <unk> '' i have a book i 'll put up here one day on her '' anywho i am one of the few people in our store who has experience working in the fuel center 
 its a <unk> box you stand in hating your life 
 it has no restroom this is important 
 i 'm doing uscan and bouncing to a cash register and trying to keep people from all going to one line etc ... i get a call on my little wireless phone from the fuel center that the new girl had the screen freeze up on her 
 this happens often since the computer out there is about <unk> years old 
 so i go out and fix it but notice her acting a little funny kinda faint and sluggish 
 so i ask her if shes fine and shes like i got here at 2:00 and i have n't had a break to eat or go to the bathroom '' i gave her this look of wtf apparently no one notified us that the front end needed to do her break today usually they work it out that people come early or stay late so the person out there gets their breaks and it was 8:30pm i phoned in to the front and said i was giving her her lunch and they 'll have to handle the front until after that 
 i do n't know how a high school aged pregnant girl survived out there for 6 hours without a stop 
 i made a new sheet that i schedule their breaks with ours to ensure they all get their breaks now seriously these people that forget about us <unk> ... .this happened in my days of fast food servitude 
 about two months after i started we had a guy show up asking if he could do some work outside for us in exchange for a meal 
 now we all hated the outside jobs so my manager gave him the <unk> 
 minimum wage is <unk> and one of our meals is around $ 7 so he gave him a few tasks and told him for one hour of work he could have a meal 
 so this guy picked up cigarette butts pulled weeds and swept the lot for an hour 
 after that he came in are his meal thanked everyone working shook my manager 's hand and left 
 he came back the next weekend and asked the same thing and my manager agreed again 
 this went on for about 6 months every weekend 
 about 3 weeks into this routine the time he comes in is about halfway through my shift and he seems like a nice genuine dude so i take my break and eat with him 
 we chat a bit and i make this a weekly thing taking my break to eat with him every one he comes in 
 i gradually learn his story 
 he 's in his mid-40s used to own a good sized landscaping company with 6 crews that went around doing mostly <unk> jobs but also doing private jobs occasionally 
 his wife was killed in a traffic accident in <unk> when they were both around <unk> he did n't feel right dating again after that so he was still single years later 
 they did n't have kids so his company was all he had and he completely <unk> himself in it 
 however with the crash in '08 his company slowly went under 
 he had to sell off his trucks and lay off his crews one by one until it was just a single truck with himself and a couple guys who had been with him for 10 years 
 finally he had to sell that truck too and he fell into a really bad <unk> 
 with his wife gone no family and no company he lost all his drive 
 he lost his house and car and began living in the streets trying his luck as a day laborer 
 there are a lot of hispanic <unk> in the area who worked for a lot less though so he rarely got work 
 anyway he kept this up for a few months eventually starting to come in 3 or 4 days a week 
 i left the store early this year and he was still there and a month after i left so did our maintenance guy 
 my manager ended up hiring the guy full time on maintenance and he really got his shit together 
 last i heard he was preparing to move into a new apartment his first home in 6 years 
 tl dr : homeless guy asks to work for food ends up being hired full time got his life back together 
 i work at a more expensive clothing retailer 
 we sell more business type clothing along with casual clothing 
 as a result our casual clothing can get a bit pricey 
 so earlier this week we had three customers walk in 
 i 'm assuming it was a woman with her husband and her sister 
 so they 're going around our store looking at the casual clothing 
 now keep in mind that these customers are regulars and shop here frequently so they know our policies by heart 
 they ask a bunch of our staff for help specifically for help with the woman 's denim shorts 
 they keep asking if it 's bogo free and there 's clearly a sign right on the table saying bogo $ 19.90 
 so of course we say no and inform them of the correct deal 
 they do this to every associate and expect a different answer 
 nope 
 same answer 
 they try everything on and come to the register and my coworker cw rings them up 
 this is what i hear : cw : find everything okay '' 
 woman the wife : everything was fine but i need to get my total under $ 150 
 i only have $ 150 on me '' 
 cw : okay we 'll see where the price comes too but just by looking at everything you have i think you 'll be over '' 
 *cw rings everything up and sure enough it 's around $ <unk> woman : is that before or after the sale '' 
 cw : excuse me '' 
 woman : there 's a sale going on right 
 everything is 40 % off '' 
 cw : i 'm sorry but that sale ended three weeks ago '' 
 woman : oh but the shorts rang up as buy one get one free right '' 
 cw : no miss they are buy one get one $ 19.90 
 you asked me this same question 10 minutes ago and they are n't bogo free '' 
 woman : but i talked to manager 's name and he said it was buy one get one free '' 
 *cw starts getting <unk> cw : oh really 
 because manager 's name is n't even in 
 he has n't been here all day '' 
 woman : oh well someone told me ... '' cw : ma'am i ca n't change the price because you want me to 
 even if an associate accidentally stated the wrong deal i can not alter the price due to one small error '' 
 woman : i need the price to be under $ 150 
 ca n't you just help me out '' 
 cw : if you have coupons that have n't expired then sure we can help you that way '' 
 woman : what about $ 25 off of every specific amount spent 
 here i have it on my phone '' 
 cw : that expired three days ago and i ca n't override expired coupons 
 that 's just how our system works '' 
 woman : but i need it under $ 150 
 ca n't you just reduce the price for me '' 
 cw : nope 
 i 'm not allowed to and i wo n't get fired because you do n't have enough money '' 
 woman : but i <unk> it under $ 150 '' 
 cw : i 'm sorry i ca n't do anything 
 i ca n't offer you 15 % off by signing up for our charge card because i know you have one 
 but i know how you can get it under $ 150 '' 
 woman : how '' 
 cw : by not buying everything '' 
 i do n't know why but i started laughing and had to cover my mouth to prevent myself from laughing out loud 
 she ended up taking off a lot of small items to get her total under $ 150 
 why she did n't ask her husband or sister for some money i do n't know why 
 she could have paid them back
