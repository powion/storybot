 people are weird 
 edit : wow 
 i did n't expect my post to get this much attention 
 thanks for reading and <unk> everyone ok guys not my first tfr but my first one for my new job 
 here goes 
 about three weeks ago i started at a large <unk> company in their customer service <unk> 
 a girl whom we shall call <unk> started the week before me but left for a holiday bad <unk> on new jobs came back and we 're both on the counter doing <unk> <unk> bill payments etc 
 i 've gotten the general hang of everything 
 today a woman came into the store while i was <unk> a customer and <unk> called her over very politely and professionally her response was i 'll wait for one of the men to serve me '' 
 <unk> you did not just say that 
 so she waits for me and asks for a <unk> and i reply with sorry i 'm new here '' holding up my trainee badge and turn to <unk> and said how do you process a top up voucher again '' 
 <unk> walks me through the steps and i stuff up a few times and then the woman asks for me to put it onto a <unk> device before i finish the transaction 
 *note : we finish the transaction first otherwise we do n't have the voucher code 
 * <unk> tells her that i need to finish the transaction first and i start stammering and asking how to do that 
 this caused the woman to freak out and ask for someone else so <unk> came over and ran the transaction through she asked if she could get <unk> elsewhere and it she could do it at home and left 
 later i went on break and she was still in the shopping centre and refused to make eye contact with me 
 and the best part : she came back later not knowing how to activate it herself and she saw me working with a customer like normal doing the exact same thing she wanted 
 take that you rude cow 
 tl dr : woman refused to be served by woman had to deal with incompetent '' me 
 edit : oh 
 oh 
 oh 
 i remember when she came back i <unk> in on her on the security camera and the assistant manager said she 's been in the store and acted like a cow to the staff before 
 i work at a <unk> that sells cigarettes usually on the front counter where said cigarettes are 
 i have to card anyone i think looks under 40 as is typical of most places 
 i get a number of young people who sigh <unk> or complain that they never get <unk> anywhere else but it 's typically not that bad 
 except for this one woman 
 i have a line at my register and this woman comes up next in it 
 looks maybe in her early 20s 
 she asks for a pack of <unk> so i pull one off the rack behind me and ask to see her id 
 she briefly looks in her purse 
 & gt her : i left it at home 
 ca n't you just take my birthday and put it in 
 & gt me : no i ca n't do that 
 i have to see an id 
 & gt her : what 
 but that one black girl the manager always just puts in my birthday 
 i come here all the time and it 's fine 
 i know exactly who she 's talking about but i have no idea who this woman is 
 never seen her before in my life 
 & gt me : well she 's not a manager and she 's certainly not supposed to be doing that 
 i wo n't be doing it either 
 you 're welcome to come back with your id 
 i put the cigarettes back on the rack and go to move on to the next customer 
 & gt her : this is ridiculous 
 i am <unk> years old i should be allowed to buy my damn cigarettes 
 & gt me : sorry i ca n't sell them to you 
 like i said if you come back with a valid id i will be more than happy to sell them to you 
 she walks a bit away and i resume going through my line 
 then she approaches a man in the back of the line who is clearly old enough to buy tobacco with <unk> hair and <unk> 
 & gt her rather loudly : hey man here 's 5 bucks buy me a pack of camel crush 
 i pause in ringing up my customer 
 & gt me : m'am i ca n't sell to him now either because i know he 's buying them for someone whose age i ca n't verify 
 & gt her : what the hell 
 this is ridiculous 
 go ask any of the other employees here they 'll recognize me and tell you how old i am 
 and even if you do n't know how old i am he believes me you can sell to him he 's clearly old enough 
 & gt me : you 're welcome to go ask them if they 'll sell to you 
 i wo n't 
 i do n't know you i have no reason to believe you when you say how old you are and i wo n't get in trouble for selling to you just because you say i should 
 & gt her : yeah but you 're not selling to me you 're selling to him 
 & gt me : yes but i heard you ask him to buy them for you 
 in the eyes of our company and the law it 's the same as if i sold them directly to you 
 & gt her : that 's just <unk> 
 what do you even know 
 & gt me : i do n't make the rules i just follow them 
 she starts to get very <unk> here acting like she 's going to die without her cigarettes and how i a child ca n't tell her <unk> year old self what to do 
 she 's throwing a fit in front of my register and the other customers are staring and starting to get impatient in the line 
 she even goes so far as to try and shove a picture in my face of her child as if a picture of some child i do n't know <unk> she 's as old as she says she is 
 i get fed up and call for a manager over the <unk> the manager on duty calls the register and asks what i need and i tell him that a woman is very upset that i wo n't sell her cigarettes 
 & gt her : i am not upset 
 sure you are n't 
 my manager says he 'll be right there 
 she is n't willing to wait around and storms out before he even gets there 
 presumably to try the same thing at the gas station across the street 
 seriously though acting like a 4 year old whose mom is n't buying her the candy she wants is n't any way to prove you 're an adult 
 <unk> again 
 first story in a while that i 've <unk> worthy for this subreddit 
 my head still <unk> from hitting my desk over this one 
 **background** : i work for a *very* large <unk> in the uk in their call center working on the instant chat system for their home delivery department 
 everyone meet the customer referred to as <unk> '' : & gt ** <unk> ** hello my name is <unk> welcome to <unk> <unk> 
 how can i help you today 
 & gt ** <unk> ** hi there i was expecting my order between 6pm and 7pm but it has n't arrived 
 <unk> 
 i hate missing deliveries 
 i grab the details of the customer and chase it up for them 
 i then find out there was an issue with their payment card 
 i advise them of this ... & gt ** <unk> ** oh yeah i knew about that 
 someone from <unk> called me and told me about it 
 <unk> & gt ** <unk> ** they should 've tried to resolve it for you by taking an additional form of payment 
 ** <unk> ** oh they did but i was out at the time 
 i tried to call back but no one answered 
 ** <unk> ** i see that was a few hours ago now so unfortunately we ca n't resolve that for you tonight 
 however i can <unk> the order for delivery for tomorrow if you 'd like 
 ** <unk> ** ooh if you could please 
 will you try to charge me again tomorrow 
 ** <unk> ** yes we 'll try to take payment as your payment failed today so you were n't charged for today 
 if you have n't <unk> the issue you had today the same will probably happen tomorrow in which case we wo n't deliver 
 ** <unk> ** what 
 you wo n't deliver if you ca n't take payment 
 why the f @ # 
 not 
 ** <unk> ** we need to make sure we can take payment before we can deliver your order ... otherwise we lose money 
 ** <unk> ** this is f @ <unk> # ing ridiculous 
 transfer me to your manager now 
 ** <unk> ** certainly she 's just jumping in now 
 ** manager ** hi there i 'm <unk> 's manager 
 everything <unk> has said is true and we wo n't be delivering to you if we ca n't take a payment 
 that 's how deliveries work 
 is there anything else i can help with this evening 
 <unk> has <unk> from the chat 
 * -- - **tl dr : ** how dare you not deliver my groceries if i do n't pay for them 
 -- - next tfr <unk> previous tfr i have long since gotten out of the retail game but for a long time i worked in a variety of <unk> and <unk> stores 
 there are a quite few stories but this is one of the most unbelievable to me even now 
 at the time i was 20 had a short blonde bob wore a lot of 50 's dresses and looked like a german <unk> doll google my people so people <unk> <unk> my <unk> 
 the store i worked at was this huge place and in the middle of a really <unk> diverse area 
 it was a <unk> job but all my coworkers were amazing so it was <unk> 
 this day i was <unk> the dress section of the store and was really involved in what i was doing 
 i was about halfway done when i feel a hard tug on my hair 
 assuming that one of my coworkers is behind me i turn around with a smile ready to come up with some <unk> about <unk> 
 however who i see is not a friend it 's some 50+ woman smiling back at me 
 before i can register that a <unk> has just touched my person this woman says exactly these words i just wanted to see if it was *real* i 'm a mom '' 
 but she draws or the word mom '' like <unk> as if it is cute and she is just smiling the whole goddamn time 
 before i have time to process the fact that another human being just tried to <unk> my wig <unk> she <unk> back to who i assume to be her teenage daughters and i am left standing with her <unk> * '' i 'm a <unk> '' * causing cell death in my brain 
 almost 10 years later and this still <unk> me 
 i am <unk> thinking of things to say to <unk> checker scan <unk> 
 that 's my job at grocery store chain 
 first because it 's important to the story : i am a stubborn person who insists on having an <unk> hair color 
 it 's pink 
 yes yes it is weird and you can look at me funny all you want but it 's what i wanted 
 fortunately the store i work at has no policy against <unk> colors 
 the only thing you ca n't have is a visible tattoo 
 bible gal is a young woman probably in her early to mid 30s 
 she comes through my lane notices my hair and <unk> down to tell her daughter : it 's okay honey we 'll be out of the <unk> lady 's line soon '' 
 daughter was like 4 years old and did n't care 
 i pipe in and say is everything alright ma'am '' 
 ** '' your hair is <unk> 
 ** at this point i am flabbergasted by what i 've just heard 
 maybe if the color was red since <unk> is red right 
 but it 's pink 
 someone should have informed me of <unk> 's <unk> sooner 
 i do n't understand miss '' i respond 
 stop talking to me and get me your manager 
 i do n't want any of your <unk> or curses 
 i 'm a single mother and i have given my life to the holy spirit '' 
 she then grabs her cross <unk> and holds it up to me as if that would banish me back to the <unk> or something 
 i get her joe <unk> my manager 
 hi i 'm joe the <unk> manager 
 what can i help you with ma'am '' 
 says he 
 are you aware that you hired a <unk> <unk> 
 are you aware that this <unk> me and my daughter '' 
 i 'm sorry ma'am 
 <unk> <unk> here is one of our best workers 
 i do n't think what she does outside of work <unk> '' 
 to clarify i am not a <unk> 
 i consider myself an <unk> 
 well then this entire store is going straight to hell 
 i hope this business goes belly up 
 i will certainly be <unk> with my dollars '' replies <unk> bird 
 then she leaves without buying her things and we 're all left putting back the things in her huge grocery cart ... & gt another day at the nature centre 
 the lady who <unk> at the front desk and takes <unk> and such <unk> me over one day after a young lady and her friend come in 
 apparently they have a group and want a discount ... .. girl : hi 
 there 's a group of 12 of us here from another city 
 we were wondering if we could get a group discount for the <unk> 
 me : ah oh dear 
 i 'm really sorry but i ca n't <unk> group discounts 
 my boss has to <unk> all group <unk> ... girl : oh 
 so you ca n't give us a discount 
 me : no i 'm really sorry 
 * & lt i actually did feel bad at this point the group was big enough for a solid 20 % <unk> discount if <unk> booked ahead of time 
 they would have gotten a <unk> led nature walk out of it <unk> & gt * girl : <unk> 
 well we really want to come in for a <unk> but we 're students <unk> 
 me : i realise that but i’m not allowed to give group discounts 
 if you call today i’m sure my boss would give you a discount for tomorrow 
 girl : we’re not here tomorrow 
 me : * & lt internal sigh & gt * ok let me call my boss 
 * boss does n't <unk> * ah i do n't think she 's in the office 
 i have some coupons here though that will give each of you a dollar off your <unk> but that is the only discount i am <unk> to give 
 that would mean $ <unk> instead of $ 6 
 girl : oh well we were hoping we could get a group discount me : oh that’s too bad 
 <unk> to the centre and <unk> would work out to just $ 5 per person though 
 <unk> frowns and begins discussing this with the friend who had <unk> her inside 
 they’re speaking another language so i don’t understand 
 * girl : so you can only give us a dollar off 
 me : um yeah i can <unk> a dollar off each <unk> 
 girl : <unk> well we were kind of hoping to get the group rate 
 *note : we have no standard group rate 
 my boss <unk> groups based on how big the group is what they want out of their visit and where they’re from ex : a school gets a bigger discount than a bus <unk> group * me : sorry my boss is the only one allowed to give big discounts 
 girl : so we ca n't get a group rate 
 me : * & lt internally screaming & gt * well a dollar off per person is $ 12 off your total amount that 's pretty good & lt we go back and forth like this for several minutes 
 i 'm feeling like i want to bang my head against the wall when i have a glorious light bulb <unk> & gt me : * & lt huge sigh & gt * ok you know what 
 fine 
 if you pay in one transaction i’ll give you 15 % off 
 the girl gets a huge smile on her face and excitedly chats with her friend for a second girl : okay 
 that sounds great 
 she pays gets the discount and the group goes on the nature walk all of them happy as <unk> 
 my coworker looks at me incredulously as i 'm definitely not allowed to do what i just did 
 he then looks a bit worried as i burst out laughing after they leave 
 him : ... but we ca n't give disc ... me : ... 15 % off a $ 6 <unk> works out to $ <unk> per person 
 she just paid more than if she 'd taken my original offer 
 <unk> 
 explained the whole thing to my boss who also thought it was extremely funny 
 do n't fuck with the people who take your money folks 
 so i work at a casual restaurant that specializes in frozen <unk> 
 for those who do n't know the difference between <unk> and ice cream is that <unk> is <unk> <unk> and does n't have air pockets or ice <unk> like ice cream 
 naturally we get people saying ice cream '' and no one really gives a shit 
 but this one lady who i 'll call the ice cream lady <unk> just did n't understand 
 so i 'm working <unk> making the orders look pretty calling out order numbers etc 
 and my buddy <unk> is working cash register 
 so then i overhear <unk> 's order : & gt <unk> : gim me a double <unk> ice cream cone 
 & gt <unk> : alrighty ... <unk> in order and points to the screen where her order comes up* does everything look good 
 & gt <unk> : uhh that 's not what i ordered bro '' 
 bro 
 really 
 & gt <unk> : uh what 's wrong 
 & gt <unk> : well i ordered an ice cream cone but you put down ... what is that 
 <unk> '' 
 & gt <unk> : well ma'am we do n't sell ice cream we sell <unk> 
 it 's <unk> <unk> and has <unk> ingredients than ice cream 
 & gt <unk> : well i do n't want that 
 i want ice cream 
 & gt <unk> : ma'am we do n't have ice cream 
 & gt <unk> : i need to speak to your manager right now 
 enter <unk> an overall cool guy and he also happens to be our boss 
 he walks up to the counter and puts on his most retail smile 
 & gt <unk> : what seems to be the problem ma'am 
 & gt <unk> : well your cashier here refuses to sell me any ice cream 
 & gt <unk> : that 's because there is not one <unk> of ice cream in this store 
 however we do in fact happen to have quite a few <unk> of <unk> lying around here and there which we happen to be quite famous for 
 & gt <unk> : visibly irritated fine just give me the damn <unk> <unk> 
 yes she continued to pronounce it like that 
 so <unk> rings her up and the cone gets made 
 i grab it and walk up to the microphone 
 & gt me : into microphone guest number <unk> your <unk> is ready please guest number <unk> 
 i know it 's <unk> and i can see her sitting at her table staring at me 
 lol wat 
 so i walk up to the <unk> again 
 & gt me : into microphone guest number <unk> your <unk> is ready please guest number <unk> 
 she still does n't move and the <unk> is starting to melt 
 so i take the cone and walk over to her table 
 & gt me : here you go ma'am 
 & gt <unk> : what is that 
 & gt me : this is your <unk> 
 & gt <unk> : i did n't order that 
 & gt me : yes you did 
 so she stands up slaps the cone out of my hand and yells in my face : although i should mention that i 'm 6 and she was about 5'2 '' & gt <unk> : i did n't fucking order that 
 i ordered fucking ice cream 
 now get me a fucking ice cream cone right now or i will call the fucking cops on your <unk> ass 
 so i thought oh really 
 you 're gon na call the cops 
 obviously i did n't say that as i 'm too much of a <unk> to say that 
 but of course <unk> did 
 & gt <unk> : oh really 
 you 're gon na call the cops 
 & gt <unk> : yes i 'm gon na call the fucking cops because you wo n't serve me correctly 
 so she storms out of the store and gets on her phone i guess to call the police 
 & gt <unk> : jokingly oh great <unk> 
 look what you 've done 
 and i 'm just frozen holding an imaginary <unk> cone 
 inevitably the cops show up and they walk in with <unk> trailing behind <unk> nonsense 
 the cops obviously do n't believe her and they ask <unk> what happened 
 & gt <unk> : she got all worked up because <unk> gave her <unk> instead of ice cream even though she knew very well that we do n't sell ice cream 
 so she hit the <unk> out of his hand and started yelling 
 <unk> did n't like that one bit 
 so she runs up to <unk> and starts fucking hitting him and yelling <unk> <unk> 
 so the two officers run up to her and grab her knock her over and pin her on the ground 
 she was arrested and she was still <unk> <unk> as she was dragged out of the store 
 <unk> apologized to me let me leave early and promised me he 'd clock me out at midnight a whole 4 hours later 
 man what a great <unk> 
 my 
 gosh 
 yesterday was so incredibly slow that i bought myself a logic <unk> book just to get through my shift with my sanity <unk> 
 but i do have a story for you all 
 i 'm about halfway through my shift as a cashier at <unk> and with only two customers in the entire store i 'm basically wandering around looking for things to organize and clean 
 i 'm <unk> back up aisle 7 for the <unk> time when a man comes running at me his eyes wide and his brow wet with sweat 
 a bit of background we have recently stopped <unk> customers into the employee bathroom because they would take merchandise in there use it and not pay for it 
 sweaty man = sm & gt sm : where is your bathroom '' 
 & gt me : i 'm sorry sir but we do not have a public restroom '' 
 & gt sm : ive been on the road 
 where is your bathroom '' 
 & gt me : sir we do n't have a public restroom 
 the fastfood place next door does you can try there '' 
 & gt sm : do you want me to pee on this floor '' 
 <unk> me 
 what 
 * & gt me : sir we absolutely *do not* have a public restroom 
 you can try the fastfood place next door '' 
 & gt sm : ugh 
 whatever '' 
 he proceeds to stomp angrily back to <unk> he <unk> have two sets of registers in the <unk> <unk> store where i work 
 one does <unk> and the other does not 
 the one that does n't do them has signs all over it saying where we do them so customers can see them and not wait in line only for us to tell them to go to the other registers 
 today was busy like really super busy damn you football and i was at the registers that do n't do <unk> 
 the line would build up and the other girl on the registers and i would get through it as fast as we could so people would n't get mad 
 a lady gets to my register after waiting in line for a few minutes less than ten minutes and is holding a bag from where i work and says she wants to do a return 
 i tell her that i 'm sorry but i ca n't do returns at these registers if she goes to the other set of registers they can help her there 
 she was not happy 
 & gt customer : very loudly <unk> 
 are you fucking kidding me 
 the line over there is ridiculous that 's why i came over here 
 you should really put up signs so people can know 
 so i pointed to the <unk> orange 9 '' <unk> '' sign attached to all the registers and the five neon yellow 9 '' <unk> '' signs on the <unk> next to the line where she had been standing for the last few minutes 
 & gt me : there are nearly 10 all around these registers 
 & gt customer : still very loudly i 'm filling a corporate <unk> about you i should n't have to deal with this 
 you should have just done my return 
 so she throws down the bag with her returns in it and storms off 
 i 'm confused the other cashier is confused and the other customers in line that started paying attention when she raised her voice are confused 
 barely a minute later she stomps back over grabs her bag and nearly runs out of the store 
 a few customers laughed and i <unk> from laughing 
 i can only assume i 'm going to have to talk to a manager tomorrow but the other cashier will back me up that it was the customer that screwed up not me.i work at a bank 
 we have a grace period of few minutes after our official closing to allow last minute folks to do a quick teller transactions 
 some people abuse this policy 
 this lady is one of them 
 she <unk> comes to our branch <unk> minutes after our official closing time 
 her transactions are never quick or organized 
 so yesterday when i see her pull into the parking lot i sigh 
 i look at the clock it 's a few minutes into our grace period 
 she 's got 5 minutes to get in the building '' 
 i say to my coworkers 
 she sits in her car a minute i 'm waiting for her to get out 
 a few more minutes go by and she continues to sit in her car 
 finally our grace period is over and she 's made no attempt to enter the building 
 one of our <unk> goes to close the door and i shut the drive-thru 
 my manager runs to hit the lights 
 we finish our closing routine 
 it is now 15 minutes passed closing 
 she then gets out of her car tries the door looks in and turns back to her car 
 she would 've made the grace period and she not sat in her car like a dumbass 
 i guess she figured we would let her in no matter what time it was 
 it felt so satisfying to lock the doors on her after she continued to abuse the grace period time 
 i work in a popular retail store in the states 
 more specifically i have worked primarily in the clothing department for 3 years 
 my store is <unk> towards middle class family 's but occasionally we will get the upper class <unk> 
 this is where my story begins 
 it 's right before christmas and i 'm working in the jewelry + a few department s that day 
 when you work in jewelry you have to have a pair of keys on you in case a shopper wants to look at something inside a case 
 anyways i 'm putting away some items in another department when i get a call over the walkie to assist a guest at the jewelry booth 
 so i go up and see a man probably in his 40s with his two teenage sons the oldest could not have been more then 15 and the other one just a little younger 
 this is how the next half hour of life goes 
 me will be me 
 ad will be asshole dad 
 <unk> will be older and nervous son 
 and <unk> will be younger son 
 & gt me : hello my name is <unk> how may i help you today 
 & gt ad : yeah yeah 
 gee what a great start & gt ad : see my son bought this heart <unk> for his girlfriend here earlier today and when he told me the price i told him to return it and get something better for her 
 this sweet guy bought his girlfriend a cute heart <unk> for christmas 
 how sweet is that 
 & gt me : oh i 'm sorry was there anything wrong with the item 
 & gt ad : *looks at <unk> yeah it was dirt cheap 
 & gt <unk> : *looks at floor <unk> whoa whoa whoa for one this kid could not have been more then 15 years old therefore i highly doubt he had a job or if he did one that did n't pay very well 
 second this <unk> was about 25 dollars something that i know when i was 15 was a lot of money at the time 
 & gt me : <unk> the best smile i can <unk> okay well is there anything you see that you like in the cases 
 & gt ad : *points to a <unk> <unk> <unk> how much is this one 
 & gt me : about $ 25 
 & gt ad : <unk> 
 do you have anything that 's more expensive 
 & gt me : i 'm afraid not really sir 
 & gt <unk> : <unk> his <unk> uh oh here we go 
 & gt <unk> : *sighs* & gt ad : wow your stuff here is super cheap 
 how do you guys make any money 
 i mentioned before that our store is <unk> towards middle class family 's 
 we 're not a cheap store but at the same time our prices are n't so high up that we have people coming in wearing <unk> and <unk> 
 & gt me : <unk> <unk> haha well we do sir 
 & gt ad : well if you were receiving a piece of jewelry would n't you rather it be more expensive then cheap 
 i look at the dad then look back at the older and nervous son as he looks incredibly <unk> and hurt by his <unk> words 
 & gt me : honestly sir it 's the thought and feeling behind the gift that makes it more <unk> to me then the price 
 i do and did truly mean that 
 the older and nervous son looked at me with a thank you '' expression on his face while his younger brother chimed in in agreement 
 & gt <unk> : yeah dad i agree with her 
 & gt ad : *sighs* okay i guess we will look around a bit more 
 this seems to be where the story ends but nope 
 while the family or i should say the dad looks around for a gift for the older sons girlfriend i go back to another section to help another coworker out 
 it 's not long until i hear that alert for the jewelry booth again 
 <unk> 
 i go back up to see the dad and his sons again and dad tapping the counter in annoyance 
 & gt ad : we decided to take the <unk> <unk> we saw before 
 unless your sure that this is the most expensive thing you have here 
 dude seriously 
 let the price go 
 & gt ad : i mean do n't you think your items here are cheap 
 they probably break after wearing them once too 
 if i was n't upset by the <unk> treatment of his son before trust me when i say i was mad at this point 
 i should also mention that not one but a couple of my supervisors were close by and getting bits and pieces about what was going on 
 & gt me : no sir i think the items are a good price for the quality you are getting 
 & gt ad : which is cheap 
 & gt me : <unk> much <unk> sir would you like the <unk> or would you like me to put it back 
 & gt ad : <unk> <unk> you want it 
 & gt <unk> : <unk> in <unk> yeah i guess 
 the dad first hands me a <unk> that is worth around 15 dollars 
 fine done processed it 
 & gt me : okay sir you still have about $ 10 and whatever change left 
 the asshole of a dad then hands me a $ 100 bill 
 and then give me such a smug i 'm better then your little store '' look 
 i quickly just took the $ 100 and gave back his roughly speaking $ 90 dollars back in change and told the family to have a nice day 
 the sons are really embarrassed and are <unk> sorry to me over and over again 
 before they leave though the dad says to me ... & gt ad : you know you should really try to go to college and do better for yourself 
 so let me get this straight one you make your son return an item that he bought with his own money for his girlfriend that has a lot of heart behind it 
 i do n't care if the guy is only 15 he obviously cares a lot about this girl 
 second you <unk> my store by calling it cheap over and over again and even try to get me to call it cheap and possibly get fired because my supervisors are listening 
 and third you <unk> me and give me a mouth load of crap telling me to do better for myself and go to college 
 why do you think i have this job in the first place 
 do not <unk> in my personal life 
 luckily as soon as the dad said that the younger son in complete horror thanked me for my help and made his dad leave the counter while the older and nervous son apologized for his <unk> behavior and thanked me for my patience and left 
 after i breathed in and out for a couple minutes i went back to the fitting room to grab more items to get put away 
 and guess what i found 
 the heart <unk> that the dad made his son return 
 i know in one sense the dad felt like he was helping out his son but in all reality it was really just making his son feel ashamed for something he should not have ever felt <unk> about 
 **edit** - for formatting and grammar **edit 2** - holy smokes guys 
 this is n't as much an edit as it is a thank you 
 as amazing as this story is i never thought i 'd get this kind of response 
 <unk> - asshole of a dad makes his son return a <unk> he thought was too cheap for his sons girlfriend and continued calling my store cheap until he left 
 the past three days one specific customer - let 's call her <unk> - has entered the store looking for a washer and <unk> 
 all three days i opened the store and she would walk in around <unk> am - a strong woman with consumer reports '' magazines in her hand and an opinion about everything i showed her 
 each day with her was a <unk> and more confusing than the day before 
 day 1 : she enters the store since her washer and <unk> broke and wants the one in the ad '' 
 since that 's on back order for a week i start showing her other things in the store while asking questions 
 with each washer and <unk> that i show her she <unk> 
 well consumer reports say this washer and <unk> is n't good because it does n't have <unk> '' or consumer reports says high <unk> <unk> is a waste of time so i do n't want to hear it '' 
 she <unk> for our in-store card and is approved for $ 1500 but still wants to shop around 
 i give her my card and she <unk> to our competitors 
 day 2 : <unk> comes back in and says we have the best deal in town yep 
 but wants financing her say - 6 months interest free 
 i ca n't control what the computer gives us and i explain that to her as well as my manager 
 well competing store had the same washer and <unk> i want for $ 100 less and six months financing so i will just go there '' 
 wait did n't you say that we had the best deal in town 
 <unk> leaves again 
 now at this point i did n't think she would come back and neither does anyone in the store 
 day 3 : as i am cleaning behind a washer and <unk> i hear someone calling my name from the front desk 
 there stands another manager and <unk> consumer reports in hand <unk> in hand 
 sorry i left they had the same washer and <unk> but would n't give me the deal again 
 you can see on these <unk> '' 
 the <unk> had different model numbers but her heart was set on a silver set 
 could i add a <unk> with it 
 i need to get mine changed anyway '' 
 of course you can 
 - i said it in my <unk> retail voice - and found her a <unk> that would not only match with the washer and <unk> but would also match her fridge in her kitchen 
 i go to the register to check stock on everything - everything is in stock delivery would be scheduled for monday and we would hook it all up plus a <unk> <unk> because the washer and <unk> and <unk> were the same brand plus delivery <unk> 
 basically she would get back $ <unk> in a credit to use in the store 
 the total for everything was around $ 1800 so she decided to pay $ 1000 in cash and put the rest on the store credit card to receive <unk> payments 
 again the computer automatically decides the financing option depending on the total 6 months $ <unk> $ <unk> 12 months $ <unk> $ <unk> 24 months $ <unk> and above and all of it <unk> 
 to me this was a great deal but anyway ... after she pays her $ 1000 in cash i run the card for the remaining $ 800 and i thought the computer would give her 12 months 
 it did n't - it gave her 24 months under the <unk> that the total before cash was in the 24 months range and even though she paid $ 1000 in cash she would have 24 months to pay 
 now in my mind and the mind of everyone around me this was great - you had longer to pay it off 
 not so much 
 <unk> flips her mind - i do n't want 24 months i only want 12 months financing 
 why ca n't you get that in your peanut head 
 what did i tell you yesterday 
 tell the computer to give me 12 months '' 
 again i ca n't tell the computer to do it and she would have a longer time to pay it off 
 well ma'am you can pay it off in 12 months or shorter 
 you do n't have to go to the full <unk> months it 's all interest free '' 
 that is n't good to her because she wants it in writing on my <unk> bill '' 
 she throws her magazines down on the ground takes back her $ 1000 and makes a scene by screaming at the computer give me 12 months dammit '' 
 she walks out without buying the washer <unk> and <unk> 
 my manager looks at me as well as a couple of associates with confused faces 
 <unk> you have to stop bringing out the crazy in customers '' my manager tried to say in a straight face but just could n't stop laughing 
 hey first time poster long time lurker the usual 
 also i 'm on mobile so formatting might be awkward so i work at a fast food store and we have a product that has a few variations like how you can get different <unk> in ice cream 
 i was working on drive thru when a very special customer comes through 
 we 'll call him c for customer 
 & gt me : hi 
 what can i get for you 
 & gt c : can i please get two product with multiple variations 
 & gt me : yep was it the one with <unk> 1 
 & gt c : yeah it 's not like you sell any others 
 & gt me : actually we have multiple ones such as the <unk> 2 or the <unk> 3 
 & gt c : no you do n't sell those 
 & gt me : ... & gt c : ... & gt me : so two <unk> one packs comes to $ <unk> 
 at this point he essentially shoves the exact amount into my hands and drives off 
 i do n't understand why some people feel the need to be right with the most little things 
 edit : in drive thru at our store they order and pay at one window and collect their food at the next 
 edit2 : formatting : guy came in today bought a phone card and sunglasses 
 with the service plan on the phone came to <unk> and change 
 so he pulls out his wallet counts his money ... he <unk> have <unk> or so apparently 
 he does n't 
 he has ... <unk> he 's freaking out 
 there 's no way he can get the phone and the card without at least a few more dollars 
 he starts <unk> in front of my register freaking out about his missing money 
 he stops 
 he looks down at his shoe 
 he takes his shoe off and flips it over 
 a 20 dollar bill falls out 
 that little <unk> '' 
 apparently his 7 year old daughter has a history of stealing money out of peoples <unk> and putting it in their shoes ... i work in a used media store 
 we sell dvds <unk> <unk> cds and games for most consoles 
 yesterday a customer came in while i was in the back 
 we were playing a clean copy of <unk> 's the <unk> in the store and i guess he liked whatever song was playing when he came in and asked if the cd was for sale 
 my co-worker explained that the cd playing over the store was the <unk> version and the customer said he 'd prefer to buy the <unk> 
 about this time i came out from the back 
 since i was closer to the rap section my co-worker asked if i could check for the cd 
 we had it the customer bought it end of story 
 except not really 
 about six hours later i get a call from that same customer 
 me : hello <unk> this is <unk> speaking 
 how can i help you '' 
 customer : <unk> that song is n't on this cd '' 
 me : i 'm sorry '' 
 customer : i was in there earlier and that song is n't on this cd '' 
 with this detailed <unk> i was able to figure out who it was i was speaking to 
 thankfully we 'd been pretty slow that day so remembering any particular customer was pretty easy 
 me : the <unk> and ryan <unk> cd sir '' 
 customer : yeah i wanted that song i heard when i was there and it 's not on this 
 you know what i 'm talking about '' 
 me : well sir i do n't remember what particular song was playing while you were here but that cd is the same one we sold to you 
 i 'm sure if you listen through it you 'll find which song you were looking for '' 
 customer : well i 'm looking at it and i do n't see the song '' 
 me : do you know what the song is called sir '' 
 customer : no '' 
 me : then you may not be <unk> its title on the back '' 
 customer : okay but you know what i 'm talking about right '' 
 me : well again sir i was n't even at the front of the store when it was playing so i really have no idea what particular song you heard when you were <unk> 
 customer : but this is the same cd '' 
 me : yes sir '' 
 customer : you sure '' 
 me : i 'm positive 
 if you just listen through the cd i 'm sure you 'll find the song you 're looking for '' 
 *click* i really hate being hung up <unk> i graduated college i worked at a package store in my <unk> 
 we had a fancy <unk> pos computer for ringing up orders 
 we accepted debit and credit 
 this is important 
 a lot of my customers got to know me pretty well 
 they knew i was in college and knew i was <unk> computer science 
 i 've got a line of a few customers and in walks cash back girl <unk> 
 & gt <unk> : <unk> to the front of the line and waving her debit <unk> tell me how much is on this 
 & gt me : uhm ... i ca n't 
 there 's an atm right next door though 
 & gt <unk> : no you can do it 
 i 've done it before 
 & gt me : ma'am there 's no way for me to tell you how much money is on your card 
 & gt <unk> : yes there is 
 & lt manager & gt has done it for me before 
 & gt me : ma'am listen 
 i wrote the software that i 'm using on this computer and i know for a fact it can not do that 
 i 'm sorry i ca n't help you 
 and then she stormed out 
 i apologized to my customers and one of them asked & gt did you really 
 & gt me : of course not 
 <unk> have a few more stories from this place if anybody is interested <unk> : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 **story : ** one of the benefits i offer my employees is that i provide food for them when they 're working 
 to keep it from getting boring i try to switch it up between fast food subs pizza <unk> and mom 's home cooking the most popular 
 we usually set up a <unk> about 20 away from the tent near our <unk> with tables and chairs so that employees can grab a bite when they get a chance 
 it 's not uncommon for friends who 've stopped by to sit down and grab a bite with us 
 in fact if mom 's cooking it 's almost expected 
 one afternoon as i was passing by the register counter one of my cashiers called over to me and asked who the kids that were eating outside were 
 i turned around and looked at the <unk> of the tent and there were four kids somewhere between the ages of 6 and <unk> sitting under the <unk> <unk> on our pizza and drinking our <unk> 
 i walked up to the cashier and told her that i had no idea who they were 
 i wondered aloud if maybe my dad or one of the other employees had invited someone to eat with us 
 while i was speaking to the cashier the guy who she had been ringing up finished his purchase grabbed his bags and headed out the door 
 i watched him walk around to the back side of the tent and tell his kids that it was time to go 
 one of the kids whined that they <unk> finished so he told them to bring it with them 
 they grabbed the plates of pizza stacked high the <unk> <unk> and headed out to an suv 
 i was honestly so shocked that i didn’t move a muscle i just stared at the guy dumbfounded with my mouth hanging open 
 the entire time he was walking out getting into the suv and driving off he never looked back or made eye contact with me 
 stone 
 cold 
 bastard 
 -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here this was yesterday morning as i walked in before opening at a retail store known for it 's nature of closing stores lately 
 the phone rings so i decide to answer it because why not probably someone calling to see when we open 
 & gt me : store security & gt old lady : when do you open 
 & gt me : the store opens in 30 minutes at 8 am 
 & gt ol : well i need help right now 
 sounding upset crying my phone does n't work and i need help 
 & gt me : well we can not help you with anything until we open at 8. once we open at 8 we will be more than happy to help you in electronics 
 & gt ol : i 'm <unk> years old 
 i ca n't walk and no one can take me there 
 why wo n't you help me 
 you 're just going to let me die 
 & gt me : ma'am we will gladly help you if you come into the store and we do n't wish death upon anyone 
 if you need help you need to call 911 immediately only if it 's an emergency 
 & gt ol : what 's 911 
 & gt me : the emergency police line that you need to call right now if you 're in a situation where you 're concerned you 're going to die 
 & gt ol : but why wo n't you help me 
 you 're just going to let me die 
 & gt me : ma'am please hold while i get my manager 
 my manager answers it and looks visibly confused 
 & gt manager : ma'am we can not send an employee to your home to assist you with your phone 
 manager hangs up two minutes later 
 she says that she was screaming at her about how we 're trying to kill her and hung up angrily 
 i do n't know why along with my duties as a minimum wage electronics department retail worker i 've suddenly become an <unk> 911 <unk> 
 and that 's how my morning started on saturday november 8 2014 at <unk> am 
 tl dr woman calls and demands we go to her home to help with a phone screams at us for trying to kill her when we say no 
 **background : ** i work as an assistant manager at a large chicken fast-food chain while putting my way through med school 
 i can only work part-time due to my studies but the company was great about letting me keep my job since i 've been with them since high school 
 **the story : ** this happened in the very first week of <unk> 
 i 'd only been managing shifts for 3 weeks 
 a lady came in to the restaurant with her 2 kids 
 it was a bit of a slow day and we had competent employees on shift so i went out to clean some tables and greet customers like our district manager wanted us to 
 hi welcome to chicken restaurant how are you today '' 
 i said that to this lady with a big smile and she just sort of gave me a weird look and went up to the cashier 
 whatever it is kind of weird that we are greeting people at a fast-food place 
 i continued to clean up as the lady made a big order for her kids and her 
 i noticed to my annoyance that she ordered water for herself and then put sweet tea in the cup 
 note that our water cups are different from drink cups and made of clear plastic so this takes a lot of <unk> to do right in front of a manager 
 ah well i thought she gave us plenty of money on the order nothing i can do about the drink 
 well i finished sweeping up the lobby and then went back behind the counter to check on the <unk> who naturally were doing their job perfectly 
 food is coming up people are eating it 
 it 's a great shift 
 but then this lady decides to ruin it and come up to talk to me dragging her two kids behind and holding a plate of <unk> food 
 let 's call her annoying 
 annoying : are you a manager 
 me : yes ma'am how is your visit to chicken restaurant today 
 a : you guys got my order wrong 
 me : oh i am sorry to hear that let me see 
 a *hands me receipt* : we ordered <unk> sandwich with clever <unk> <unk> but actually got <unk> meal with a hilarious pun <unk> 
 me : well ma'am the receipt has the chicken meal on here how do you think that happened 
 never suggest that an employee messed up because they will jump on that suggestion like it 's a <unk> <unk> 
 a : i think the cashier <unk> the order 
 of course the cashier <unk> the order 
 i get about 3 people a week saying that this happened so that the manager will <unk> and give them something free 
 i normally just go along with it i have to by company policy if they make a formal complaint anyway but not today 
 today i have started college 
 i can stand up to these other adults now 
 me : well i specifically heard the cashier repeat the order to you 
 i do n't see how that could have happened 
 i think you simply <unk> 
 a : no i did n't 
 i want a refund on this meal and the correct one for free 
 me : i 'm afraid i ca n't do that 
 you 've already eaten most of this meal 
 you should have come up and told me right away 
 i hope you have a good day and enjoy that drink you did n't pay for 
 we look forward to seeing you again 
 annoying turned bright bright red as her kids looked up at her 
 the <unk> smartass son spoke up : mommy i <unk> you that cup was only for water '' 
 she told me that i had been very unhelpful and sped out the door 
 she never gave me a complaint and all the employees on shift loved me forever 
 i still have to give in to <unk> fairly regularly i.e 
 all the time jeez its awful but man did it feel good to see one put in her <unk> so i am a lurker who has never desired to create a reddit account nor <unk> sorry 
 but this happened to me yesterday and i knew it was my duty as a retail <unk> to share with you all 
 i 'm also maybe looking for some advice 
 last night about a half hour before my shift at the gas station ended <unk> walks in to buy some gas and a bag of chips 
 as i swipe his card he starts <unk> very loudly 
 i ask him what 's wrong and he asks if i can swipe it again '' 
 well no sir 
 the transaction went through 
 it wo n't be necessary to swipe your card again for this purchase '' 
 so if i buy something else you 'll swipe my big card through that <unk> of yours again 
 i want it swiped good and fast '' 
 it was then that i realized what he was doing 
 of course i am totally disgusted but in a moment of <unk> and not knowing what to do i did not refuse service and i let him buy a candy bar 
 however this time i did not swipe his card but manually keyed his number in 
 he still <unk> a second time and laughed as he exited 
 i am so <unk> out 
 what 's going on with the world 
 i do n't even <unk> in a particularly bad city 
 this guy was just an awful human <unk> i was a bit younger i worked for a mom and pop sandwich and coffee shop in a cute little <unk> town 
 the job was n't too bad though we had to wear stupid polo shirts with the company logo printed on the breast which we had to pay for 
 i basically spent most of my time taking orders making fancy coffee drinks and handing out food to those that decided to sit in to eat 
 as winter rolled around i asked the boss for a week to go back to my fine home state of <unk> for a visit 
 he said that it would be fine and gave me the time off 
 all went pretty well until about three days before i was scheduled to return 
 i got a call from the bossman informing me that he had fired one of my co-workers for some offense or another and needed me in asap 
 i told him that i could n't adjust my tickets and besides i was in a huge state about three hours from an airport while being at the <unk> of other people who wanted to drive me around 
 after making many frustrated noises he finally <unk> his request was unreasonable and i assured him i 'd be home when i planned 
 the day of the return trip arrived and i was off on my way to a <unk> flight in <unk> 
 <unk> 
 sadly this is where i was locked down 
 after many weather <unk> my flight was finally cancelled 
 no dice nothing coming or going until the next morning 
 i immediately called the bossman and let him know the situation on his voicemail 
 much to my surprise i arrived at work asap to see if they could use me for the shift and was promptly told that i do not work there any longer 
 much wat 
 fuck him <unk> i thought and walked next door to my buddy 's bookstore to see if he could use a hand seeing as i was now <unk> 
 he agreed and all was well though my hours were much reduced 
 the best part was one day when my friend and i were parked in such a way that was blocking the former bossman 's truck and he wanted out 
 instead of asking he walked up to my friend 's driver side window and started a rude rant which was quickly shut down when he noticed me in the passenger seat giving him a <unk> look 
 it felt pretty <unk> 'm the head supervisor at my store 
 we have all our holiday merchandise in a specific section of the store because it 's on <unk> are a lot of people in this section trying to get all they can and they all want help finding certain items 
 i 'm helping one customer do the math for certain items that are 30 % off and explaining how i got the answer 
 some older people i swear just like having me perform math even though we have price <unk> everywhere 
 in the middle of doing this i get a tap on my shoulder 
 me : me 
 complaining customer : cc cc : ma'am you need to tell me how much this is 
 me : flips over item to look at the price tag $ <unk> 
 returns to help original customer when cc returns a minute later 
 cc : ma'am it 's in the clearance section 
 how much is it now 
 me : the final total will ring up at the registers or you could use the price scanner station right at the end of this aisle 
 cc : i do n't know how to use that 
 me : please allow me to finish helping this customer and i 'll assist you right away 
 cc : why is she getting your help and not me 
 me : i was helping her first 
 i promise i 'll be right with you 
 cc : no you should help me now 
 i 'm a paying customer too 
 what makes her so special 
 the first customer sees what 's happening and insists that she 'll figure it out on her own 
 she smiles shakes my hand and says 'good luck with that one '' 
 cc : good luck '' 
 what 's that supposed to mean 
 me : here let me show you how this works 
 i walk her over 
 after scanning her item cc is mad 
 her item is actually not on clearance 
 cc : you 're trying to rip me off 
 i want to talk to your supervisor 
 me : i am the supervisor 
 i apologize for the inconvenience but another customer must have left it here 
 cc : why the hell is your store such a mess 
 i just want to buy things and you ca n't keep things clean 
 me : i will be organizing this aisle when i 'm done <unk> you 
 is there anything else i can help you find 
 cc : but i moved this to the clearance baskets 
 why did n't it go on sale 
 realizing that she seems to think that moving an item to the clearance section was going to drop the price 
 me : the information in the computer was n't changed just this item 's location 
 the company enters a discount for this particular bar code 
 since they did n't do that there 's nothing i can do about this item 's price 
 cc : but i moved it myself 
 look i changed this one 's price too 
 hands me a different item from her cart with a sticker on it that says sale 
 only <unk> cents 
 me : ma'am that 's now how the system works 
 the price is scanned off of this bar code not the sticker 
 this item is going to be $ <unk> before tax 
 cc : no 
 see 
 right there 
 it says <unk> cents 
 me : feeling irritated now i took the sticker off of the new item 
 and now it does n't 
 it 's $ <unk> '' 
 cc : if you can change the prices why ca n't i 
 me : because the world is a <unk> and unfair place 
 i 'm sorry you 're on the rough side of it all 
 with absolute <unk> she says thank you '' 
 and leaves my store leaving behind a cart full of items that she had put stickers on in order to change the price 
 **hey tfr 
 i 'm the girl who works at the arcade mentioned in this post and this week i had another annoying customer 
 ** basically a large group of customers all came up to the counter at once and instead of forming a nice <unk> queue for me because seriously who does that 
 everyone was stood in big <unk> <unk> along the counter 
 i had no idea who to serve first so i just went for the two <unk> year <unk> nearest to me 
 about three words into the transaction a woman literally shoved the kids out of the way pulled her own daughter into view and said & gt <unk> : ** excuse me she was here first 
 & gt **me : ** ma'am i 'm sorry but these boys were closest to me 
 & gt <unk> : ** no no she got here first 
 & gt **me : ** sorry but i 'll have to serve her after these customers 
 the woman <unk> slightly to the side looking very pissed 
 i looked back to the kids and asked them what <unk> they wanted 
 they <unk> pointed out the toys behind the glass instead of talking 
 as i went to get their <unk> out i heard the woman <unk> 
 & gt <unk> : ** how dare you 
 you kids got to learn some manners 
 say please and thank you and do n't point 
 the kids looked a bit frightened and embarrassed but managed to let out a <unk> <unk> '' before they grabbed their toys and bolted out of there as fast as they could 
 the woman took this opportunity to shove her daughter in front of me again 
 & gt <unk> to her child : ** now choose whatever you 'd like dear 
 & gt <unk> : ** could i please have that <unk> <unk> & gt <unk> : ** <unk> that 's too <unk> 
 choose something else 
 & gt <unk> : ** um could i get that <unk> set 
 & gt <unk> : ** no you 'll not be getting that 
 & gt <unk> : ** okay can i have the dog tags 
 they 're like a <unk> 
 & gt <unk> to me this time : ** nevermind just get her that purse and some <unk> with the rest 
 i raise my eyebrow at her as the girl protests to her mother 
 & gt <unk> : ** mum i do n't like purses i wanted that other stuff 
 at this point they start a full blown shouting match about how little girls should have <unk> things and how much the girl hates her mother and so on so forth 
 all the other customers are looking between them and me so panicking i signal the supervisor over 
 she asks the woman to leave 
 & gt <unk> : ** you 're <unk> my customers 
 you 'll have to leave 
 & gt **woman** i have every right to be here 
 & gt <unk> : ** and i have every right to ask you to leave 
 go now before i call security 
 the woman flashed me an angry look <unk> her daughter along with her and then finally left 
 sometimes i hate <unk> 's a monday evening and i 'm driving my girlfriend to the downtown to run some errands 
 she 's a full time waitress incredibly personal and very sweet 
 we 're sitting talking about whatever we happened to be engaged in at the time when suddenly she stopped when her eyes lit up 
 * '' oh god i have an embarrassing story to tell you about work last night 
 * i glance over at her letting her know she has my full attention 
 * '' so i get this <unk> a mother and her little son 
 she looks to be low 30s pretty short brown hair and has this adorable child perhaps <unk> who 's busy <unk> on the paper place mats 
 * * '' i get their drink order and when i come back she <unk> smiles at me and orders a turkey sandwich 
 now this is where it gets weird : her face turns serious looks me dead in the eyes and says : 'do your burgers complain 
 * * '' and i pause 
 * my girlfriend is laughing awkwardly as i smile at her 
 i have n't a clue where this story is going but this lady sounds mentally crazy 
 she continues : * '' i nervously laugh and <unk> out a simple : 'what 
 this is when the lady again looks at me and simply repeats except more slowly : 'do your burgers ... 
 complain 
 * * '' i have no idea what to do at this point 
 how do you help someone who is mental 
 anxiously i laugh again to try to relieve the tension as i say : 'i 'm sorry ma'am but burgers do n't talk 
 <unk> * '' now we pause for perhaps 4 solid seconds before the lady 's mouth cracks and bursts out laughing 
 she waves her hands saying : <unk> i 'm so sorry 
 i guess i 'm not being that clear 
 what i mean to say is : are there toppings on the burgers as in : do your burgers come plain 
 '' * i 'm laughing so hard at this point i had to <unk> to the side of the road 
 obligatory mobile formatting message 
 so working retail in a mall that serves a wide area of <unk> we get people from all walks of life applying 
 mostly local students between school <unk> but occasionally we get less <unk> folks 
 this is the story of one such hire 's last appearance in the store 
 for some background j '' as i 'll call him was hired last september to work <unk> since one of the other guys was leaving 
 they wound up staying but we kept j anyway because the sm said we needed to fill the schedule with hours 
 so j finishes training and comes down to the sales floor 
 and promptly falls asleep at the <unk> register in plain view of the entire store 
 and of course his behavior gets worse 
 smoking weed before coming in 
 falling asleep multiple times a shift 
 cursing in front <unk> customers not even getting off his ass sitting on the display recliners and shouting at customers if they need help etc 
 but despite everyone even the <unk> wanting him gone sm refused to fire <unk> eventually december rolls around 
 j is cut to 5 hours a week because a we all hate him and he messes up sales and b those were the hours that were available 
 3 weeks pass 3 shifts missed <unk> each time 
 he 's fired for abandoning the job 
 when the termination letter goes out his mom finally calls saying he 's in the hospital 
 too little too late we explain and that 's that 
 until last thursday 
 when j walks in through the door and has the balls to ask : & gt j : yo who do i talk to about getting back on the schedule 
 to which we stare dumbfounded at the guy and tell him you 're fired 
 you do n't work here '' 
 & gt j : i was in the hospital come on man 
 how can i get back on 
 and we tell him again you basically abandoned the job for a month 
 no calls at all 
 you lost the job '' 
 j just keeps whining he was in the hospital and eventually goes up to hr 
 few minutes later he leaves without a word 
 when we told our manager his response was what we assume hr 's was as well : oh well lol '' *edit : fixed stupid auto <unk> from <unk> by request 
 about 12 years ago when i used to work at a pharmacy as a tech 
 a middle aged deaf woman came in for a refill so she and i <unk> by written notes 
 as she and i are writing notes back and forth to each other a douche bag walks up talking on the cell phone and proceeds to complain about this woman to the other person on the phone 
 he was a truly hateful prick about it and was so obnoxious 
 needless to say i personally filled her <unk> and had her out the door in less than five minutes 
 however for some <unk> reason his prescription kept getting sent to the end of the line never to be filled 
 after about 30 minutes he asks to speak to my boss and complains about it taking so long 
 it was one of the busiest <unk> in <unk> city but tons of people that came in after him were getting their meds and leaving 
 my boss calms him down by telling him that his <unk> would be next and walks over to me and says what 's the deal here 
 why do you keep moving his stuff to the back of the line '' 
 i <unk> told my boss what the douche bag was doing and that it really pissed me off 
 my boss a really cool guy says right on '' then kept the asshole waiting another half <unk> i was at work and as usual asking customers if they need any help i approach this woman and ask : do you need any help there '' 
 she replies : yes i 'm just looking to try on some <unk> '' i reply : yes of course the changing rooms are straight ahead of you '' she then quite <unk> and angrily replies : yes of course i know that '' i then reply ok cool '' she then replies : well you asked me whether i was ok now i 'm <unk> you it is cool is n't it '' i then walked off i literally got <unk> harassed for asking someone if they needed any <unk> guys 
 long time lurker first time poster and if this goes well i 'll submit some more of my stories <unk> in a gift store that sells gifts for all ages between 6 months and death 
 ** now before i start off with the story this happened to a coworker of mine but i had the absolute pleasure of watching it <unk> 
 so it was a relatively okay day 
 not too much a busy day has <unk> at the end of it this one only had 8 or 9. now this odd looking guy walks into the store i would say mid 20s crazy hair you can tell he 's weird ... he wanted a gift for his girlfriend 
 how nice ... we helped him out picking her something small cheap and cute and up to the register he came 
 now this is the part it starts getting weird 
 he sets down the <unk> doll we helped him pick the <unk> absurd <unk> card he got her and <unk> my coworker if she 's on her period 
 * being the <unk> person she is she goes with it 
 we know we 'll get a laugh out of it 
 she answers and says i do to which he replies ** '' do you have a spare tampon 
 ** ... <unk> takes out a tampon she has on hand and hands it over laughing as do i. the card he chose is a congratulations on your newborn son '' 
 he then asks her to write in pretty letters : that we do n't have bless jesus love you '' they were <unk> her period <unk> he proceeds to tie the tampon to the doll let us take a picture and walks off 
 most <unk> experiences in my store 
 more to come 
 : di am in a middle management position and i work for a bakery which is owned by a <unk> corporation 
 we sell cookies <unk> coffee smoothies etc 
 not long after christmas i felt <unk> and called in sick to work 
 i had <unk> that morning because of a stomach bug 
 i was told by my manager that because there was nobody available to cover my shift i still had to come into work 
 reluctantly i took some pain <unk> and made the <unk> journey to work 
 i felt rough most of the day and tried to focus on <unk> tasks and paperwork rather than serve customers 
 it 's not nice for a customer to be served by someone who looks like death <unk> up 
 3 hours into my shift i start to feel sick again so i go to the toilet and end up <unk> again 
 once i 'd finished i phoned my manager and said i was leaving because i had just <unk> again 
 i was warned that if i did that i would possibly leave myself open to a disciplinary for leaving the shop insecure '' because i was the only key holder on shift and nobody else was allowed to close the shop unless a key holder was present 
 i was <unk> to take it easy '' for the rest of the shift 
 5 hours later and i could finally leave after what was quite possibly the worst shift in my 9 years working in retail 
 i took the next five days off work to recover and put the whole incident behind me 
 flash forward 3 weeks and i receive a letter <unk> to me delivered to my work 
 this is unusual 
 this had never happened before 
 so i open the letter and inside is a short generic letter <unk> me for an investigation meeting '' on the other side of the city with a manager of another store i had never heard of 
 my immediate reaction in my head was oh it 's probably about that customer who tried to assault another member of staff a few weeks ago '' 
 i was on shift and a <unk> customer accused a member of staff of short changing him so he took a swing and tried to hit him 
 because of the nature of the incident we had to report it even though he was n't hurt 
 so i pop along to this investigation meeting and i 'm met by the manager mentioned in the letter and a younger guy in his early 20s who is there to take notes 
 the meeting is conducted in a kitchen with no seats which seems a little unusual for a formal meeting but none the less i am not too bothered 
 he <unk> himself to me and myself to him 
 he begins by asking where i usually take my lunch breaks 
 this is not really what i expected but let 's carry on 
 i explain i usually take my lunch break in the food court 
 the guy taking notes writes down all the questions and my answers word for word 
 anywhere else '' 
 is the next question 
 well i occasionally go to the park in the summer and have my lunch there '' 
 not a <unk> practice in any case as our lunch breaks are unpaid 
 would you ever take your lunch in the shop 
 this is against company policy because of food safety etc 
 no i do n't 
 i like to get out of there for a while '' i <unk> to try and <unk> the <unk> 
 ok. would you ever use your mobile phone in the shop '' 
 he asks 
 yes i use it occasionally to contact the manager when he is not in the shop or to contact the delivery driver because the land line phone in the shop has stopped working '' 
 this is an honest answer and a reasonable one 
 i should refuse to use my own phone for work use but im a nice guy 
 have you ever used your phone for texting people while you were at work '' 
 i 'm asked 
 well i text the manager a few times with sales figures but not very often '' 
 his tone of voice becomes increasingly aggressive with no known cause at this point 
 what do you have to say about this '' 
 he presents me with an a4 size glossy photo of myself sitting on a chair in the back of the shop with my phone in my hand 
 the photo seems to have been taken on a long <unk> camera from a <unk> distance from the outside of the shop 
 the date and time stamp on the photo <unk> to the day i was sick a few weeks earlier 
 i then tell him this was an occasion when i was feeling <unk> and i forced to attend work and was not allowed to leave my shift to go home despite the fact that i had <unk> twice that day because of a stomach bug 
 you expect me to believe ... that after being sick your manager said you had to come to work then <unk> you from going home when you are sick again and tells you to <unk> it easy 
 i am now feeling angry and shocked at his response 
 however i have something he did n't expect 
 yes i do expect you to believe it ... ... '' i reach for my phone in my pocket and play back the calls 
 i record all of my calls just in case something happened although i never expect myself to be in <unk> position this is completely legal where i live 
 after playing the <unk> he tells me that it 's against company policy to have my phone in an investigation meeting i 'm sure he made that up otherwise he would have said it before i played the <unk> 
 i then tell him excuse me i think the bigger issue here is that <unk> <unk> has broken food safety law by forcing a member of staff who has been sick to work around food 
 since the start of this meeting the guy taking notes has been writing everything said word for word 
 the manager <unk> me now holds his hand over the notes and says to the note <unk> hold on a minute '' before he has a chance to write what i have just said 
 i am getting angry and upset because he wo n't allow this to be written down 
 i tell him that if he does n't allow this to be written down i will leave the meeting right now and go to our head office on the other side of the city to explain the whole thing to them 
 he eventually allows what i have said to be written down 
 before i have a chance to say anything else he proclaims it is now <unk> and i am <unk> this meeting '' 
 he then leaves the room with no other explanation 
 the guy taking notes is still in the room with me 
 off the record he tells me he is also shocked at the way this meeting has been conducted 
 he said he has never been told to stop writing after someone has said something 
 we <unk> discuss the situation between ourselves 
 10 minutes later the manager returns with a letter he has printed out 
 he explains that he has <unk> the matter to a disciplinary hearing in five days time 
 there is no mention on the letter of the reason 
 when i demand to know why he simply says the meeting is over 
 i have nothing else to say '' 
 flash forward five days later and i attend the disciplinary hearing with a different manager 
 the reason given 
 because i have arrived late for work on four occasions in the past 6 months 
 this is such a minor issue that this has never been mentioned to me before now 
 all of the times i have arrived late have been because of public transport issues which are <unk> <unk> after the event 
 none of these have exceeded 10 minutes on any occasion 
 it happens to everyone but we do n't make a big deal about it because unless you want to spend half your daily pay on car parking public transport is the only way to get here 
 when i ask him about what happened in the other meeting he claims to know nothing about it and i need to speak to the other manager who conducted that interview 
 this was three months ago and today i learn that the manager that conducted the investigation meeting has now left '' 
 when i ask the reason why he left the person who told me just said well if he had n't have left we would have <unk> him leave '' 
 the incident i experienced with him might have had an effect on his employment 
 there 's always a chance but i will never <unk> is my first time posting so bear with me 
 so i work in a <unk> <unk> in <unk> 
 usually it 's pretty calm only had to call the cops twice this being one of them and i 've never had to personally kick anyone out 
 this happened last night at about 12 am 
 a guy walked into the bar at about 10 pm <unk> from here on out and ordered a few drinks from the bartender 
 i work the front counter so i do n't know how he acted inside the bar so i ca n't tell you much about him 
 but i do know that by the time he left at about 12 he was completely <unk> 
 the bartender comes into the <unk> <unk> part and asks me to watch the bar for him while he goes out to smoke with the guy before he leaves 
 it 's kind of a slow night so it 's no biggie i go in and watch the bar 
 a few minutes later the bartender runs in and tells me to go on the speaker and call forward someone who drove a white <unk> because their car was hit 
 apparently <unk> hit a car while on his way out of the parking lot and sped away before the bartender could get his license plate number 
 so i call them forward while the bartender calls the cops and tells them about the whole situation 
 while we 're waiting for the cops the bartender gets an idea 
 he goes into his past sales and looks up the name on the credit card <unk> used 
 he uses this name to search facebook for <unk> 
 he find his <unk> totally public and with a <unk> picture matching <unk> perfectly 
 at around 11 <unk> posted a status on facebook drinking at <unk> <unk> '' 
 and his <unk> cover was a picture of the car used to hit the <unk> 
 the bartender starts going through his pictures and comes across a picture of that same car but from the front this time totally <unk> the license plate number 
 now we have a name a face a car model and a license plate number 
 when the cop gets there the bartender gives him all this information 
 the cop thanks him does all the cop stuff that i do n't know about and now they are possibly were searching for that car trying to catch him and charge him with a <unk> and a hit and run 
 so this just goes to show do n't post everything online or at least do n't leave it public 
 or do it just might do everyone a favor if you get into trouble and could possibly save a <unk> worked in a small town fast food franchise 
 the franchise owner had his corporate office in our town we did a lot of direct contact with him 
 he 's an awesome guy <unk> on many times he does n't <unk> rude customers 
 enter construction worker cw 
 busy lunch hour lots of orders and i 'm the manager on duty 
 i step to the register me : what can i get ya today 
 cw : i want a # 7 with a coke 
 now we 're having an <unk> contest for a $ 50 gas card so i begin my spiel of we have other sides besides french fries for <unk> more you can get <unk> rings <unk> <unk> or a side salad '' 
 cw <unk> his voice slams his hand on the counter and says i just want my fucking fries '' 
 at first i was stunned 
 and then mad 
 no one deserves to be yelled at especially over fries 
 so i stop his transaction and smile me : i 'm sorry sir i do n't have to take that language and attitude 
 you can get your food somewhere else i 'm not serving you 
 cw : are you serious 
 you ca n't do that 
 me : yes i actually can 
 i can refuse service to anyone and you are n't eating here 
 cw : i know the owner small town i hear this all the time i 'm going to give him a ring and let him know you refused me 
 me : would you like his cell phone number 
 cause that 's the number i was going to call to let him know you cussed at me and demanded effing '' french fries 
 cw walked out my co workers were shocked and the lady behind him clapped 
 i immediately called the owner to let him know what happened and with plenty of witnesses i never even worried about <unk> 
 it was a good day to say the <unk> ive mentioned before i work in a generic supply store located if a mildly <unk> area 
 so its pretty natural that we receive a lot of self entitled customers 
 so we get various different types of pricks but one that <unk> me more than most is simply the lazy fuckers 
 again these people are self entitled and lazy and they believe that low payed retail employees are there to answer to their every beck and call 
 so we occasionally get these customers that will just hand us a <unk> of paper with a few things scrawled on it and they expect us to do there shopping for them 
 out of the lot of them there was this one particular woman who would come in and give us this stunt 
 she was a fairly regular customer so i had learned to avoid her whenever she came shes one of those customers we just <unk> <unk> off onto the new guys and let them deal with her 
 however one night several months ago here she comes in we 'll call her lazy woman <unk> with the same smug look on her face as always 
 however it had been quite the day and my normally pleasant <unk> was pretty much <unk> 
 it was nothing personal it had just been a very long shift with several annoying customers and i had just been worn thin 
 so anyways its probably 4 or 5 minutes to close when <unk> comes in 
 at this point at night im not thinking to hard so i just approach her 
 <unk> : hi ma'am anything we can help you find tonight <unk> : ** im looking for product x '' <unk> : thats gon na be on aisle 6 ma'am your right hand side halfway down 
 <unk> : ** thats nice ill wait here while you go get that for me she then proceeds to start <unk> with here phone 
 this was pretty much breaking point for me i had been there for close to 9 hours i had been dealing with crazy customers all day and i really didnt want to be made into this self entitled bitches ... well bitch 
 so i gave her my condescending go fuck yourself look '' and told her <unk> : um ... yeah no 
 go get it yourself 
 <unk> : ** excuse me 
 <unk> : you got 4 working <unk> get it your damn self 
 <unk> : ** well i never 
 she got pretty pissed pretty quick shes is already beat red here i demand to see your manager 
 <unk> : certainly 
 hey manager <unk> **m : ** hi ma ... <unk> cut <unk> <unk> : ** your employee said <unk> cuts her <unk> **m : ** ma'am im well aware of what just happened i saw the whole thing 
 <unk> : ** well <unk> you gon na do something about it 
 **m : ** yes i am actually ma'am leave my store <unk> : ** eh but ... **m : ** ma'am the store is closed now and i want you off the premises immediately 
 at this point i should point out that this particular manager is about <unk> and probably <unk> close to <unk> pounds this is a big dude 
 and the bitch in question if <unk> at the most and in her late 40 's 
 not a lot she can really do against him 
 she gives the both of us a look to kill and leaves the store 
 the manager begins to laugh his ass off 
 the tale eventually made its way back around to the store manager himself who told all of us that in an event like that were simply to walk away and leave the customer standing there 
 the point of the story is that employees <unk> your personal <unk> they 're normal people who work a minimum wage job and honestly dont give a shit about you your needs 
 leave them alone ask a question get your shit and get out 
 if you really need help we are more than happy to oblige but dont be a total prick about it cause angry minimum wage employees can make you really <unk> 've been working at a movie theater for about 6 months now and i just got a customer worth posting about 
 one day an elderly lady came in with her daughter and two grandchildren they bought tickets to a <unk> movie and of course i double checked saying this showing will be in <unk> is that okay '' 
 after saying yes they proceeded into their movie 
 after about 40 minutes the grandmother came back out to the lobby and asked why the screen is <unk> 
 confused on why no one had come out to complain earlier i asked if she ha been wearing her <unk> glasses 
 as i 'm sure you know without the glasses it just looks <unk> 
 she said no because she did n't want to wear them 
 i explained that the movie will be <unk> if she does n't wear the glasses 
 she said that it 's unacceptable to run a movie <unk> and asked to speak to a manager 
 i called a manager for her and he reiterated what i had said and offered her a refund on the ticket 
 she refused and returned to her movie 
 i went back to preparing for the next round of movies but she was n't done with us quite yet 
 she returned to the lobby demanding we turn the <unk> off '' 
 i told her i could n't do that because the rest of the customers had paid to see the film in <unk> she began to yell rather rude things to me which <unk> in her throwing her <unk> glasses at me gathering her family and leaving the theater early 
 i explained to my manager what happened in case she called to complain 
 edit : i was dumb and did n't actually know how <unk> <unk> customer walked in i smiled and said good morning and he just stared at me so that was my <unk> he was n't going to be very pleasant 
 when he came through my line a few minutes later with a couple small items he proved my theory to be true 
 & gt me : is that everything for you 
 & gt grumpy : <unk> at me* & gt me : okay ... would like a bag for it 
 & gt grumpy : no 
 & gt me : alrighty 
 your total is $ xx.xx he pays and i go to hand him his receipt 
 & gt grumpy : *blank stare* where 's my bag 
 & gt me : you said you did n't want one ... & gt grumpy : well i changed my mind 
 & gt me : well you never told me so i did n't know 
 i bagged his items and wished him a good day and he left mumbling something about incompetent women '' 
 <unk> i may cry i was 20 minutes into typing this post up when a power <unk> hit and every thing at work went down including the computer and now i have to type this again 
 that in itself may become another <unk> <unk> : standard stuff 
 first time post massive wall of text etc 
 background : i work at a small <unk> owned <unk> game store 
 you name it i have something for it 
 now this tale takes place a few days after gta 5 came out 
 you see on this slow day at work i was killing time doing what i usually do : playing <unk> games on one of our displays 
 on the rare occasion when a customer would come in i 'd pause my game greet them and offer whatever help i could provide then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store 
 now it had been an hour or so since i had last had anyone in the store so i was <unk> to sell something when mom and kid came in 
 i jumped up and gave them my spiel and they assured me they were fine and were just looking 
 well a few minutes go by when kid and mom come up to me with you guessed it gta 5 in hand 
 kid has that look of pure <unk> on his face 
 the one where you just know he is <unk> the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is <unk> running over <unk> and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun 
 except there is one thing between him and that future 
 a fell and <unk> guardian 
 that would be me 
 i should take this time to mention that for the most part i do n't like telling people they ca n't buy something 
 it is sad not only because i 'm missing out on a sale but i 'm also a <unk> and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you 
 your card was declined '' you have to be 17 or older to buy this '' etc are phrases i <unk> 
 except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world 
 for you the entitled the bratty the <unk> the assholes the pricks the <unk> the <unk> etc 
 to you i find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its <unk> 
 back to the story 
 so whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a m rated game i am required by law to ask for an id or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen 
 now most parents fall into one of two general <unk> : the i do n't care i just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money '' type and the i 'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and i 'm totally cool with it now take my money '' type 
 those are the ones that just say yes and having done my duty and covering my ass legally i move on and make the sale 
 not mom 
 no when i tell her about the m rating she actually stops and asks me why its m rated 
 my heart stopped 
 i heard <unk> and <unk> and that little tone we all know and love when mario picks up a coin 
 this honestly never happens 
 i 've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed 
 kid 's heart drops at this 
 but you can still see hope in his eyes hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming dude ... be cool '' 
 nope 
 i like my job and i like to think i do it well 
 i 'm paid to play and talk about games from the <unk> on up to the ps4 and xbox one <unk> 
 so when someone asks me about a game i 'm going to tell you every thing about it 
 and thats just what mom gets 
 first blow : language 
 mom 's approval does n't take any visible damage kid is <unk> and <unk> mom he is mature enough to handle it 
 quick second punch : drugs and alcohol 
 i think i saw a <unk> ... <unk> mom <unk> quickly 
 kid again whispering <unk> and praise in her ear like <unk> in <unk> 
 i 'm getting serious now : violence 
 finally a crack in the <unk> 
 mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure kid <unk> wants this game and can handle it 
 kid puts on his most mature look *i swear if he had a <unk> <unk> and top hat he would have magically <unk> them at this point to complete the <unk> he does he can he could pay the damn <unk> right now he 's that mature 
 you 're doing well in keeping the situation <unk> kid but i have a secret weapon : <unk> 
 yep as some of you know gta 5 did n't get the <unk> <unk> rating that could <unk> as anything from some <unk> ankle to side <unk> 
 nope 
 now this is what kid feared was coming and hoped i either did n't know or was n't going to share it but i did 
 critical hit 
 <unk> 
 mom was out 
 she refused to get it and told kid he was n't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough 
 i thought that was the end of it but damn kid was quick on his feet 
 he played the friends already have it '' card followed quickly by dad will be okay with it call him '' 
 so she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him meanwhile i 'm left in the store getting the most <unk> filled look i 've seen 
 seriously i think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me 
 not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff 
 oh no i mean slow and painful years of <unk> kind 
 well mom comes back in and is on the fence again 
 apparently dad was n't against it but she still was 
 i 'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what i told her and i do and mom gets the phone back 
 this time she stays in the store and i must have convinced dad because this time she hangs up and tells kid he is not getting the game 
 reddit let me tell you i have seen some tantrums <unk> complete personality turn <unk> etc in my time but damn 
 kid takes the cake 
 all <unk> of <unk> <unk> out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book 
 he screams he threatens he cries he begs every thing 
 i would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes so i 'll just give you my three favorite parts because i can remember those nearly verbatim 
 favorite 1 : kid is in that state where he <unk> from rage to bawling <unk> but is <unk> and <unk> and generally <unk> me out the entire <unk> 
 why is this hilarious 
 because while doing all this he is telling mom that he is mature enough to handle the game and that the <unk> is n't even a main part of it and he wo n't look at it and he does n't have to do it etc 
 except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission 
 so yeah 
 also the tantrum <unk> 
 not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something favorite 2 : the <unk> has it so screw you i 'll just play it there '' 
 now kudos to mom she handled this like a pro 
 her response you wo n't when i call every one of your friends parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game 
 i 'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing '' favorite 3 : this one was just stupid which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious 
 kid yells at mom telling her he does n't need her and he 'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself 
 mom not <unk> or even looking at me asks me if he could buy it without her 
 to help her get her point across i ask if he is 17 she <unk> me he is n't and i tell them that without an id <unk> he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game 
 the night ends with her dragging his bawling snot dripping raging ass out of my store apologizing profusely for his <unk> and before they get out of <unk> i can hear her list off the <unk> list of <unk> he 's going to recieve after his behavior 
 reddit i love moments like that 
 it had it all : drama laughter lies <unk> threats crying <unk> and a parent actually acting like a parent 
 oh and kid was about 15 by the way 
 be honest you all thought he was 10 did n't you 
 i 've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more 
 tl : dr you guys are <unk> ... <unk> 
 kid <unk> mom refuses to <unk> last night working a night shift and a particularly popular small <unk> station 
 i was busy ringing up a lady 's food <unk> scanning it through with the usual retail <unk> when this drunk guy in the queue pipes up 
 & gt me : have you got any petrol at all '' 
 & gt lady : no thanks just these '' & gt me no worries altogether it 's <unk> '' & gt lady : <unk> i think i have the change '' normally if the queue was any longer than 1 person i 'd ring for another assistant but as it was just one guy i just let him wait all of 30 seconds <unk> the lady get the change whilst i carry on packing her stuff into a <unk> & gt drunk guy : could you just hurry up '' for those of us who have worked at 9 hour night shift our energy and patience <unk> a fuck <unk> more than during the day so i calmly said : & gt '' give me just three seconds i 'm with a customer '' & gt drunk guy : i 've already been waiting 2 minutes '' & gt me : then you do n't mind waiting 2 seconds '' & gt directed at lady sorry about that '' & gt lady : no do n't be i 'd say the same '' after she had left he handed his cheap beer over and paid without saying a <unk> while back when i was sixteen i had taken a job at a local grocery store 
 i lived in a small town and even through the store was quite small it was the largest one in the county 
 i had nearly worked for two months at the local grocery store when this occurrence had happened 
 i was <unk> the end of my shift on a saturday afternoon it had n't been a particularly day despite it being a weekend and i can recall myself quite bored when the old man walked into the store 
 the old man who 's name i will change for the sake of the story to <unk> had been a regular customer spending a few hundred dollars a week 
 he was usually <unk> and <unk> but today he was <unk> and <unk> 
 how are you doing sir '' 
 i asked from behind the counter 
 ok its been a long day '' 
 <unk> replied without his usual cheer 
 he then shuffled away into the aisles 
 minutes passed and i waited patiently in the seat which was <unk> behind the cash register but after awhile i went to look for him to see if he needed any assistance 
 i <unk> the store caressing <unk> aisles with a looking eye when i finally found him in the far right corner looking at the <unk> merchandise we carried which consisted of rope a few cheap tents bug spray and various other things you 'd need to bring for a typical night of camping 
 <unk> had a <unk> twelve pack of beer in one hand and was the examining the different ropes with another 
 hello <unk> '' 
 i said 
 the store staff were quite friendly with the old man or at least enough that we called him by his first name 
 do you need help with anything '' 
 which rope do you think is the strongest '' 
 there were only four different of rope and i honestly had completely no clue which one was the most <unk> so i picked at random pointing at a blue one 
 then he gave me a measurement and i cut the certain length then took the rope to the cash register so he could pay 
 <unk> followed slowly a <unk> <unk> 
 the receipt took a while to print the printer was old and <unk> and so after i had scanned the rope and beer i tried to <unk> with <unk> 
 i looked at the rope and the <unk> expression on the old man 's face 
 are you sure everything is ok '' 
 could be better could be worse '' 
 <unk> said with <unk> tone 
 alright then '' i said smiling '' here 's your receipt '' 
 as he walked out of the store i went to my manager 
 i told him of the recent occurrence and he was slightly concerned 
 <unk> was a regular customer spent a lot of money in the store and also was the owner 's good friend 
 so due to the fact that <unk> lived about a block away the manager had the bright idea of sending me out to monitor the old man 
 i <unk> at first but gave when i realized that i 'd be basically getting paid to watch a house but what i could possibly do to prevent a suicide was beyond me 
 i walked out of the store with a hoodie on it was <unk> spring but it was still <unk> outside 
 my breath <unk> <unk> in the air 
 i walked down the street trailing <unk> feeling like a total moron 
 fortunately i had an <unk> player in my pocket so i could listen to music while doing my detective research 
 after two corners <unk> 's house was in sight and i decided to wait it out on a bench in front of a auto store about 50 yards away from the <unk> <unk> house 
 ten minutes passed without anything <unk> then fifteen minutes twenty minutes but after about maybe 25 minutes i saw <unk> 
 the old man 's <unk> was surrounded by a tall wooden fence and had a huge <unk> <unk> tree in the middle 
 <unk> was <unk> up the tree 's broad <unk> with the blue rope <unk> around his arm 
 when he reached the middle branch he stopped and tied an end of the rope around it in a wide <unk> 
 he then <unk> back down the <unk> and disappeared behind the wooden fence 
 another bout of minutes passed i felt a nervous <unk> of expected excitement in my chest the rope glared at me like an <unk> <unk> 
 the afternoon sun was setting and it <unk> over <unk> 's house with a glaring tint 
 i had to <unk> my eyes at the house and even then it was hard to see 
 the sun continued to decline it grew <unk> and i grew more <unk> with every moment 
 the blue rope <unk> in a slight breeze 
 finally a figure appeared two figures actually to stand on top of the fence frame 
 one the <unk> frame of a young girl the other of the old man 
 <unk> had the rope held in his hand but quickly put it around the girls ... neck 
 i could n't tell with the distance but the way the girl was shaking shrieked of approaching disaster 
 was <unk> hanging a child 
 i stood up abruptly yanking out my ear <unk> with a <unk> <unk> of my hand and began to <unk> toward the house 
 everything was as if it was in slow motion my feet speeding forward faster than i ever think they 've gone before <unk> shoving the girl of the top of the fence connected to the rope tied to the branch of the <unk> tree 
 holy hell '' 
 i shouted 
 a scream sounded from the other side of the fence and the rope went slack 
 i <unk> the wooden fence with an <unk> <unk> landing on the other side with a heavy <unk> 
 i once again stood up scanning the <unk> lawn with <unk> eyes 
 there was <unk> standing on top of the fence smiling down at the frame of the girl who ... held the <unk> blue rope in her hands 
 two other girls were standing underneath the tree yelling words of <unk> but they stopped abruptly when they saw the sight of me a <unk> teenager with eyes <unk> with adrenaline 
 i stared at them awkwardly then turned to <unk> and apologized profusely 
 it turns out those were his grand kids and he was caring for them for the weekend 
 the reason he had looked so <unk> and <unk> was because well he had been caring for three grand kids for the weekend 
 the rope was used for a rope swing to <unk> his <unk> 
 after i told why i had so <unk> appeared in his back lawn he laughed almost as profusely as i had apologized 
 it became a joke between us and the store and the story was told for years <unk> worked in the deli for a major supermarket in canada for a few years 
 one very important thing we had to do hourly was temperature checks 
 food in the hot case had to be at or above a certain temperature and could only be out for a set number of hours 
 i 've got 2 quick stories about new girls i had the pleasure of training 
 * training a cute girl who did n't seem too bright but there 's not much to the <unk> chicken business anyway 
 she was going to school to be an <unk> / <unk> so i figured she 'd be on board with safety and keeping records accurate temperature logs 
 - nope - she claimed to be <unk> and as such could n't read an <unk> clock and keeping logs were an issue 
 red flag for food safety super red flag for getting the right <unk> of medicine 
 also we had to <unk> raw whole chickens stick them on racks and throw them in an oven 
 this was too gross '' for her and she was n't going to do it 
 not sure if she got the part in her <unk> class about elderly care and gross things one will need to <unk> 
 she did n't make it to the end of the week 
 * we hired another <unk> girl to replace her 
 this was her first job but she was taking in everything asking the right questions and taking notes 
 i told her about the girl who could n't read an <unk> clock 
 well this girl could n't read an <unk> clock either but did n't say anything to me at the time 
 i only found out a few days later that she went home and spent a few hours with her mom learning how to do so 
 that was cool of her not to just give up 
 kids these days man 
 my grandad just told me this and i thought you 'd all enjoy a crazy customer story through the eyes of a customer 
 i 'll tell it from his point of view 
 so i was trying on some <unk> that were on sale they were a really good bargain so it was busy 
 i hung my jacket on a <unk> so it would n't get dirty on the floor and turned away to look at the racks 
 when i turned back some guy was trying on my jacket 
 my jacket 
 i said excuse me that 's my jacket '' 
 but the guy says no it 's not you 're trying on the <unk> '' that is my jacket my phone is in the pocket '' 
 well you could have just put it there to hold it but you ca n't do that while you 're trying on something else so i 'm taking it '' 
 at this point i 've had enough and i want my damn jacket back so i shout at the him look mate i 've had a shit day and i just want to do my shopping in peace 
 the government has just taken all my money and now you 're trying to take the clothes off my back 
 it is my fucking jacket with my fucking phone in the pocket so give it back before this becomes a problem '' 
 my grandad is a <unk> old 6'5 badass everyone is looking now so the guy gives me my jacket back but he still follows me out the door before he 's certain i was trying to steal his bargain '' 
 tldr : crazy old <unk> guys 
 short story about when i first started 
 i had a trainee name tag for about 4 months 
 i was the only trainee to have said name tag even though there were those hired at the same time and after me 
 they got normal names 
 i got trainee '' 
 so i 'd often get people talking <unk> to me and telling me '' you 'll get it right eventually '' 
 gee thanks but i 've been here for months now ... a couple people would always stop stare and ask if trainee '' was really my name 
 and every time i 'd answer this is an honored family name passed down through <unk> 
 my name is trainee is there anything else i can get for you '' 
 then they 'd look at me for a bit get it then laugh 
 then i 'd tell them nah mate i 'm firelight2 '' 
 i got a lot of <unk> for being <unk> ... <unk> work in a popular british <unk> style shop 
 this happened to me this morning 
 it 's boxing day which means boxing day sales 
 actually not terrible discounts i picked up a few things myself 
 fortunately the shop i work at is in a small village maybe only a few hundred people living there so we were n't very busy today 
 about half an hour before we closed a woman comes in and heads straight to the back of the shop to where our books are kept 
 as we did n't expect to be busy only myself and the assistant manager are in and we 're stood by the tills talking about <unk> we plan on seeing next year 
 twenty five minutes later five minutes before we close he goes through to the back turns off most of the lights and comes back onto the shop floor to let any remaining customers know that we 're closing soon 
 come closing time the only customer left is this woman who walks up to the till with her arms full of books 
 i scan them all through and after multiple <unk> etc 
 offers it totals at just over <unk> 
 she then hands me a voucher 
 c = customer m = me am = assistant manager c : i 've got these vouchers i want to use they should cover it 
 *i take the vouchers and on the front in big text it clearly says 20 % off ink cartridges next time you shop '' * m : i 'm sorry but these vouchers are only valid for ink cartridges not books 
 do you still want the books or <unk> c : but it says 20 % off 
 ca n't i give you five vouchers and get the books for free 
 m : no i 'm afraid not it says on the vouchers here that they 're only valid on ink cartridges not books 
 c : what 
 let me see 
 *she snatches the vouchers out of my hands 
 at this point the am walks away because he does n't have a filter when it comes to stupid <unk> c : it does n't say anywhere on here that you ca n't use them on books 
 m : well no but that 's because it says tha- c : this is stupid i should get these for free 
 **i want to speak to a <unk> *i sigh and call the am back over and try to explain the <unk> m : am this customer is upset that she ca n't use her ink <unk> <unk> c : i have five 20 % off vouchers here that means i can get this for free 
 am : ... are you being serious 
 c : this idiot keeps telling me that it 's only for ink but it does n't say anything about not being able to use it for books 
 am : can i see the voucher quickly 
 *she hands one <unk> am : ah you 're right it does n't say you ca n't use it on books 
 actually it does n't say you ca n't use it at the supermarket down the road either 
 why do n't you try there we 're <unk> am a cashier at a pretty big craft store 
 we have a major competitor but their closest store is almost 20 mins away 
 this is relevant to the story 
 anyways i 'm ringing up a few purchases from a group of <unk> women 
 one of them asks me if we have any online coupons and i tell her to just google search store name coupon and it will pull right up 
 a few seconds later she shows me her phone screen and she has pulled up a coupon for competitor 
 c = the customer 
 me : oh i 'm sorry ma'am i can not accept coupons from other stores 
 c : what do you mean 
 me : that coupon is for competitor so unfortunately i can not use it on your purchase 
 c : well i do n't see why not 
 you should be able to take this coupon 
 me : i 'm sorry i can only accept coupons for store name not for competitor 
 c : what do you mean 
 this is competitor 
 at this point it is important to note that almost everything in our store is branded my <unk> and shirt both have the store name on them and there are signs with our store name hung up all over the sales floor 
 me : uhh ... no ma'am i 'm sorry but this is store name not competitor 
 c : no 
 me showing her my <unk> : see it says right here this is store name 
 <unk> retail smile* c : **this is competitor 
 ** me : ma'am i 'm not sure what else to tell you but i can promise you this is store name 
 your total will be $ xx.xx today 
 c paying while continuing to glare at me : this is competitor 
 i do not shop at store name 
 me handing her the items and change : have a nice rest of your day ma'am 
 c : it says competitor outside you 'll see 
 and then she walked out 
 i have people show me wrong coupons a lot but most of them know where they 're shopping 
 i do n't know how you miss something like <unk> 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 **story : ** i had a customer call a month ago to complain about some fireworks 
 the customer was <unk> and the call was being conducted through a <unk> device using an <unk> 
 if you 've never <unk> over a <unk> through an <unk> it can be <unk> and i feel terrible for the hearing <unk> people who have to use one 
 basically you tell the <unk> whatever <unk> like to say making sure to speak slowly 
 the <unk> types your end of the conversation on a keyboard and then sends it to the hearing <unk> user 
 the user then reads the message types in their reply and sends it back to the <unk> 
 the <unk> then reads the reply back to you 
 sometimes it can take minute or two for all this to happen so you’re basically saying a couple of <unk> or asking a question waiting for a minute or two to hear the reply and then speaking again 
 it 's like having a conversation in slow motion with someone on the <unk> 
 apparently the caller had purchased some fireworks from me in <unk> and was mad because some of them did n't work 
 i give an <unk> money back guarantee on everything i sell and i always feel terrible when someone has issues with my stuff 
 i apologized profusely and since my store is seasonal and had already closed i offered to send him a check to refund his purchase 
 normally i’d want to see a receipt or have them bring back the <unk> but because of the <unk> <unk> already been on the phone for more than 20 minutes at that point 
 i felt bad for the guy and just wanted to finish the call and make him happy 
 ** two minutes later - <unk> delay ** unfortunately that was n't the answer he was looking for 
 instead he wanted me to replace his fireworks 
 i offered to meet him somewhere and bring him <unk> 
 ** two minutes later ** i was informed that he lived an hour away and couldn’t get over to orlando 
 instead he wanted me to mail him the fireworks 
 now fireworks are considered <unk> materials and ca n't be shipped through the regular mail 
 because of the <unk> and problems associated with this i do n't ship fireworks 
 i let him know that and again offered to send him a check to cover the <unk> 
 ** two minutes later ** i was again told that i needed to mail him fireworks since i had a guarantee and the fireworks he had purchased were bad 
 once again i explained to the <unk> that i didn’t mail fireworks but that i’d be happy to send a check 
 ** two minutes later ** he’s now really mad at me and yelling that i can send him a check and <unk> go to another fireworks company to get his stuff 
 i only know that he was yelling because the <unk> <unk> informed me that he was typing <unk> 
 that’s <unk> was being yelled at by a hearing <unk> person over the phone through an <unk> <unk> the call 
 i asked him to give me a list of exactly what fireworks were <unk> so i could figure out the cost and mail him a check 
 i also told him that i would need his home address 
 ** two minutes later ** it’s a box of firecrackers 
 a f*cking $ <unk> box of firecrackers 
 i had now spent 30 minutes on the phone because this ass was unhappy that <unk> of the <unk> in his pack did not pop more than two months after he had purchased them 
 i immediately sent him a check for $ 20 through online banking 
 i filled out the note field on the check 
 it read <unk> shop somewhere <unk> 
 unfortunately it can take up to 8 days for the check to arrive when it’s a new entry online 
 the bastard called me back every day until he got the check 
 when the <unk> <unk> would <unk> themselves i would just say <unk> check is in the <unk> and hang up 
 -- -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here alright so kids are very annoying when it comes to checking out 
 always in the way blocking the sensor climbing on the bag <unk> thing ... i 'm always afraid i 'm going to hit one of them in the head with it and guess what 
 i finally did 
 this young boy did everything i described above and more 
 however he was also <unk> into the thing that the bags are on that i spin towards the customers 
 i did not see him there being obnoxious and i spun it so i could move on to the next bag and it hit him in the head 
 holy crap 
 my heart just about stopped as i thought to myself that i was in a shit ton of trouble right there 
 the parents however surprised me by telling him it was his own fault and that he needs to get out of my way 
 oh that made my day.so i 'm at work at my auto part store trying my <unk> not to kill the many idiots that we get 
 so this lady comes in yo the store well she was dressed like a lady but you could tell it was a guy in drag 
 now we do n't get many people like that but i have had a few run ins so i 'm not really surprised or even care 
 so she comes up to the counter and asks for some power <unk> fluid 
 i go and grab it for her and ring it up 
 she then asks me if i could help put the fluid in for her and i said sure why not 
 so we go to the car and while i 'm opening up the hood we make small talk 
 right when i finish she takes out a $ 20 bill and tries to give it to me 
 i tell her i ca n't accept tips but if she did that customer survey it would help me out more 
 she agrees and then asks why i treated her normal 
 i get what she meant and i just tell her honestly i do n't care how you look ma'am we all deserve to be treated the same no matter how you look '' 
 she thanked me and gave me a hug which felt weird cause i do n't usually get hugs from strangers and then she just puts the $ 20 in my shirt pocket and leaves 
 it made me feel happy knowing that i made her day by just being casual 
 my coworker then asked me if that was a dude and i just responded with it does n't matter all customers look the same to me and smiled 
 and with that i felt good and made today a good day until 30 seconds later i get another idiot trying to buy washer fluid to put in his <unk> was just a normal customer in this situation but found it to be annoying none the less 
 today my fiance and i got breakfast and <unk> at a popular bread cafe in town 
 while we were in line waiting to order there was an old lady in front of us demanding her money back because - <unk> - she thought it was too cold in the restaurant 
 she was holding an empty cup that was clearly meant for a frozen drink and berated the manager for the temperature claiming that she could n't even sit in there long enough to finish her drink '' because of how <unk> it was 
 a younger woman either daughter or granddaughter i 'm guessing came up to her and told her they were ready '' and were going to the car to which the woman responded wait a minute i 'm getting my money back for this drink '' 
 clearly she did finish her drink and had been there with her family for quite a while 
 not only did the manager refund her money but he also turned the heat up in the restaurant 
 long after she was gone it was still <unk> inside 
 i could n't help but laugh later when a customer sitting at a nearby table looked over to us and asked is it <unk> in here to you 
 this happened a few years back when i used to manage a small grooming salon 
 we had one customer who i hated 
 she was a <unk> tiny elderly lady who owned a little dog 
 every <unk> time she called to make a booking to get her dog <unk> the times available were never to her liking and she would throw a tantrum like a three year old until we just gave up and let her have her own damn way 
 well one day she called up and i ended up completely <unk> the entire days schedule to suit her sorry butt 
 i was none too pleased and consequently <unk> her <unk> '' in the booking system 
 anywho 
 her appointment time comes and goes and <unk> does n't show up 
 i 'm <unk> 
 a coworker asks me where she is and i spit maybe she 's dead and her dog has <unk> her <unk> '' 
 coworker tells me i 'm <unk> and horrible and we forget about it 
 fast forward a week later and i recieve a phone call from my coworker 
 she 's upset with me 
 apparently <unk> family had come into the shop with sad news 
 <unk> had passed away and my coworker being the <unk> person she was believed i had somehow cursed her 
 the only curse here is my big fat mouth and awful sense of <unk> so this happened today before i left work 
 guy comes in and starts taking a bunch of tools 
 i mean this dude was not being subtle 
 so i came up to him asking if he was ready to pay for those parts and just bolts to the door making the alarm go off 
 now at that moment when he was stealing two cops show up and are heading toward the store 
 the shoplifter gets to the door and sees the cops and just stays frozen there 
 i come out and tell the cops that he was shoplifting 
 they grab him and <unk> him 
 they find about $ 100 worth of stuff 
 they arrest him and put him the <unk> car 
 man talk about having the worst <unk> ever.i 've been at this large 24/7 retail store for a couple years 
 i was for almost a year a department manager but i stepped down because of school and i simply did n't enjoy the pressure i was under for a dollar raise 
 i <unk> management my schedule they told me it would be ok '' 
 so when i see my schedule says i 'm scheduled to work during my school hours i get mad 
 i go to my manager and tell him man you forgot to update my schedule or something '' 
 no <unk> he says he just forgot and he promises he 'll change it asap 
 you can see where this is going 
 he does n't change it and i 'm still scheduled for working during school hours 
 i 'm furious now and go to our store manager big boss 
 i hate dealing with the big boss i really do 
 he 's not friendly and he 's basically a corporate <unk> and a typical rich conservative 
 i tell him the problem and he says sorry <unk> but we 're not going to work around your schedule 
 we need you for those shifts '' 
 no problem i tell him i 'll just call out and keep doing it till they change my schedule 
 then we 'll just have to <unk> you out of the system '' yep i take off my badge and say i 'll save you the effort of firing me i quit '' 
 i walk out and as i 'm heading towards the front i hear him page me to the <unk> 
 i head back there i have no idea what he wants and i do n't care 
 i walk in and big boss is at the door <unk> please <unk> 
 we 'll work around your schedule just please do n't quit 
 we seriously need you we 're too badly understaffed 
 theres nobody else in your department 
 i 'll change your schedule now sir '' 
 <unk> 
 i called their <unk> and now i have them begging me to come back 
 as far as i know for the rest of the month my schedule is fixed 
 they 've reduced my hours like i asked and gave me the morning shifts again 
 management has also been extra friendly to me lately 
 feels good man 
 long time lurker first time poster 
 anyway when i was in highschool i worked as a junior <unk> at a small garage in southern <unk> 
 one day we had a guy call in and tell us he needed his clutch replaced 
 i 'll call him <unk> 
 i was like no problem man 
 bring the car in at three and we 'll get it done right quick '' 
 so the guy brings his car in and we start to raise it up on the lift 
 my boss looks at the <unk> of the car and lets out this long whistle 
 turns out <unk> had in his attempt to replace the clutch himself removed literally every bolt and screw from the <unk> of his car 
 every 
 single 
 one 
 after digging around for about 5 minutes we determined that <unk> had ruined his <unk> with his <unk> bolt <unk> 
 when i break the news to him he goes dead pale 
 he just stares at me for a minute and then says my wife told me i was gon na break something ... she 's never gon na let me live this down '' 
 i tell him the it 's gon na cost about $ <unk> to replace both the <unk> and the clutch and it 's like a switch is flicked inside his head 
 $ <unk> eh 
 i can do that ... yeah that 'll be fine 
 i 'm gon na pay for all the work right now in cash '' 
 i 'm just staring at <unk> as he <unk> back and forth gears in his head spinning like crazy 
 suddenly he stops and turns to me 
 do n't tell my wife '' 
 he says looking me dead in the eyes 
 i just stare at him for a second before saying sure thing man '' 
 he shakes my hand as vigorously as is <unk> possible before running actually running to the front of the store to pay for the work 
 when <unk> and his wife come back later to pick up the car he looks at his wife then the car and then he gives me this long slow wink 
 like he 's the <unk> criminal of all time 
 i almost spit my coffee half way across the room 
 anyway he got his car drove off and lived happily ever after 
 not exactly a tale from retail '' but i thought you guys might enjoy it 
 edit : the guy brought in a clutch kit that he had purchased from another garage 
 which is why the work was $ <unk> instead of $ 1300 
 sorry for any confusion or raised hopes of super cheap <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> : good morning parts warehouse phone guy : hi i 'm looking for a belt me : sure what are the <unk> <unk> : i do n't know manager knows though me : i 'm sorry he 's busy at the moment 
 <unk> : well i 'll wait 
 so i put him on hold and wait for manager to finish up 
 me : hey i have <unk> on the phone and he says you know the <unk> for his belt 
 manager : i have no idea who that is 
 me : hey <unk> manager does n't know them 
 <unk> : well i know the serial number on my <unk> 
 me : i do n't have a cross reference to look that up 
 <unk> : well it 's a <unk> and <unk> belt 
 me : i ca n't look anything up that way either i really need the <unk> for it because we make our own 
 we do n't carry <unk> numbers 
 <unk> : well just look but part number <unk> me : i ca n't that 's not one of our part numbers and i ca n't cross over on <unk> 
 <unk> : well type it into your magic internet and look it up 
 me : i just did and nothing comes up 
 <unk> : well baby i guess you need to put me through to manager 
 i put him on hold 
 me : manager <unk> wants to talk to you 
 any he called me baby 
 manager picks up the phone : stop sexually harassing my employees 
 what do you need ... i do n't have it 
 and hangs up 
 walks away and does n't say another word about <unk> i was 16 i had a job at <unk> pizza place 
 our particular store only did dine in and carry out no delivery 
 people working on the floor were allowed to wear any kind of black long pants they wanted with their <unk> oversized work shirt 
 when i say <unk> oversized i mean their small fit me like any other shirt would if it was sized <unk> 
 so i almost always wore black skinny jeans to not feel like i was drowning in clothing 
 i was a <unk> and i had only been working there about a month when this story happened 
 we were never busy and it was a good day if i took home more than $ 12 at the end of my shift 
 on a particularly slow day a young boy about my age and an older man his father 
 came in and were seated in my section 
 the old man was creepy from the start 
 the first thing he did was interrupt my <unk> welcome speech with you could say anything out that pretty mouth and i 'd buy it '' <unk> ... ok 
 here are our specials i 'll leave you to decide '' so i quickly <unk> away and waited for them to flag me so i could take their order 
 that went without incident as i think the boy reprimanded his father 
 he was staring at him intensely the whole time i was there 
 i brought out their food and the father knocked down his <unk> 
 ok no problem i 'll just grab that for you and get you another 
 as i bend down he whistles and as i 'm starting to walk away he says <unk> it 's nice they let you wear those little skinny pants ... <unk> it tight for us huh baby girl '' 
 y'all 
 i have been the subject of <unk> before 
 i have been literally chased in the mall 
 but i never expected someone so much older to be so lewd and disgusting at my place of work 
 it was not ok. i did n't know what to do so i froze and <unk> away 
 i told my manager she was the scum of the earth worn from nearly 40 years managing this particular <unk> pizza place who just flat out ignored me 
 i brought them their check and made no eye contact nor did i talk to them 
 the last thing he said when i was leaving their table after bringing back their credit card was oh wow i think we broke her '' 
 no asshat you didnt break me you disgusted me you sour ass wipe i hope your son told your wife and she 's left you for someone who is capable of even an <unk> of respect for women 
 <unk> **edit : ** i did n't think this would <unk> so much attention 
 i 'm glad it was actually a really creepy thing and not just in my head 
 also i did n't even think of the possibility of mental illness or a brain <unk> so i actually feel a little better 
 the chased around the mall '' story has been asked about a little bit so i 'll post it separately <unk> in advance for formatting i 'm on my phone 
 i work in a popular asian market in a <unk> area that tends to somehow cater to middle aged white ladies who want to buy asian <unk> '' <unk> and ingredients to look more <unk> 
 because of this everything is a lot more like a grocery store you 'd find in the us and it 's heavily aimed at our <unk> customer base short of the actual products we sell 
 but hey it 's a good job 
 this takes place months ago 
 we have a strict policy when it comes to cash back 
 customers must write their <unk> near the cash back amount in the receipt after receiving their money 
 this way we make sure they got their cash and if they come back complaining they did n't get it we can look at the receipt and see if they <unk> or not instead of <unk> tills in the middle of the day 
 seems simple enough right 
 not to this paranoid customer who will be called pc 
 pc comes through my line we exchange greetings everything is normal and easy 
 i bag his groceries and tell him his total 
 he uses debit and requests cash back no biggie 
 i print the receipt and hand him his cash place the receipt on the counter and hand him a pen giving my usual spiel : & gt me : ... and if you could please initial your receipt anywhere around here 
 <unk> cash back amount on receipt* & gt pc : <unk> sudden <unk> <unk> no 
 & gt me : uhh what 
 *thinking he maybe <unk> me i repeat <unk> could you please initial your receipt for cash back 
 & gt pc : i 'm not doing that 
 i 'm not legally required to give you my information 
 & gt me : uhh do n't worry 
 you 'll keep the receipt i just need you to initial it so i know you got the money 
 & gt pc : nope i 'm not signing anything 
 *reaches for receipt* & gt me : *pulls it <unk> sorry then you 're not getting your receipt 
 at this point the customers next in line are paying attention to our ridiculous argument 
 i feel a little like a parent trying to get a kid to behave in public & gt me : <unk> receipt back on counter points to where i circled <unk> please just initial here and you can keep the receipt 
 to that pc quickly snatched the paper from my hands barked out a frustrated no '' 
 and rushed out the door as quickly as possible 
 i shouted some weak comment from my register about it being against policy as he walked out but it fell short 
 oh well 
 he never came back saying he did n't have the cash so i guess it all worked out 
 he can peacefully have his receipt knowing that he did n't have to give me his valuable information by <unk> it and then taking it with him at my store we had those 30 '' high by 4 '' thick <unk> <unk> to prevent people driving vehicles into the storefront 
 what they do n't realize is that those things are <unk> about four feet into the ground and are filled with concrete as well as surrounded by concrete 
 i think we had about eight of them and they 're <unk> bright yellow of course 
 well early one sunday morning some <unk> decided that he was going to back his truck into the store at speed and steal a bunch of shit 
 we were closed on sundays so nobody noticed because he did n't even manage to set off the glass <unk> 
 monday morning cue <unk> 
 i walk up and see that one of the <unk> is bent pretty bad clock in and see that all the managers are there laughing about something 
 i go to see what 's so funny and am treated to this on video 
 guy pulls into the parking lot lines up his truck and floors it backwards toward the store 
 he <unk> one of the <unk> and his truck is popped up stopped and caught by it 
 he ca n't get away 
 fucked part is he had a <unk> and managed to take his bumper off throw it in the bed of his truck get his truck off the <unk> and <unk> before a <unk> car came around 
 it took him an hour and a half 
 never caught him but that video was <unk> tfr 
 i worked at a well known pet supply chain and this is one of the few good stories that i have to tell 
 so one of our regular customers was an elderly lady who happened to be the mother of a severely <unk> young man we 'll call him <unk> 
 <unk> was well known in the store for having <unk> where he would just sit down on the floor <unk> up into a tight ball and refuse to move 
 he never got <unk> he just sat and sometimes cried 
 i loved <unk> 
 he was the sweetest thing and his mother was always so kind 
 on this particular day i was working customer service so i was running around doing price checks carry outs etc 
 i was standing at the front waiting on a woman <unk> for nice lady to finish paying so that i could help her out to her car 
 enter <unk> and his mom 
 they walk through our first set of sliding doors no problem but <unk> is a little distracted by this dvd he has in his hands 
 he then proceeds to sit down in the middle of our second set of sliding doors blocking the way 
 his mom is doing everything she can to move <unk> but he just wo n't budge 
 he is so <unk> by the dvd in his hands that he has completely shut down to everyone 
 i see <unk> doing this and i also see the massive line of people trying to get out the front door but with a cart there is just no way around him 
 i politely tell <unk> that i will help her carry out her groceries if she will give me just a minute to handle the situation 
 she smiles politely and says no problem so i head over to the doors 
 i sat down next to <unk> and i got tons of death glares from the angry pet parents trying so desperately to leave the store 
 <unk> hey <unk> 
 <unk> got there 
 is that a new dvd 
 <unk> i love <unk> 
 <unk> oh my gosh 
 i love <unk> too 
 did your mom buy you that new i love <unk> movie 
 <unk> <unk> 
 i love <unk> 
 <unk> you know what 
 so do i. but hey 
 i have some awesome news for you 
 <unk> just kind of stared at the dvd packaging 
 <unk> we got some new cats in the adoption center 
 why do n't you ask your mom if you can go look at them 
 they are super cute and one of them will even lick your hand 
 at this point <unk> 's face absolutely lights up and he got the biggest smile on his face 
 he did n't say anything but he just <unk> up and ran over to his mom who in turn gave me the biggest most exhausted smile i have ever seen 
 she nodded her head in thanks then went about her shopping with a happy <unk> in tow 
 <unk> apparently had watched the whole situation go down 
 as i was helping her out to her car she could n't stop <unk> me for how i handled the situation 
 after i finished unloading her groceries she tried to tip me $ 5 
 i was so surprised that i almost started crying but i just told her very politely that i could n't accept tips but thank you so much for the kindness 
 that was the best day i think i might have ever had working at that stupid pet store 
 edit- oh my gosh 
 thank you guys 
 and thank you person who gave me gold 
 i <unk> the <unk> in my <unk> from all your guys responses 
 i 've only had this happen twice in the three years i 've worked in fast food yesterday and a couple months back 
 basically one customer asked if he could pay for the car behind him at drive through 
 assuming he knew the next customer i agreed and thought nothing of it 
 when the next car got to the window the woman attempted to pay so i explained to her that the car in front of her already had 
 she was confused asking who they were or why they had done it 
 realizing that it was n't someone she knew i explained how once in a great while someone will come through and offer to pay for the person behind them as a nice gesture 
 the woman looked like she was about to cry she had the biggest smile on her face 
 after <unk> over 'what a great person they were for a bit she asked if she could do the same for the car behind her 
 the <unk> it forward line lasted for the rest of the cars in drive through about 9 people payed for the person behind them 
 some of the orders were double the price of <unk> yet no one <unk> to pay it 
 it made he rest of my night just wanted to share with you guys : edit : for those of you asking the <unk> car was the last in line so he had no one to pay for 
 before paying he actually offered but glanced behind him and realized no one was there 
 he goes well 
 i guess i win then '' 
 thought it was funny : up until recently i worked at a fairly small <unk> store in <unk> 
 there are 7 of these stores all of which are in <unk> 
 now i had been working at this store for about 4 years so i know the ropes around this place 
 when we are short staffed or no manager can be found i act as <unk> 
 this story was actually one of the reasons i left my job there straw that broke the camel 's back or what have you 
 it was a sunday about a week or so ago 
 here in <unk> it was gross out : hot <unk> <unk> 
 gross 
 i was working the customer service and information desks it was a little more than an hour and a half before we close so i was tidying up the areas and just keeping busy since there was really nothing else to do 
 i hear the door open and look over 
 a lady had walked in and boy did she look upset 
 she marches over to me and i prepare for the worst 
 she begins to inform me that she has been sitting in the parking lot for 30 minutes waiting 
 i question her as to what she was waiting for 
 lady : '' some <unk> left her goddamn dogs in her car '' she shouts this probably hoping to get the person 's attention 
 i have her take me outside and show me 
 sure enough 2 <unk> are in a black car on this <unk> degree and <unk> as fuck day windows up no water <unk> 
 i walkie the one manager working today with no reply 
 i bring the lady inside and have her sit in the office while i flag our stock guy down and call the police 
 our stock boy comes up in a hurry as i am giving our address to the police i hand him a hammer and tell him to wait for my word to break the window 
 i hang up with the police get on the overhead and ask for the owner of the car to come to customer service 
 i wait 2 minutes before getting on my walkie to say <unk> <unk> is breaking the customers window police are on their way '' seconds after i walkie this i see a lady and my manager running up to my counter 
 <unk> : '' that is my f -- <unk> car dont you f -- <unk> dare break my window '' <unk> walks in with the two dogs <unk> : '' why the he -- does he have my f -- <unk> dogs 
 there was water in my car they were fine 
 you had no right to break my window i am going to sue you 
 you are so <unk> you have no idea who you are dealing with 
 i am going to call <unk> <unk> and tell him about this personally 
 he will be so angry when he finds out what you did to my car 
 you are going to be so fired 
 i will make sure you never work again 
 do you hear me 
 are you <unk> '' 
 about half way through her screaming at me i had raised my <unk> and gave a look to my manager 
 my manager says nothing 
 <unk> : '' do you really think you are allowed to just do that 
 that’s illegal 
 i will send you to jail '' 
 i give my manager one last look 
 me : '' its 90 degrees outside it is hotter in your car 
 those dogs are tiny and water is n't good enough '' <unk> : '' they are my dogs i can leave them in my car if i f -- <unk> want to 
 who are you to tell me any thing 
 you are just some stupid highschool drop out i bet having to work here the rest of your life '' manager still sits and says nothing me : '' well good new they are n't your f -- <unk> dogs anymore 
 want to sue me for the cost of the window 
 do it please i want to see the look on a judge 's face when you tell her why i broke your window 
 we allow dogs in our store why were you too lazy to bring them in 
 how would you feel when you went back out to your car and they were dead because you were to stupid to leave them at home '' manager and <unk> stare at me blankly 
 me : '' the police are on their way '' <unk> : '' ... <unk> i am just going to take my dogs and go 
 like they can find me '' me : '' do you really think i am seriously going to let you take those dogs 
 go ahead and leave you have a f -- <unk> busted out window and the police have your license plate number not going to be to hard to find you '' <unk> : '' what 
 why would you do that '' 
 me : '' i gave you a chance to come up 
 maybe if you did n't want me to call the police you should n't have left your dogs in your car '' <unk> rushes out 
 manager : '' ... <unk> was my <unk> '' me : '' nice ... very nice 
 thank you for standing up for me by the by '' manager : '' ... you know i have to write you up for swearing at her right '' 
 me : '' have fun telling <unk> store <unk> that he has to find a new cashier that is willing to do as much for as little as i <unk> '' the main store manager and our loss prevention guy both called me later that night profusely apologizing 
 edit : holy shit everyone 
 i posted this right before leaving work my <unk> is broken and my work is the only computer i really can use 
 i came into work in a bad mood and saw this and it made my morning 
 2nd edit holy shit comment of the day 
 i love all of you thank you so much 
 part 1 since the wonderful folks in this sub warned me against making the cake itself half chocolate i decided to make the little girl a free chocolate cupcake instead 
 however this <unk> new problems : how to give it to the little girl without making it seem like charity plus how to <unk> the chances of the mom throwing the cupcake out 
 if i just <unk> had a chocolate cupcake made specially for the little girl it would be suspicious 
 so i made two <unk> : one chocolate one vanilla under the guise that we just keep a bunch of single <unk> made for birthday kids we do n't 
 fast forward to this morning 
 mom and kiddo walk in around <unk> the little girl is absolutely beaming from ear to ear but completely <unk> 
 i bring their cake out and get an <unk> response from mom my decorating skills are top <unk> lady but as soon as the little girl saw her cake she gave a little <unk> and clapped her hands as kids do 
 mom takes the cake and the moment of truth begins 
 & gt me : hold on is this the birthday girl 
 & gt <unk> girl giggles and <unk> & gt me : oh well then let me get your cupcake 
 all the birthday kids get a special cupcake if they come in to pick up their cake 
 & gt <unk> duck into the back and grab the two <unk> & gt me : would you like chocolate or vanilla 
 & gt little girl : chocolate please 
 <unk> <unk> thank you 
 & gt mom : i 'll hold onto that 
 you can have it with your dinner it 's too early for cake 
 let 's go 
 i 've probably set myself up for this lady coming in a year from now expecting another free cupcake for her kid but for now ... <unk> i think most grocery stores have some sort of <unk> system 
 discounts $ 10 off $ 20 off extra points if you spend over $ 100 that kind of thing 
 our store also has its own line of <unk> with the <unk> system being a major drive it 's a credit card and a <unk> card 
 you sign up for one of the credit cards you get $ 50 off your grocery bill 
 seems <unk> yeah 
 well ... no 
 a japanese couple <unk> come to my register with a cart of groceries and they 're waving one of these mastercard coupons in my face 
 their bill came up at $ <unk> they were expecting to only pay $ 4 
 i ask them for their card ... and they pull out their regular <unk> card 
 oh boy 
 me : okay you need the mastercard for this to work for you 
 <unk> at the card on the <unk> do you have the card '' 
 they wave their regular card at me 
 okay ... a language barrier 
 i normally <unk> talking to foreign people like they do n't understand but it 's clear <unk> has no clue what i 'm on about 
 they back and forth speak japanese to each other and keep pointing at the coupon 
 i repeatedly tell them it wo n't work without the mastercard and point at the card 
 they start yelling at me in japanese but i do n't budge 
 me : sorry you do n't have the card so you ca n't get $ 50 off '' 
 <unk> : no '' 
 me : no sorry '' 
 they do n't have $ <unk> 
 they have $ 50 
 they ca n't afford the groceries so i offer to take something off for them 
 they 're not having any of that 
 the husband grabs the cart comes around to my side of the register and shoves it at me full speed and then grabs the <unk> bag of <unk> and throws that at me 
 he then slams the coupon down on the counter and yells full blast in japanese 
 it was a <unk> reaction but i managed to shove him back and scream no 
 get out '' 
 and pointed at the door 
 i always get <unk> when anyone apart from children come around to my side of the register and this is <unk> why 
 kids mostly just want their candy early or they want to scan something which i 'm fine with 
 adults though 
 no 
 my space 
 <unk> : <unk> in <unk> me : get out 
 now 
 out 
 go 
 g and s the managers on duty came running and the customers were eventually told to get out and were banned 
 the managers made it perfectly clear to them what the consequences would be if they ever came back 
 i 'm alright 
 i managed to catch the bag but when i dropped it it split ... <unk> of <unk> everywhere on the fucking floor 
 the worst i 'll have is <unk> from where the cart hit me 
 the managers <unk> with me and realized i screamed because i was <unk> 
 * incident reports done but honestly i do n't think anything else will be done apart from an <unk> ban 
 i 'm all for <unk> but make an attempt to learn basic english if not for your sake for the <unk> sake 
 jesus 
 **tl dr : language barrier ended violently 
 my throat 's still sore from screaming 
 **i 've been working at a small local <unk> shop for about a month now 
 today a woman came in asking if we carried <unk> we do and they were right in front of her 
 i pointed them out and helped her pick out a color she liked 
 when she was done looking around i went to the register to ring her up 
 she paid with a card and tried to swipe it on the <unk> pin pad we keep on the counter 
 i 'm sorry '' i said since you do n't have a chip card i 'm going to have to slide your card myself '' 
 <unk> she handed over her card i swiped it handed it back and asked her to sign our <unk> register screen 
 she was <unk> confused by the screen which most people know to sign with their finger 
 do you have a pen '' 
 she asked while attempting to sign with the corner of her credit card 
 then she stopped mumbled something about credit card fraud and announced she 'd like to pay with cash 
 by this point her card had already gone through but since she refused to sign i could n't complete the transaction 
 <unk> this was a bit difficult and i had to call over my boss 
 he was forced to print a receipt for the transaction then go back issue a refund and print another receipt 
 he became visibly frustrated when the woman insisted we 'd charged her twice i have two receipts 
 you charged me twice '' 
 no ma'am '' said my boss one receipt is for the items you bought 
 the other shows that we refunded you for them '' 
 after about five more minutes of explaining that she had n't been charged twice for her damn things the woman pushed her bag back over the counter folded her arms and said you know what 
 i do n't want this after all 
 this is too much of a <unk> '' then hurried out in a huff 
 **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 **story : ** a couple of weeks ago i <unk> 1300 miles up to <unk> <unk> for the world class fireworks demo 
 for those of you not familiar with <unk> <unk> and god knows none of you should be it 's a little <unk> of a town that’s in the middle of nowhere about <unk> miles from <unk> city <unk> with a <unk> of around 15,000 people 
 i guess the thought was if you 're going to have a massive warehouse that’s full of explosives you should probably put it in the middle of nowhere 
 they succeeded 
 they’re also smart enough to know that if you’re going to host a fireworks demo in the middle of nowhere you should have plenty of food and a fully stocked open bar 
 my so and i spent three days of eating well <unk> <unk> watching fireworks being set off and <unk> the new 2014 product line 
 even better i got to write the entire thing off as a legitimate business trip 
 more proof that i may have <unk> upon the greatest business <unk> ever 
 i’ve included a few photos of the warehouse and product <unk> here friday night we met my sales <unk> had dinner and drinks then attended a demo of their <unk> only product line 
 these are items that must be imported directly from china by the container and are not available <unk> wholesale also known as <unk> good <unk> after two hours of fireworks and a few properly chilled adult beverages my <unk> credit card and i made our escape 
 on saturday my so wanted to do a little shopping so we headed to the mall 
 apparently <unk> is a relative term 
 there was a <unk> a theater maybe a dozen other small stores and a mexican restaurant 
 the shopping <unk> was over pretty quickly and i’ll admit we were definitely making fun of their <unk> until we discovered the $ <unk> <unk> happy hour at the mexican restaurant 
 about an hour later or 5 to 6 <unk> depending on how you keep time the so decides that she is going to get a <unk> at the nail salon in the mall and that i should join her 
 i had a discussion with <unk> <unk> and we decided that it was a wonderful idea 
 based on the looks i received from people walking by the salon i’m relatively sure that i may be the first man in history to receive a <unk> in <unk> <unk> 
 i’ve got news for anyone who’s never had a <unk> it’s fantastic 
 first they sit you down in this oversized <unk> chair that does magical things 
 the remote control looks like something from the bridge of the <unk> and this chair <unk> <unk> and <unk> you in ways i’d have to use the <unk> label to describe 
 i now know why women smile the way they do when they get a <unk> 
 as if the chair wasn’t enough add to that the asian lady <unk> my legs and feet for half an hour 
 i have no idea how much one of those chairs cost but if my so ever leaves me i’m buying myself one to replace her 
 after our afternoon delight we made it back to the warehouse and <unk> to finish setting my credit card on fire 
 i wanted to buy the <unk> <unk> dinosaur to put in my <unk> <unk> that it would keep the <unk> and birds off of my pool screen but my so <unk> shot me down arguing that she was pretty sure my home owners <unk> would have a problem with it 
 i did manage to stock up on plenty of new signs <unk> and other related items 
 by the time the saturday night fireworks demo rolled around there were well over 1000 people there to watch the show 
 i saw some amazing new items that will definitely be on my shelf this year 
 you know it’s a great firework when my comment next to the item on my demo sheet just reads <unk> <unk> 
 sunday we packed it all up drove another 2.5 hours through <unk> to get to <unk> city and happily flew back to sunny orlando 
 another demo done and another credit card <unk> out 
 a side note about <unk> <unk> 
 there is a <unk> coffee there 
 only one location but thankfully it was only a few blocks from our hotel 
 out of all of the <unk> that i’ve visited across the us those guys <unk> it 
 their drive through line moved faster than a <unk> <unk> stop 
 to the <unk> staff i say thank you thank you thank you for keeping me going through a long weekend of late nights early mornings and my friends mr. <unk> and mr. <unk> 
 -- -- if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here so i was at a bookstore today kinda <unk> off in a long line when suddenly i hear from the front of the line you <unk> my son 
 i along with main others look at the front of the line and there 's a woman with large hair with a tone that screams head of the <unk> '' holding up a book 
 <unk> volume 1 of all books 
 for those of you who do n't know <unk> is an action <unk> which is quite <unk> and highly recommended 
 however it 's got sex and violence <unk> and has a mature <unk> rating on the back 
 this lady sold <unk> to my ten year old son '' 
 i was n't the one who sold that to you ma'am '' 
 the young lady says 
 could you describe the person who sold it to you '' 
 she describes the person it hits a march and the lady calls over who we 'll call <unk> 
 <unk> was a tall black woman who from the look on her face was not in the mood for this shit 
 ma'am i remember he came in here with his father maybe two weeks ago looking for a book and grabbed that one 
 i tried to warn him it said on the back m for mature but he was ignoring me '' 
 <unk> says 
 he has hearing problems '' 
 the woman shoots back 
 i demand you refund me this book '' 
 okay i 'll just need to see a receipt '' 
 what '' 
 store policy <unk> a receipt for each refund '' 
 well i do n't have that receipt it 's probably with his dad '' 
 then i ca n't refund this '' 
 why would you even sell something like this '' 
 note : this is <unk> not <unk> 
 it 's one of our most popular comics '' 
 <unk> says 
 we sell it for people who are mature enough to handle it '' 
 the woman storms out of line but not before throwing the book on the ground stomping on it grabbing it again and going to her car 
 <unk> exits laughing her ass off 
 when i finally reach my turn i 've got a volume of <unk> in my stack of things i 'm buying 
 please tell me your parents are okay with this '' 
 the young lady says 
 yep '' 
 it was the truth too 
 i 'm sixteen i 've been buying <unk> <unk> since i was thirteen dad watched the tv series with me when i was <unk> 
 so i leave with my purchases and find the crazy lady is still out there now in a large open space next to a <unk> building next door trying to run over the book with her suv 
 i lost it and laughed all the way home 
 **tl dr it 's your fault my husband ca n't listen i 'm now going to abuse this book 
 that 'll teach it 
 yeah 
 fuck you book 
 <unk> the till at my <unk> gas station and this older lady comes up and i do the usual <unk> chat 
 turns out it was her first time in the doors ever 
 usually just got gas 
 offered her a free fountain drink of her choice any size and she said she was good 
 people just do n't want free stuff anymore i guess 
 anyway she asked for one powerball ticket please 
 i look her dead in the eye 
 **me : ** * '' ma'am 
 sorry to say this but i already bought the 300 million winning ticket this morning 
 do n't worry though i 'll buy you a new car though for being so nice 
 * funny <unk> i 've occasionally used throughout my 4 years in retail 
 sometimes when two people buy lottery at the same time i jokingly say well he was the winning ticket '' 
 <unk> fun 
 corporate believes in being personable 
 not the hello goodbye '' 
 well ... i then proceeded to get my ass chewed out by her 
 <unk> : ** * '' do you stay up at night thinking of rude things to say to people 
 * and it went on and on i blocked most of it out but she <unk> out a few things 
 then gold 
 <unk> : ** *you and me come from different <unk> boy 
 my <unk> was all about <unk> their <unk> and not <unk> off 
 it just shows the <unk> <unk> between us 
 * i was told that this should be something i should post here 
 when i was a teenager back in the <unk> i worked at a department store an old famous one familiar to canadian readers as one of those annoying would you like a store credit card '' 
 people who used to walk the aisles but not the <unk> areas as that was off limits 
 one day during the week i had the job fired for not doing it well i spotted a gentleman walking through the men 's clothing section who was always looking at the ceiling 
 specifically he seemed to be looking at the security cameras 
 he disappeared behind a post where the <unk> were sold and came out with his jacket <unk> all the way up 
 he was still glancing around 
 i immediately walked over to the security guard nearby and said that i saw someone that looked like they were shoplifting 
 as i was explaining what i saw i could see the gentleman heading towards the exit to the rest of the mall 
 i said that 's the guy 
 he 's got the stuff under his jacket '' 
 the security guard did n't see him but got on his <unk> and said something like <unk> is heading towards exit b '' 
 suddenly the shoplifter started walking faster towards the exit as did the security guard 
 they both arrived at about the same time and then stopped 
 the security guard turned to me and said what does he look like 
 is he still in here '' 
 i said that 's the guy right there '' 
 the shoplifter '' then took out his earpiece that was connected to his <unk> and said who 
 what guy '' 
 yup 
 i had been watching an <unk> security guard the entire time 
 when they figured out what happened they both laughed pretty hard 
 they legitimately thanked me for helping '' them and said not to worry about <unk> found this sub and read pages and pages of stories that brought me back 
 my <unk> of duty was with two major big box stores and all my time was spent in lp 
 i never really had to deal with customers for the most part unless they were stealing or injured 
 i always wore plain clothes so customers did n't know who i was but i can still <unk> with most of the stories on here 
 these are the most memorable moments i can think of off the top of my head : - for about six to eight months we had someone that would come in and shit on the sales floor wipe their ass with merchandise and vanish 
 we had no idea who was doing it because it was happening all over the store 
 we eventually referred to the person as the <unk> '' 
 every other week an associate or customers would randomly find a massive pile of shit on the sales floor 
 we would try to review the <unk> footage but were never able to determine who did it 
 the sales floor never had a clue because they never left the register <unk> 
 i felt so bad for our housekeeping staff because they were the ones that had to clean it up 
 i 'm pretty sure one of them quit because they were tired of it 
 one day i 'm walking the sales floor when i <unk> this guy looking very suspicious 
 i figured he was going to <unk> so i slowly made my way over towards him 
 all of a sudden he <unk> down behind a <unk> so i figured he was <unk> merchandise 
 i walked around for a better <unk> point when i saw this dude just straight shitting on the sales floor 
 i immediately screamed out this guy is fucking shitting on the sales floor '' 
 all the customers and associates in the area immediately look over 
 in the course of pulling his pants up in <unk> he managed to shit all over himself as he was pulling them up i will never be able to shake that from my memory 
 he just grabs a hold of his pants which he did n't even have time to button and makes a break for the doors 
 he 's running into everything and knocking fixtures over 
 i following him out the door and yell at him never to come back 
 and that was the end of the <unk> '' <unk> 
 - we were watching this teenage boy alone in the lingerie department feeling up the mannequins 
 he literally <unk> every single one and then darted towards the bathroom 
 the other lp agent that i was working with who was fairly new says i 'm gon na go see what he 's doing in there '' 
 and bolts out of the camera room 
 i knew damn well what was happening in the bathroom 
 i 'm sitting on the camera and i see the kid <unk> out of the bathroom area and book it out the mall entrance 
 the lp agent says he 's going the check the bathroom which was fairly large so i start making my way up there 
 as i am going up the <unk> he yells over the radio he <unk> off in the handicapped bathroom '' 
 i was instantly <unk> because that was my favorite stall to use 
 it was tucked away in the back and it was my little <unk> when i wanted to get away for a while 
 i had to see the <unk> for myself and walked in 
 there was <unk> everywhere on the toilet in the sink 
 it was a <unk> 
 i never used that stall again 
 - our store was <unk> for <unk> and <unk> vehicle would pull up to the door people would pile out of the car run in grab as much merchandise as they could near the entrance run out and get in the car 
 one day another agent is coming into the lp office and says <unk> some crack head near the door that looks like she’s going to do a grab and <unk> sure enough we pull up the cameras and see her grab two arm loads of designer brand <unk> and start making her way towards the doors 
 our office door was right next to the entrance where she was standing so we’re piled up behind the door as i’m watching through the <unk> 
 as soon as she hits the doors we go out after her 
 we instantly grab her in the <unk> and the fight is on 
 it must have looked like the <unk> devil just spinning around in there with <unk> and <unk> flying everywhere 
 of course everyone just stood around and watched as we fought with her 
 all of a sudden i feel my <unk> leg is wet so i look down and see she’s pissed herself and its on me and the other agent 
 with everything i had we got her handcuffed threw her into the office and <unk> ass into the <unk> department 
 we start frantically grabbing whatever clothes we could get our hands on and ran into the bathroom to wash ourselves off and change 
 turns out that the clothes that we wore had to be damaged out since we obviously could wear our <unk> clothes were more expensive than the <unk> so the company ended up losing money on that one 
 lol i just noticed my first three stories all had to do with bodily functions 
 - we had a girl shoplifting inside the fitting room so our female agent was in there waiting to check the stall when she came out to see what was missing 
 the girl exited the store so i followed behind her 
 the female agent was taking forever to get back to me and the girl was <unk> nervous <unk> so i took a <unk> and stopped her before i had confirmed with the agent that she stole 
 as soon as i <unk> myself she took off running through the parking lot and the chase was on 
 i’m yelling on the radio telling the agent that i’m <unk> her on foot to get her ass out of the store 
 i literally chased this girl halfway around the outside of the mall 
 as we’re running i see there’s a car parked in the middle of the street and she’s running right for it 
 she gets up to the passenger side of the vehicle so i block the door instead of grabbing her because i thought she was going to get in the car 
 she bolts away from the car and i tackle her in a last ditch effort 
 i just get her handcuffed when i look over at the car and see the driver has gotten out of the car and is walking towards me holding a gun 
 i jump right off of her start to back away and say “you can have the <unk> the guy doesn’t say a word gets back in his car and leaves 
 at this time my <unk> finally gets there 
 i pass the shoplifter off to them and we start walking back to the store 
 as we get to the store i tell the rest of the staff that i am going to stay outside for a minute to catch my breath 
 next thing i know i opened my eyes inside an ambulance 
 apparently i passed out on the sidewalk and some customers called 911. i get to the hospital and all the cops that i know are coming in to check on me 
 all of a sudden one of the cops says “i think your girl is faking it.” i was like huh 
 he goes <unk> the <unk> and points across the emergency room 
 come to find out when they took the shoplifter inside the store she passed out as well and they had to call another ambulance for her 
 i look over and there she is laying in a bed right across from me 
 we started yelling obscenities back and forth to each other and they had to move her to the opposite side of the er 
 <unk> some other random stuff that i’ll just get right to the point of because i’m getting pretty tired of typing : - i had two customers that died on the sales floor while waiting on their <unk> who were shopping inside the store 
 what a miserable way to go 
 heart attacks - i once fought a <unk> that had a <unk> blade in <unk> mouth and tried to spray us with bear <unk> 
 - i can’t count the number of times i saw parents take their <unk> in a <unk> on <unk> and the <unk> have gone tumbling down the <unk> 
 seriously fuck you if you take your kid in a <unk> on the <unk> 
 - don’t ever pick up a pile of clothes off the fitting room floor because chances are someone has pissed on them 
 - people fuck in fitting rooms a lot 
 - the women’s bathrooms are <unk> more disgusting than the <unk> bathroom 
 i can’t tell you the number of times i saw <unk> sprayed all over the toilet walls and floors in the women’s bathroom when we’re checking for customers at the end of the night 
 not to mention all the bloody toilet seats bloody and/or shitty <unk> left behind and <unk> just thrown about 
 fucking gross 
 - i’ll never forget there was a report of a fire on the second floor so we all booked it towards the area where the fire was 
 i was running past a certain <unk> line counter and there was this girl that i was absolutely in love with when all of a sudden i tripped fell and landed right at her feet hard as hell 
 i had my radio in my hand and used that to break my fall 
 the radio exploded when it hit the floor and shattered into a million pieces 
 i never walked by her again 
 i never let a sales associate get <unk> abused by a customer and was quick to kick customers out of the store if they started to get loud with an employee 
 i’m sure there’s tons more stories that i can’t think of right now 
 i’ve been out since <unk> and have yet to step foot back inside a mall for any reason 
 it’s a nice feeling to be able to look forward to holidays now instead of <unk> them 
 keep fighting the good fight and don’t take shit from anyone literally 
 tl : dr fuck <unk> : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the 4th of july and new years eve 
 **story : ** as usual it was a madhouse at my store on new year’s eve 
 the morning started kind of slow but by noon we were packed and having trouble just keeping the shelves stocked 
 one of my employees flagged me down and pointed out some guys that wanted to speak with the manger 
 i made my way over to them and happily asked how i could be of assistance 
 the <unk> was obviously looking for a deal 
 i’ve got no problem with that 
 in fact the wheeling and dealing can be one of the things i enjoy most 
 i started showing them around and <unk> their questions 
 i even <unk> the wheel by handing each of them a discount card for a buy 1 get 2 free special on a single item up to $ 50 
 as we talked i found out that they had already purchased fireworks from another store the day before but they had blown them off and were looking to <unk> 
 it didn’t take long before they were complaining about my prices claiming that they could get the same stuff from another store much cheaper 
 they were pointing out specific products and telling me how much less <unk> paid for the exact same item yesterday and how i was just ripping people off 
 one of the guys kept pointing to random items and saying <unk> 
 i understand wanting to get a deal but being an ass or being nasty is pretty much just going to piss me off 
 now i make sure that i carry the absolute best fireworks and i try hard to price them lower than what my competitors charge for their mediocre <unk> 
 we even have a price guarantee with signs posted that we’ll beat any <unk> retail price on the same item by 5 % 
 i’m very confident in my prices and these three guys were getting to me 
 even worse i was wondering if maybe a new place had popped up and was <unk> me to gain business 
 as i’m starting to worry about the potential for a price war with a new competitor one of the guys points out a mortar pack and says <unk> got this exact same pack of <unk> from a place in <unk> for $ <unk> and yours costs $ <unk> it was like christmas morning and my birthday all rolled into one 
 you see i’m actually good friends with the owner of the company they were talking about 
 i know what he sells i know what his prices are and i now knew that the three guys were trying to scam me 
 **me : ** well that makes it easy 
 there’s only one fireworks company in <unk> other company name 
 if they’re selling it for that i’ll beat their price 
 give me one minute pulling out my phone and <unk> the <unk> number 
 **me : ** standing in front of the three guys hey fireworks buddy it’s <unk> from my company 
 i’ve got three guys here that say they bought a 12 pack of boom boom <unk> from your store yesterday for $ <unk> 
 i just wanted to call and verify that you selling them for that price 
 listening to the phone **me : ** <unk> you don’t carry the 12 pack of boom boom <unk> you sell the 6 pack for $ <unk> 
 ok that makes a lot more sense 
 they also said that they picked up an <unk> <unk> finale from you yesterday for $ 100 
 listening to the phone **me : ** <unk> you don’t actually carry the <unk> <unk> finale 
 i didn’t think you did but i wanted to make sure 
 listening to the phone **me : ** no just three assholes trying to scam me 
 thanks for the info 
 yell at you later 
 hanging up the phone and looking at the three guys **me : ** it appears you were mistaken 
 he sells the 6 pack of <unk> for $ <unk> not the 12 pack 
 feel free to grab me if you have any more questions 
 i turned around and walked away from the three of them 
 surprisingly they actually ended up staying and buying fireworks 
 -- -- -- - if you’re interested i’ve posted a few other stories here **background : ** i own and operate my own retail store 
 it 's actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent you 've seen before 
 it 's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven 
 **story : ** i got a phone call from a guy asking about our selection of fireworks 
 he said he and his friends were putting on a little show and they were looking to pick up some good stuff 
 we have a lot of customers that do the same thing 
 <unk> get together with friends or have a block party everyone will throw in some cash and <unk> put on their own show 
 i explained how we had everything they needed as well as videos of all the fireworks 
 the guy says thanks and hangs up 
 a few hours later three guys in their early <unk> walked in and asked for me 
 they looked pretty ragged with scraggly <unk> and camo pants but then again i’m selling explosives out of a tent in a parking lot 
 i started showing them videos of our stuff and explained different effects and ways to put on a good show 
 one of the guys asked for paper and a pen and would <unk> <unk> on the <unk> we gave him 
 this went on for at least an hour 
 i do n't think the three of them combined said more than 50 words the entire time 
 afterward one of them told me thank you and they walked out the door 
 it was pretty slow that day so guess it wasn’t really a waste of my time but i was still a little <unk> out by their behavior 
 <unk> who walks back through the door an hour <unk> i was actually helping someone else at the time so my dad went to take care of them 
 it was like <unk> <unk> 
 they spent another hour walking around watching videos then out the door again 
 <unk> who walks back through the door an hour <unk> i didn’t actually see them come in but one of them walked past me carrying something in his hands while i was helping another customer 
 i’m trying to pay attention to the person i’m helping but i can see these guys all walking around with their arms full and i’m wondering what the hell is going on 
 i excuse myself and head to the front of the store 
 when i get to the front i’m greeted by a replica of the great wall of china made entirely of fireworks 
 these guys are grabbing 2 sometimes 3 or 4 of each item and <unk> one of the great <unk> of the world at the front of my store 
 i’m trying to help them but i swear to god these guys still aren’t saying 10 words to me 
 when the dust <unk> my store looks like it’s been <unk> 
 i’m pretty sure they grabbed at least one or two of damn near everything i sell 
 i honestly had two different cashiers ring them up on two registers at the same time just to get through the mountain of stuff 
 we swapped out multiple pieces with full cases where we could 
 the entire time the <unk> is just standing around watching us ring it and box it 
 no small talk no chatter 
 when i had to ask them a question i’d get a one or two word reply 
 when we finished i let them know that i appreciated their business and since they had purchased so much i was going to give them a <unk> discount 
 to put it in perspective the discount was more than $ 1000 
 no smile no high five no victory <unk> 
 just looked and me with a blank stare said thanks and paid in cash 
 the story should end <unk> it doesn’t 
 one of the three leaves and pulls around in an old <unk> van 
 it has bucket seats for both the driver and the passenger and a bench seat for the third guy 
 immediately i realize that there’s no way in hell they’re going to fit all of the fireworks in the van 
 i went to offer assistance but they of course said no thanks 
 at this point i think my entire staff was standing outside of the tent watching the 3 of them play fireworks <unk> 
 after about 15 minutes i think they caught on that it wasn’t all going to fit 
 the <unk> the bench seat 
 they asked if they could leave it and pick it up later and i happily said yes 
 they finally get it loaded and i mean this thing is stuffed to the <unk> 
 they had stacked the fireworks to the ceiling in back but had actually left a little space between the fireworks and the roof just behind the two bucket seats 
 when they go to leave all three of them climb in the van 
 the driver in the driver’s seat the passenger in the <unk> seat and the third person <unk> on top of the cases of <unk> 
 as they drove away my dad <unk> it up perfectly 
 **dad : ** if they get into a car accident on the way home the police aren’t going to find anything left of them bigger than a quarter 
 i 've posted a few other stories here if you 're <unk> wish i would have called in work today 
 near the end of my shift my coworker came in and was asking me about signs for the garden shop where i was working today and noticed something in the parking lot asking if it was a person on the ground 
 i <unk> outside to find a woman who had collapsed and had a heart attack 
 laying <unk> and not <unk> 
 i was the first one out there and immediately ran inside and got an ambulance on the way 
 i <unk> back outside and blocked off the area while someone gave her cpr 
 started talking to the woman 's granddaughter who was six years old off to the side while everyone did what they could to save the woman who was <unk> not <unk> and according to them had no heartbeat 
 i just kept her granddaughter occupied the entire talking to her about school and her <unk> and what not 
 the look on the woman 's face was bad enough pale white with her eyes wide open but the granddaughter got me the most when she asked if <unk> was gon na be okay '' 
 eventually the granddaughter 's mother arrived and picked her up and thanked me then drove off to follow the ambulance once it left 
 they tried cpr again with an <unk> mask and also tried using a <unk> but to no avail 
 the last 30 minutes of my shift were hard 
 i could n't stop thinking about how the little six year old girl probably just witnessed her grandma whom of which was n't very old die 
 i got home and told my parents about it but they seemed kind <unk> <unk> about it 
 like it was n't a big deal 
 i 'm still not sure if i did the right thing or if there was more that i could do to help her 
 i 'm currently stressed out and confused right now it being <unk> week for my high school 
 i really do n't know what to feel right now 
 **edit** : i would like to thank everyone for all of their <unk> words on this matter 
 i ended up going to bed extremely early and not being <unk> for when many of the messages and comments were sent but i assure you i 've read them all now at 3am 
 your words mean more than you think 
 as for whoever <unk> me gold as i 'm not able to see <unk> damn mobile reddit apps thank you as well 
 even through thousands of karma this is my first gold ever 
 <unk> noises go <unk> 
 ill be sure to use it all in preparation for a better <unk> for the whole thing 
 which i may not have to try <unk> hard already being <unk> by hundreds of you caring people 
 thank you all so much <unk> where i work we have coupons out every week for x amount of a regular priced item or off your entire regular priced purchase 
 i had this <unk> of folks come in <unk> of two ladies and a man 
 i 'm helping one woman while my coworker is helping the couple 
 the woman i 'm helping is cheap lady the other is <unk> lady and the man is smart man 
 so cl is trying to purchase a book and with every coupon it has the coupon fine print and <unk> which include <unk> items like books magazines and dvds 
 the book is $ 13 and i immediately tell her the coupon wo n't apply to the book so we have the following back and forth 
 me : the coupon will come off all your <unk> but not the book due to it being <unk> 
 cl : what 
 where does it say that 
 i did n't see that on the sale sign either 
 i went to the display after we closed and sure enough it says it <unk> the books 
 <unk> to point it out on the coupon 
 * <unk> : what 
 that 's dumb 
 who has time to sit there and read the fine print 
 that 's ridiculous 
 me : well just because people do n't want to read it does n't mean it is n't there or is n't valid 
 at this point i was <unk> and was having some home issues that i took with me to work which i know is n't fair but <unk> 
 sm : well that makes sense 
 *takes out his card and pays for his transaction while <unk> gives me the stink <unk> cl : well then i do n't want the book if i ca n't use a coupon on it 
 there 's going to be a very sad little girl and it 's all your fault 
 you 're ruining her birthday 
 so i just shrug take the book off and tell her the total 
 she <unk> the entire time while taking out the cash and completely ignores my <unk> hand placing it on the counter 
 i smile get her change and place it on the counter 
 she had <unk> nails so she struggled to pick up the change 
 i put her receipt in the bag and wish them a good night 
 honestly just because you do n't read a <unk> agreement or the fine print does n't make it <unk> 
 during the summer months at my ice cream shop i do n't normally get to see my <unk> regulars 
 today i got to see one of my favorites a mom and her daughter come and get treats 
 mom is very friendly and <unk> and daughter is a <unk> pretty young lady 
 i genuinely enjoy having them in store 
 it had been at least a month since i 'd seen them and daughter had her hair cut in a short bob 
 & gt me : hey you cut your hair 
 i like it 
 & gt & gt daughter : thanks i do too 
 & gt & gt mom : she donated her hair to cancer patients 
 <unk> smile* while we were discussing the state of daughter 's new hair i was getting ready to ring up the next lady gl 
 she had overheard the conversation about daughter 's hair and was talking to them for a bit about it too 
 i completed the transaction with gl and handed her the change 
 however she gave me a $ 5 back 
 & gt gl : use this to pay for that little girl 's yogurt 
 & gt & gt me : thank you ma'am that 's a generous thing you 're doing 
 & gt & gt gl : she 's the generous one 
 <unk> gl leaves and mom and daughter take a bit to get to the till 
 their total came to $ <unk> so i rung up the $ 5 and told mom your total is 17 cents '' 
 she cheerfully opened her wallet then confusion came over her and she said that 's it 
 really '' 
 i said a generous lady paid for your yogurt today because she was moved by your daughter 's choice to donate her hair to cancer patients '' 
 mom 's jaw dropped 
 she looked at me looked at her daughter and then back at me 
 she said oh my gosh 
 i 've got <unk> 
 god is <unk> '' 
 she handed me her payment and while i <unk> the coins into the appropriate slots she explained to her daughter who did n't understand what happened why they did n't have to pay for yogurt today 
 i 've never seen such a proud or grateful customer 
 i 've witnessed a couple customers paying for other people 's yogurt but this mom and daughter <unk> were the most thankful i 've seen 
 of all the customers i 've had come in i 'm glad that she and her daughter could benefit from the kindness of a stranger 
 edit : <unk> was walking up to my place of employment a few minutes before we opened at 7 am 
 thus the parking lot is usually pretty empty 
 i noticed a car coming my direction as i was walking into the <unk> but they had a stop sign and seemed far enough away so i proceeded to cross to get into the building 
 i noticed that the car was n't slowing down 
 they ran the stop sign but i was able to get out of the way before they hit me 
 i 'm on the sidewalk now and the woman in the car stopped and rolled down her window 
 she yells out hey i was just trying to get your attention 
 where is the nearest overpriced coffee chain 
 i was told there is one in your plaza '' 
 there are two of those not even a minute 's drive down the street and another three on campus 
 there is no sign for that shop in my little plaza 's <unk> 
 but really i should n't expect that woman who thinks attempted <unk> <unk> is an appropriate <unk> to <unk> a <unk> or a map 
 i work in photo <unk> printing service 
 it means we print <unk> photo books <unk> posters cards etc 
 a man came in today and wanted to print thank you '' <unk> 
 so first he needed to select if he wants them printed on photo paper or traditional <unk> paper 
 i placed different papers in front of him so he could <unk> them 
 that was obviously too hard for him 
 i just want these printed '' 
 <unk> an usb <unk> yes sir i understand but you need to select the material first '' 
 how is it so fucking hard to just print these 
 no wonder all photo stores are going out of business 
 <unk> horrible service '' 
 for over ten minutes i tried to fish information out of him 
 like this 
 no 
 maybe a card like this 
 i thought you were a professional you should know how can this be so hard '' 
 i showed him every single option we had and nothing pleased him 
 <unk> <unk> not like that just print it 
 then his ranting became louder and louder <unk> other customers so finally i gave up and told him either to leave or make up his mind and tell me what is it you want because honestly i do n't know 
 he stared at me and said you 're a really shitty <unk> '' 
 and left 
 i 'm so sorry that my employer does n't provide us with <unk> <unk> balls 
 they would come in <unk> work as a customer service associate in a national <unk> 
 i 'm also in a walking boot until i have an <unk> to determine the cause of my foot pain 
 this is relevant 
 a teenage girl came in to purchase some items 
 she also asked for cigarettes so i asked for her id 
 girl : '' i do n't have it with me but they 're not for me they 're for my mom '' 
 two problems here : one she does n't have an id at all 
 two she 's purchasing for someone else and by law now that i know that i ca n't sell them to her regardless of who they 're for 
 i explain this 
 girl : '' so basically i ca n't buy any today '' 
 me : '' no sorry '' 
 a few minutes later mom comes in visibly irritated 
 mom : '' i sent my daughter in to buy these for me and she said you would n't sell them to her '' 
 me : '' she did n't have an id 
 i could n't sell them to her '' 
 mom : '' i could have <unk> she had it 
 you should have just sold them to her since they were for me 
 i have foot problems and it <unk> to walk '' 
 step into my <unk> 
 me : '' ma'am it 's illegal to sell to anyone if you ask for an id and they ca n't present one 
 i can lose my job 
 i also do understand your foot pain as i 'm currently in a boot myself 
 it 's no fun '' 
 mom continued to look grumpy and did n't speak for the rest of the transaction 
 tl dr : mom walked <unk> normally for someone in foot pain and no i will not sell cigarettes to your teenage daughter 
 edit : damn this blew up 
 one i 'm honored to have the quote of the day on tfr 
 love you <unk> 
 also a thing about the law in my state : one of the biggest things is that if a person of age is making an alcohol or tobacco purchase but you <unk> it is n't for them or in this case they outright state it is n't you can not sell the item to them 
 consequences <unk> of <unk> for the individual the store job loss and a possible <unk> *even if you are not aware that the person of age is buying for an underage <unk> 
 i explain more in this <unk> a week or so ago my fellow co-worker dropped this story on me 
 i 'm sharing this on his behalf 
 he works the same place i work 
 a gas station kiosk 
 we both work separate because it 's a one person kiosk 
 this is what happened 
 for context this customer was really ... dumb 
 employee : yes sir customer : i would like $ x.xx in gas and i also want a fuel <unk> <unk> for my vehicle 
 employee : sorry sir we do n't sell any <unk> <unk> other than what is sold through the pump 
 we do n't sell any fuel system <unk> because when you pay for gas the pump prompts you if you want to buy any 
 it 's a contract that we have to sell that stuff so we do n't sell other competitors <unk> in our oil cart 
 many customers understand this and many more do not and hate it because they want a certain brand or whatever customer : well why not 
 i want x brand <unk> 
 employee : we only sell x brand at the pump he pays for his gas and turns around looks at our oil cart 
 proceeds to grab a bottle of our power <unk> fluid and walks to the pump which his happens to be right in front of the kiosk 
 my co-worker did n't say anything because 1. he sees him and <unk> customer just come back and pay after they use item 
 we hate it but they come back and pay for it anyway rarely do we have to make customer pay for acting stupid thinking we wo n't say anything 2. maybe he needed power <unk> fluid 
 who knows so man goes to his pump and proceeds to pour that power <unk> fluid into his gas tank ... at this time my co-worker was busy with a technician who was he to repair a broken pump 
 when he finally saw the customer putting the power <unk> fluid in his tank it was to late 
 he had already started 
 both my co-worker and tech are dumbfounded 
 employee : wow what a dumbass tech : you gon na tell him 
 employee : no 
 i told him we did n't sell fuel <unk> <unk> other than at the pump and he wants to be a idiot let him 
 tech : eh not my problem 
 the man finishes pumping gas and comes back to pay for his power <unk> fluid 
 customer : so much for you do n't sell fuel <unk> <unk> 
 employee : excuse me ... 
 we do n't i had told you we only see what is at the pump 
 you just poured power <unk> fluid into your gas tank 
 customer : finally looks at bottle well i 'm not paying for it employee : the hell your not you used it 
 not in the correct way but you used it 
 it 's gon na be $ x.xx customer left without saying another word 
 but just amazing 
 i have yet to see him and so has my co-worker 
 but this was beyond me 
 customer thought the joke was on my co-worker for lying to him but it was on him for not reading the bottle he took and <unk> had a rough day today 
 our cash register broke 
 after i fixed it a mistype charged a customer $ <unk> instead of $ <unk> only in the cash register and not the credit card machine 
 so i spent a good thirty minutes <unk> that transaction in the register 
 <unk> level : <unk> because after a certain amount of money around $ <unk> you 're unable to cancel a transaction and have to charge it through and void it etc etc 
 this is while also helping other customers in the store 
 it was busy i wanted to lock myself in the bathroom and take a <unk> 
 the store i work at is literally filled to the brim with merch 
 we 're packed 
 85 % of our clientele are repeat customers i know their names and faces they know my name and treat me like a human being 
 it 's extremely pleasant but extremely hectic and busy 
 anyway this woman who is a <unk> had come in and ordered probably $ 300 of <unk> items for <unk> presents and on her way out her purse knocked into a <unk> <unk> it fell over and shattered 
 our policy is n't necessarily you break it you buy it '' since we 're a mom and pop store so it really <unk> on the customer 
 charging a customer for a broken item is completely <unk> on whoever 's in charge that day so usually up to me since i 've been at the store the longest of the current employees and the owner of the store took today off 
 so this woman knocks a <unk> over it <unk> on the floor 
 huge crash hundreds of little <unk> pieces 
 oh my god i 'm so sorry '' 
 she starts to pick up the broken pieces i grab a <unk> and come over to sweep it up 
 my bag must have bumped into it and knocked it over 
 i feel terrible i 'm so sorry '' 
 she says 
 ma'am with the amount of items we have in the store it 's bound to happen every so often 
 do n't worry about it '' 
 i hope it was n't expensive how much do i owe y'all '' 
 nothing ma'am 
 it was obviously an accident and it 's only around $ 30 so it 's not that big of a deal '' 
 really let me pay for it '' 
 ma'am the fact that you 're helping me clean it up is so <unk> that there is no way i 'm going to charge you for this '' 
 are you sure '' 
 yes 
 really thank you for helping me 
 have a great day '' 
 i 'm finished sweeping it up and she 's out the door 
 i grab a box to put the broken pieces in and throw the whole thing in a dumpster and just as i get back inside the phone rings 
 i answer it 's the same woman 
 i just really wanted to just say once again how sorry i am that i broke that <unk> 
 i know it was an accident and you said that it was fine but i really am more than happy to pay for it '' 
 ma'am i 'm going to be completely blunt with you 
 when things get broken in the store i 'm the one that decides on the you break it you buy it '' policy 
 not only was this a complete accident but you did n't try to hide that you had broken something 
 you even helped me clean it up 
 you have to understand that never happens 
 after the start of my day today how you responded to breaking something was so <unk> <unk> and kind there 's no way i 'm going to charge you 
 you 're the type of customer i 'm happy to do things like this for '' 
 she thanked me again told me she appreciated it 
 i had a smile on my face for the rest of the day 
 it 's the little <unk> came into work today clocked in and noticed something strange on my time slip 
 instead of <unk> cook '' on the bottom i have the label ft sl '' 
 i walk to the back office where my manager is doing some paperwork and ask him what it meant 
 oh yeah 
 that stands for <unk> end shift lead '' 
 uh 
 what '' 
 yeah ... 
 wait '' 
 ... nobody told me '' 
 oh 
 well <unk> you 're the new supervisor '' 
 so ... i got a promotion and they neglected to tell me.i was a cashier for the <unk> largest burger joint in <unk> and i regularly volunteered for drive through duty quite simply because it was interesting and you never know what you 'll see 
 one night right before close two bros '' come to my window 
 besides the fact that they kept changing their minds about what they wanted and generally just being <unk> both of them were drunk off their asses 
 they finally paid and pulled forward and i was still annoyed ... for two seconds when one of my regulars pulled up in his squad car on duty 
 the <unk> must have been <unk> or the <unk> smiling on me but i was like hey <unk> '' i was getting ready to call you guys but that guy in front of you is wasted and you can smell it it 's bad '' 
 he 's like o <unk> did n't order waited till they got their food then flipped on the lights 
 as i was closing up i kept looking out as it <unk> from <unk> tests to back up to handcuffs to tow truck <unk> 
 at least they got those <unk> 
 edit : formatting and yes i took him and his back up a meal as i left probably wasnt warm by then but good enough for the midnight <unk> showed great <unk> by not <unk> some customers to death 
 the family was in my shop for about 45 minutes before i noticed the dog 
 the mom asked to use the bathroom and handed off what i thought was the lady 's brown clutch purse 
 it was a tiny puppy 
 apparently they bought the puppy at the flea market down the street before entering my store 
 it was seven weeks old and severely <unk> 
 not surprising since it was a <unk> hot day 
 somehow they thought that it was a great time to go book shopping 
 as soon as i saw how <unk> the dog was i got a <unk> of water 
 the puppy <unk> <unk> it up and seemed to <unk> up a bit 
 the family was in no hurry to leave 
 i told them that the dog looked like he needed some food 
 the woman snapped that she knew all about taking care of dogs 
 she also told me the dog was a pure <unk> <unk> '' 
 so as well as needing dog care books she needed a <unk> 
 she mentioned that she did n't want to give the dog any water since she was worried that it would pee in the car 
 a seven week old puppy 
 it should n't even be away from its mother at seven weeks 
 then they mentioned that they live about an hour 's drive away 
 actually i do n't know if i showed great <unk> in not <unk> them or <unk> my responsibility as a human being 
 a big part of me wanted to take that dog away from them 
 i really hope the puppy is <unk> there tfr 
 i 've posted before like that time a lady tried to <unk> me but i do n't strictly work retail - however there 's a retail <unk> to my job in fact we broke our all time sales record tonight closing at <unk> $ <unk> which is almost triple what we pull in on a normal night 
 so 
 bit of back story 
 we run a shop which is open from 9am to <unk> 
 however we have a <unk> program that goes from 6pm to 10pm then we bring in the <unk> and go home 
 we 're open every day of the year 
 every night a car rolls in at <unk> 
 we call them the <unk> nine fifty <unk> '' 
 so the <unk> get out 
 asks how he can use the <unk> 
 i tell him that you do n't we do - but have a look through because that 's why they 're around '' 
 then one of them tries to go inside our doors were open to bring some stuff inside from outside 
 i tell him we 're closed 
 he insists that because google told him we 're open until 10 we should let him in 
 & gt **me : ** no sir i ca n't do that 
 we 're closed 
 & gt <unk> : ** but i just want a map 
 & gt **me : ** yes 
 we have maps for sale but we 're closed 
 & gt <unk> : ** oh they 're for sale 
 & gt **me : ** yes they are and we 're closed 
 you may look through a <unk> if you 'd like they 're out here for a few more minutes 
 & gt <unk> : ** so i ca n't just come inside 
 there are only a few times when i 've wanted to tell someone to fuck off while i 'm at work 
 so i did it in a nice way 
 kind of 
 & gt **me : ** no sir 
 absolutely not 
 it is strictly <unk> and not least of all we are closed 
 the money is away and counted 
 we 've closed up everything and taken inside the carts with the water and such 
 there 's nothing left and your girlfriend is running to the car because it 's freezing cold out 
 we are not open until 10. you are mistaken 
 and no you ca n't continue to drive to the <unk> 
 it 's probably best you just head home as there 's nothing left to do here 
 and so they did 
 they left 
 and all was good <unk> my two <unk> jobs one is as the manager of a pet supply retail store 
 i was on a register when a woman came through my line to check out 
 me : alright your total is $ <unk> '' 
 she took out her purse and calmly handed me two twenty dollar bills 
 i waited but she made no motion to find any change 
 i waited but she just stared at me 
 me : it 's $ 40 and two cents ma'am '' 
 i repeated myself in case she had n't heard me 
 she eyed me in this weirdly angry and suspicious way and then smugly declared i do n't carry <unk> '' 
 like it was <unk> her 
 and she just let it linger awkwardly between us while she stared at me <unk> 
 me : well the total is $ 40 and two pennies '' 
 and i quietly stared back letting her awkward silence linger 
 after a beat or two her face crumpled up and she did this weird <unk> <unk> of disgust at me as if i had just flipped her off while wearing dead <unk> for slippers 
 i 'm not kidding 
 it was the most <unk> <unk> i 've ever seen outside of bad <unk> 
 her : so what are you going to about that '' 
 me : you 've already had $ <unk> in savings with your membership rewards card 
 there are n't any more discounts and you do n't have any coupons 
 i can put some items back for you if you do n't have enough for the rest '' 
 note : i always keep my voice low when people appear to be having problems paying 
 no need to <unk> a customer who 's fallen onto hard times 
 i 've been there before 
 cue another round of <unk> <unk> and nasty looks 
 seriously what the hell is up with these <unk> facial <unk> she 's doing 
 her : i ca n't believe you 're <unk> me up over two pennies 
 i 'll take my business elsewhere 
 give me my twenties back '' 
 i <unk> my display around to show her the price while handing her back her cash 
 i 'm sorry but that 's the total amount due if you want all these items today 
 do you have a credit card maybe 
 it 's really no problem to put just one of these dog treats back if you do n't have change '' 
 she had seven of the same <unk> <unk> bags in her bag 
 her dog did n't need one of them much less seven packs of seven 
 her : i do n't carry change 
 what 's so hard to understand about that '' 
 me : then this transaction is over '' 
 i grabbed her bagged items and put them under the counter out of her reach in case she decided to bolt with them 
 more <unk> 
 no actually i got a <unk> out of that one 
 and the look of utter disgust i got from her 
 you would have thought i had just <unk> into my hand and then <unk> <unk> 
 at this point i began to <unk> i was dealing with a mentally <unk> person rather than an entitled <unk> 
 one of my co-workers an army vet overheard the commotion and quietly came up behind my counter ready to assist if it became physical 
 being a former military police officer in the <unk> myself i felt confident that i could handle an <unk> white lady in her <unk> but it was nice to see cover taking up position 
 her : oh you want a dollar from me is that it '' 
 the lady was waving her fingers at the cash register screen which was still pointed in her direction 
 me : no just two pennies 
 but if you have a dollar more i can give you change back '' 
 she <unk> through her purse some and produced a dollar bill which she threw angrily at me but it sort of <unk> comically down to the <unk> belt between us 
 then she wadded up her twenties and slammed them on the belt too 
 i collected her free market <unk> and began making change when the lady turned to my co-worker behind her and started talking shit about me in <unk> <unk> 
 from what little i could hear it was the usual threats : how it 's the worst service ever how she 'll never come back here etc 
 and by the way why is it people think i 'll never come back here again '' is a threat to retail employees 
 if you 're giving us problems *we do n't want you to come back 
 * go sell crazy somewhere else 
 i handed her change back to her and she made this <unk> act of <unk> in and reading the name badges of both myself and my co-worker <unk> had done nothing at all throughout the entire <unk> as if she was going to complain about the two of us 
 finally she took her items and left 
 once she was out of <unk> my co-worker told me in the middle of all that she said she was deaf and could n't read your lips '' 
 thinking back i know this was a lie because she was answering my greetings without even looking at me at the start of the transaction while she was loading up her items on the <unk> belt 
 at no point in the interaction did she act like she could n't understand what i was saying 
 me : no 
 no 
 no 
 that was not the issue here 
 she understood everything i was saying she just did n't <unk> what i was saying 
 you can be deaf and a jerk at the same time '' 
 **the moral of this story is that you get more <unk> with honey than you do with vinegar 
 ** -- - edit : most of you in the comments are right 
 if the lady was nice or had asked if it was okay that she was two <unk> pennies short i would have bent over backwards to help her out 
 i probably could have found a $ 5 off coupon somewhere in our office that would have saved her even more than two cents 
 but she was rude and <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of her own actions 
 edit 2 : i 've been repeatedly called a jerk for this story which is fine 
 i am one in real life but in this story i went through our lines for customer <unk> and <unk> nearly verbatim 
 customer does n't give you the full amount due 
 ask for the full amount again 
 customer does n't have enough money 
 offer to put an item back ask for alternative method of payment hold items for later pickup or void transaction 
 cashiers are under <unk> circumstances allowed to <unk> to <unk> our own sales prices <unk> the customer has to ask specifically for a <unk> 
 and even if they do ask price <unk> are done at the manager 's discretion as circumstances warrant which they probably are n't going to do if the only reason you want it is because you 're an unpleasant person 
 i find it a little <unk> that i was harassed and threatened by a lying customer and after following my own store 's <unk> policy people have been calling *me* the jerk 
 if i was wearing a short skirt and sporting some <unk> would i have deserved '' it too about a year ago i started working at a large retail chain 
 the particular location i was employed at was going through a lot of changes in management procedures and the like 
 basically the store was in a <unk> <unk> and could n't keep employees for more than a month or two at best 
 beyond the usual age verification for certain items there was no standard procedure followed by anybody with regards to people purchasing tobacco lottery or basically any <unk> items that had to be <unk> behind the counter 
 we would take the items scan them and put them on the counter while the customer paid for them 
 did n't have any issues 
 one day we had a loss prevention guy come in and observe our security procedures 
 one of his <unk> '' was that when making these kind of sales we do not place them in reach of the customers until they are paid for in full 
 okay seems reasonable 
 nobody should have a problem with this unless they actually plan to steal shit right 
 not so 
 from the time we <unk> the measure there was one guy a regular who came in to buy cigarettes every day and he had a huge problem with this 
 where are my cigarettes '' 
 they 're here behind the counter sir '' 
 well why are n't they in my hand yet '' 
 because you have not yet paid for them sir 
 we have new security <unk> in place to prevent potential <unk> '' 
 so you think i 'm going to steal them '' 
 no sir '' 
 well then put them in my fucking hand '' 
 no sir that would breach proper procedure 
 i do n't think you 're going to steal them but this is the rule and it will be followed '' 
 i do n't care what the rule is you have no right to treat me like a criminal 
 now put the smokes in my hand or i 'm going to talk to your manager '' 
 okay sir i 'll call him from the back '' 
 so i rang the button that <unk> the backroom and an assistant manager came out and asked what was going on 
 they talked for a while and decided that i would place the cigarettes in his hand <unk> procedure and making me look like an asshole 
 so i did 
 and the guy smirks at me and says there was that so hard 
 at least your managers are competent 
 maybe you should get a job cleaning toilets or something seems more your speed '' 
 right in front of my manager 
 at this point i looked at my manager and said hey <unk> did you hear what he just said to me 
 that was an abusive comment and i 'm not going to take it '' 
 i told him to hand back the cigarettes and get out of the store but he refused 
 you put them in my hand they 're mine now 
 take my money or do n't they 're mine '' 
 so i looked at my manager and said this is what happens when you do n't follow procedure and make me look like an idiot <unk> 
 this is your problem now i quit '' 
 and i walked out 
 abusive customers suck and managers who <unk> them are worse 
 edit : guys do n't <unk> people just for <unk> suggesting that i could have done things differently 
 if somebody 's being an asshole and <unk> insults fine 
 but there 's a comment from <unk> <unk> down there that i do n't feel warrants the negative attention it 's receiving 
 he seems like an ok guy : hey everyone - <unk> long time lurker <unk> mobile phone and formatting and english language etc 
 so 
 the background story goes like this : i have a <unk> store with my partner 
 we are located in a small mall with a mix of very very wealthy customers and not so wealthy customers 
 i 've only had one real incident before in the ca 
 <unk> on and off years in retail but in the past year i 've had an office job which has made me a bit slow in terms of knowing if the customer is actually for real with their <unk> 
 the <unk> happened today with a local customer who is not a customer since he did n't come to buy anything * he just came to trash talk me * 
 just a quick note : the culture in this country is such that <unk> of the local men <unk> very <unk> towards young women 
 especially us young <unk> girls * i am mixed <unk> half of that country and half white * anyways the man will be called dh for <unk> and my partner will be p. ... <unk> comes to the shop to look at our <unk> gold chains 
 * dh : where are the free samples 
 p : huh 
 we do n't give out free samples 
 this is a product to buy 
 dh : do n't you guys want to make money or what 
 p : uh yes but how can we make money if we give out free samples 
 me : this is just a shop 
 we are not like those outside <unk> their products ... * there were people outside by the supermarket <unk> beer and <unk> * dh : sorry what did you say 
 just a shop 
 just a shop 
 are you telling me you 're not a business but just a shop 
 do you even know what that means 
 me : yes the point of my statement is that we are an actual store 
 we are not <unk> sitting here with any <unk> deals or whatever promotions 
 dh : well thank you for <unk> you mistake with the first sentence 
 i think that you should tell your boss when you see him that he should send you to school so you can learn about business and all that 
 me : ... <unk> if he is <unk> ... uhm 
 i am the boss and i do have a degree in business what are we talking about right now 
 dh : oh ok. well it is always good to have one fool for a boss and one clever person for a boss and your partner seems to be a clever person 
 me : <unk> you calling me a fool 
 ** dh : yes ... i am a boss myself and i know how it is in a business with * using a local word for <unk> * do you know what that word means 
 do you even know the language here 
 next time i come i will bring my business book '' for you 
 me : <unk> i <unk> and no i do n't need that 
 thanks ... he was so casual about everything so i was really shocked about how he said it 
 it does n't help that i am a very patient and polite person who will try and avoid confrontations as much as possible but i obviously got pissed at my partner for not standing up for me as he just sat there in silence with his mouth wide open 
 i really really really wish i could swear at him 
 i will not sleep tonight 
 next <unk> start off these are going to be a short series of stories that i 've <unk> from my time working at an law enforcement officer <unk> retail store 
 despite the title it 's by no means meant to be political argument for or against guns 
 it 's just ... well you 'll see 
 and sorry for the length 
 i did a post about this store called you think you had a bad day 
 anyways onto the stories 
 <unk> <unk> before starting working where i work now i only had limited experience with guns <unk> weapons etc 
 i was nervous as all get out to work behind the gun counter 
 one of the people training me laid some ground rules about handling <unk> that should always be followed 
 these rules are : 1 the weapon is always loaded 
 2 even when you know the weapon is unloaded 
 it 's always loaded 
 3 always point the weapon at a safe direction 
 never at someone 
 see rules 1 and 2 for why 
 4 when handing a weapon over to someone make sure the <unk> is locked back and present the arms to them with the chamber so they can see that it 's cleared 
 5 when a weapon is handed to you always clear it 
 see rules 1 and 2 
 6 never point a <unk> at something that you do n't <unk> to kill 
 there is no such thing as shooting to injure 
 7 finger is never on the <unk> unless you are ready to kill whatever it is you are pointing at 
 i also developed a habit of not walking in front of pointed weapon 
 people will take a weapon and look down the <unk> usually <unk> at the back counter wall 
 i would wait to the side for them to raise or lower the weapon due to rules 1 and 2 notice a theme 
 most people will drop sight line raise the weapon 's <unk> to point at the ceiling lower the weapon down etc to let me pass 
 cool no problem 
 my first day behind the gun counter and the first customer i had behind there wanted to see a <unk> 17. i remove the weapon from the case clear it locked the slide back handed it to him and the proceeded to let the slide forward and take <unk> to see how it fit in his hands 
 problem 
 he was pointing it right at me 
 i moved to the side to get out of the line of fire '' and he followed me 
 sir could you please not point the weapon at me '' 
 why it 's not loaded '' 
 i do n't care please do n't point the weapon at me '' 
 stop being such a ... '' at this point a co-worker who 's been there for <unk> years reaches out grabs the slide from the top breaks the guys grip and tells him to leave 
 why do i have to leave '' 
 because you are n't being safe with the weapon 
 you need to leave now '' 
 fuck you 
 i want to see a manager '' 
 fine 
 my coworker calls out a name 
 down at the other end of the counter is the president of the company 
 the name called was his 
 my coworker tells the president what just happened including the fuck you '' part the president looks at me asks if i did have a gun pointed at me 
 yes sir '' 
 asked the customer if he did point the gun at me yeah but it was unloaded '' 
 the president looks at the guy and says matter of <unk> '' get the fuck out of my store and do n't come back '' 
 the guy started to cause a slight <unk> about it saying that he should n't be talking to a customer that way which was meet with a reply of you stopped being a customer when you pointed a gun at one of my employees '' 
 the guy was n't moving and was getting more and more angry 
 since we are cater to <unk> and military we usually have a <unk> police officer <unk> state police federal agent in store 
 the president pointed out that right now the guy is trespassing and <unk> the public and that there 's five officers looking at him ready to take him out of the store and to <unk> if he does n't leave now 
 officers were watching the scene unfold and were just waiting 
 i never seen so many different people from different agencies waiting to bust some jerk 's ass 
 fine 
 i 'm never coming here again '' 
 the customer said 
 i know and i do n't care '' the big boss said 
 <unk> we accept <unk> 
 ** after a while you get to feel for how heavy a weapon is unloaded and can tell when it is loaded even if you never held a loaded weapon before 
 there 's a certain weight to it and the balance is different 
 so we take <unk> 
 this guy comes in looking to trade his <unk> for credit to get a different <unk> 
 no biggie 
 we do this all the time 
 we tell him to bring in the weapon and make sure it 's cleared 
 he brings in the <unk> and hands it to me 
 it felt ... different 
 <unk> 
 are you sure this is cleared '' 
 yeah i cleared it before i put it in the car '' 
 so most of you know it 's not very smart to carry a loaded <unk> in a <unk> or have one in the chamber because it can accidentally <unk> 
 <unk> do n't usually have a drop safety and some hard bumps can make the hammer strike the shell causing an <unk> <unk> 
 it 's illegal at least in my state to have a loaded <unk> in the vehicle for these reasons 
 i rack the action and a shell goes flying out and hits the guy in the forehead 
 i follow the shell in flight in slow motion as i see it hit him in the head thinking what the fuck man '' 
 i rack it six more times 
 six more shells go flying out 
 he is told to put the shells back in his car and we 'll finish the trade when he comes back in 
 he also got a <unk> talking too by one of the <unk> 
 **i need a <unk> we sell anything an officer needs duty gear pants <unk> accessories for their weapons badges vehicle equipment you name it we have it or can get it 
 so a local officer comes in and needs a <unk> 
 we can help you with a <unk> 
 what weapon do you have '' 
 i do n't know '' 
 this happens more times than i feel comfortable with saying 
 if my sample size is any <unk> about other officers a good <unk> % do n't know what side arm they carry 
 we ask if he has it with him he says yes and we tell him to clear the weapon lock the slide back and bring it in and we can help him find a <unk> 
 he comes back in with a weapon cleared '' 
 we see that it 's a common weapon and we have different <unk> for it and show him the <unk> 
 as he is looking at the <unk> someone notices that he has a full loaded magazine in the the weapon 
 he drops the slide which <unk> a round 
 the gun is now hot live and ready to shoot 
 someone mentions this to him as he <unk> the weapon into the wrong <unk> 
 the weapon is stuck 
 fuck us a loaded gun is stuck in a <unk> 
 coworker gets that look of slight panic i grab the weapon and <unk> from the customer drop the magazine and keep the whole thing pointed down at the floor 
 i explained to the guy that we can try to take the weapon out but it 's got ta come off the floor and we have to take it our vault and for his safety and the safety of others he 's not allowed in there 
 i also tell him very politely how much of a dumb ass he is 
 he 's cool with this and does feel very stupid 
 i 'm ca n't really fault him too much because we failed at our job too make sure that it really is safe 
 so i take it to the vault and try to figure out how to get this things out safely 
 i call in two other more experience co-workers to help figure this out 
 after some cussing grumbling lots of <unk> and talk about taking a saw to the <unk> we finally got it free 
 the next day everyone got a <unk> and <unk> on weapon safety 
 **i 'm on the <unk> <unk> people come in all sorts of different <unk> and sizes 
 <unk> at least in my part of the woods tend to be on the bigger size of things 
 this big fellow comes in and is looking for <unk> gear for his <unk> <unk> 
 he has a purchase order from his department 
 he needs everything new body <unk> clothing <unk> <unk> chest <unk> sling for the <unk> he has to get new duty belt <unk> the whole nine 
 the problem 
 we did n't have anything that fit him 
 we can measure for body <unk> as those are custom made 
 but the sheet <unk> did n't go that big 
 pants 
 we did n't have anything close to his size 
 i had to take a measuring tape or two to get the guys waist size 
 we had to order a <unk> 
 for frame of reference i 'm a size 30 waist 
 when these pants finally came in myself and another guy got into each leg of the pants and had room for more people 
 of course he was offended that everything had to be custom made that we did n't have it in stock and would be up charged for the size which the department po did n't take into account 
 the horrible person in me was thinking that they were going to use him for <unk> entry as a human <unk> 
 i also joked with some other coworkers that the department should order all his gear in red and when he does bust down the door have him scream oh yeah '' 
 alright i think this is long enough 
 i have other stories that i 'll share at a later time 
 enjoy 
 edit : minor <unk> a quick tale of a customer on their high horse 
 around christmas time were were having a bogo sale on a very popular product 
 regular price was $ <unk> and most people understood this 
 we had a display right at the front of the store so <unk> could see 
 <unk> cue $ <unk> $ <unk> henceforth 
 i 'm in the middle of restocking the display when $ <unk> and her three children walk up 
 & gt $ <unk> : how much is this 
 & gt $ me : $ <unk> individually but they 're currently bogo 
 & gt $ <unk> : so if i wanted one i would pay $ <unk> 
 & gt $ me : no you 'd pay $ <unk> 
 & gt $ <unk> : but two of them are $ <unk> 
 $ <unk> and $ <unk> is $ <unk> 
 it 's basic math 
 are you an idiot 
 & gt $ me : i understand that but there items are bogo 
 buy one get one 
 you pay for one the other is free 
 & gt $ <unk> : but i only want one 
 if two of them is $ <unk> it stands to reason that one is $ <unk> 
 trust me i know what i 'm <unk> about 
 *turns to her three <unk> & gt $ <unk> : do n't end up like this idiot 
 basic math is a skill that can keep you out of places like this 
 $ <unk> struts away leaving me and a few customers around me <unk> 
 edit : <unk> was working returns yesterday 
 working returns for 9 hours is extremely <unk> and when people come in all <unk> toward the end of my shift i 'm in no mood to act like i care about their problems 
 these guys came in with 30 boards of <unk> some <unk> rolls and nails and other <unk> <unk> supplies 
 they only brought in the will call paperwork that 's what we give people if they order something and want to pick it up later 
 i told them i need the receipt since they paid cash or i 'd have to give them almost $ 500 in store credit 
 one of the guys guy 1 instantly gets mad and starts yelling at me and asking for a manager claiming that this is the receipt 
 it 's all they gave us '' 
 the other guy guy 2 says he knows what i meant by receipt '' and went to get it from the job site 
 guy 1 stayed behind with the cart and would randomly comment about how he wishes i could just return this stuff and give them their money back '' 
 i gave a very <unk> sorry '' and continued helping the other people in my line each time he said something 
 eventually guy 2 came back and i started the return process 
 i rang everything on the cart onto my register and told them the total 
 & gt guy 2 : hang on let me see if that 's right '' 
 he checked the paperwork and the total on there was more than what i had told them 
 they paid for 3 more sheets of <unk> than they brought in 
 guy 2 yelled at me because i ca n't count '' 
 so i counted the <unk> on their cart two more times and guy 1 does the same 
 & gt guy 2 : how many is on there 
 & gt me : 30 just like the first time 
 & gt guy 2 : guy 1 how many 
 & gt guy 1 : <unk> i 'm right and refuses to <unk> & gt me : i can have a manager come count them for you if you do n't believe me 
 so he tells me to just wait and let him see what 's on his cart 
 i continue helping more people and guy 2 comes up raging because they paid for <unk> sheets of <unk> and only picked up 30. he tells me repeatedly that they only had 30 on the job site and they brought all they picked up back to be returned 
 guy 1 is just sitting there fuming 
 over these 3 missing boards 
 i tried to interject several times to tell them i 'd refund <unk> <unk> for them because i just wanted them to leave 
 guy 2 finally calms down shuts up and lets me talk 
 & gt me : i can refund you for all <unk> sheets if you 'd listen to me 
 & gt guy 2 : well why did n't you say that 
 <unk> me by the <unk> me : do not touch me 
 if you touch me again i will call security and refuse to serve you 
 & gt guy 2 : <unk> something <unk> & gt me : ... so are you going to let me start this over and give you your money 
 so i rang all their stuff up and guy 2 just has to make sure i rang everything up right this time '' 
 i refund them their $ <unk> in cash yay empty register 
 and they finally leave 
 of course a manager shows up a few minutes after they left and asked me how i was doing 
 <unk> the eye catching title out of the way here 's a short story from a gas station clerk 
 let 's get started 
 younger kid about 10 or 11 and apparently does n't speak english comes up to my cash register and holds up a $ 20 bill and this exchange happens 
 tits '' 
 excuse me '' 
 tits '' 
 are you wanting gas '' 
 he nods 
 what pump number '' 
 <unk> '' 
 now i 'm still completely clueless but i 'm also kind of a genius too 
 i grab our store calculator and ask him to point to the number 
 and of course he points to the number six 
 thank you young sir 
 $ 20 on pump number tits 
 this happened to me several years ago when i was training as loss prevention at the big store with a <unk> face as a mascot 
 i had <unk> to another store to be trained by that stores loss prevention associate <unk> 
 we were walking the floor and it was my first day or two of training so we were watching a lot of people and also going over a lot of the do 's and do n't 
 being a very corporate company the rules were designed to protect the store from <unk> more then stop shoplifters and were long complicated and strict 
 one of these rules was the minimum age of a child that we were allowed to stop if we noticed shoplifting i believe it was 6 but i am not 100 % as it has been many years 
 this kid who looks to be 5-6 years old and has a look like he has gotten whatever he wants during his life walks by us and <unk> instantly <unk> him of being up to no good so we follow him 
 he <unk> it without his parents to the toy aisle 
 we see him with the grace expected of most kids his age take a <unk> cube off the shelf remove it from the packaging put the <unk> cube in his pocket and throw the packaging <unk> under a shelf 
 i am ecstatic because at first i think we are going to have an easy catch 
 <unk> informs me of the minimum age we can stop someone and that he looks too young to stop 
 this <unk> me a little then <unk> me as i ca n't stop this little shit from stealing from us 
 i pick the package up to take it out of our system later 
 we watch the kid for a little while longer as he goes back to his parents and then leaves his parents after a minute or two 
 he is alone again in another aisle acting like he owns the place and checking out anything he likes 
 at this point i <unk> we ca n't stop the kid or do anything about the <unk> cube 
 <unk> <unk> this and i decide to try and <unk> the kid 
 i wait at the far end of the next aisle under he comes down it 
 he turns the corner a minute later and i step out at the other end of the aisle and stop 
 in one hand is the torn packaging from the <unk> cube and my other hand i have my fingers tapping the packaging one finger at a time 
 i give the kid my best i got you fucker smug look while slowly shaking my head back and forth 
 he instantly freezes up and goes from smiling to bright red 
 his eyes start to water up a little and he knows he did not get away with it 
 i stand there just tapping the packaging for a couple seconds shaking my head until he <unk> out of the aisle and goes to find his parents 
 <unk> is <unk> at what i have just done 
 i ask her if what i did was wrong and she tells me that it was awesome 
 we watch the kid <unk> with his parents 
 the kid tries to keep a tough appearance up but spots me a little while later walk by and i just shake my head with a big <unk> look from <unk> 
 this put the kid over the top and after a minute or two his dad clearly sees something is wrong with him as the kid starts to break down 
 the tear works are in full swing but the kid wo n't say a thing to his parents and after a couple more minutes they all walk out the store 
 i do n't know if the kid ever dropped the <unk> cube or not or if he came clean with his parents 
 all i know is he was <unk> as they left the store and the parents were n't getting anything out of him then 
 i probably should n't have felt as good about what i had done as i did but that kid needed to taught a <unk> work in a dollar store in a small town 
 a couple is browsing over the deodorant specifically the spray stuff 
 i just so happen to be stocking items in this area so i 'm very near them as they 're shopping 
 & gt guy : here spray this and see what it smells like 
 the thing is our store has signs near the <unk> saying not to spray them because of allergy issues and spraying spray deodorant in the air is even worse especially since it 's a very small store it 'll stink it up for a long time 
 & gt me : can i just ask that you guys not spray that stuff in here 
 & gt guy : well how are we supposed to know what it smells like 
 girl <unk> deodorant in the air anyway and does the classic <unk> of <unk> into the cloud to smell it 
 i just leave it be at that point it 's not worth arguing over 
 i guess that since i 'm only 18 and look to be about 14 i do n't deserve to be listened to 
 : u fast forward and they are at my counter to check out 
 now since i 'm usually around the store doing other things stocking cleaning up etc. my counter has one of the classic ring <unk> for service '' <unk> 
 usually if someone sees me coming they obviously wo n't ring the <unk> 
 however even though i saw them ready to check out and was not even 5 feet from the counter when they were getting ready to check out the lady <unk> my <unk> extremely loudly and obnoxiously 
 i did n't say anything but was n't overly kind to them <unk> my usual how are you '' 
 and have a good day '' because fuck 'em 
 after they had left another guy comes to check out 
 he 's a <unk> and i recognized him 
 he says should i ring your <unk> like that too '' 
 with a little chuckle and then under his breath says morons '' 
 i hear this and reply you say what i wish i could '' 
 we both got a bit of a chuckle 
 jesus fuck some people 
 i mean really 
 that area of the store <unk> the rest of the <unk> 's another one from back when i used to work for reddit 's favorite office supply store 
 it was about half an hour from closing time on a sunday 
 i was making my usual rounds facing shelves filling empty spots picking up shredded packaging from stolen items the usual 
 one coworker was doing the same on the opposite side of the store and our manager that night was closing registers and doing cash office duties in between running the last open register 
 she 'll be <unk> for strong woman manager 
 as sundays usually were it had been dead most of the later afternoon and evening 
 as such we were not frequently checking the aisles for customers and i was n't all that surprised to find a middle-aged chinese woman who looked a little like ms. <unk> cw and her apparently mute daughter looking at our furniture displays without <unk> telling me about them on our radio headsets 
 we had a number of old displays on clearance and they <unk> towards the red signs and began looking closer 
 i offered assistance she refused and i started walking away 
 no sooner had i gotten back to my aisle i heard a slight <unk> from the direction of our furniture 
 i looked back over and cw had just lifted one of the shelves out of a <unk> and broke one of the <unk> that held the shelf up 
 cw and her daughter immediately began loading the <unk> onto their cart 
 i radioed <unk> to let her know what just went down then headed up front to watch 
 <unk> : hello did you find everything you were looking for today 
 cw : ah yeh <unk> you 
 <unk> : just the <unk> then okay your total is $ xx.xx cw : oh ah no discount 
 <unk> : it 's on clearance ma'am the original price was $ xxx.xx 
 60 % off is a pretty good deal 
 cw : oh ah it <unk> see 
 <unk> <unk> loose shelf to <unk> her point* <unk> some discount 
 <unk> : i ca n't sell it to you if it 's broken loose like that it 's not safe 
 sorry about that i 'll have <unk> help you find a similar one 
 <unk> to me then slaps a sticker on the <unk> that says damaged and defective '' * here i 'll d & amp amp d this show cw our other <unk> 
 <unk> takes the cart behind a counter cw follows her* cw : no <unk> one i like 
 you discount i buy 
 <unk> becoming agitated : i really ca n't ma'am it 's our policy and it 's for your safety 
 cw screwing up her face with anger : i want buy 
 you discount 
 <unk> : i 'm not going to do that 
 cw shouting : i buy 
 <unk> also shouting : you no buy 
 at this point cw takes out her phone and <unk> somebody 
 i 'm still standing at the register <unk> is at the counter across from me and we 're both just staring at her as she walks toward the door 
 cw in perfect english with no accent : yeah babe tell <unk> he can go home fucking bitch at store name would n't even let me buy some furniture 
 <unk> bye 
 me and <unk> exchange wtf looks 
 **tl dr - <unk> say : he who break thing in store is like a complete dick <unk> <unk> 
 **so we 've all had the parents come into our workplace and let their kids run <unk> the <unk> employees like crap 
 i once had a parent dump a kid 's <unk> bank on the counter and sit and laugh while i counted out all the change 
 but today i had a good experience with a parent and wanted to share 
 the little kid was about 5-6 years old and had clearly been saving for this toy for awhile 
 he had his money all wadded up in his hand ... like <unk> and stuff 
 his mom caught it as he was handing it to me and she crouched down to his level 
 mom : now look at what you 're about to give her 
 what would you think if someone gave that to you 
 would that be very nice 
 the little boy looked at his hand and kind of shrugged 
 mom : let 's unfold this and count it out 
 when you buy something you always hand the nice lady or man your money the way you 'd want your money handed to you 
 so that means you count it out and you unfold it and you put it in their hand and not on the counter 
 you would n't like it if someone just dropped it in front of you so that 's how we treat other people 
 i basically wanted to hug this mom 
 it took her kid an extra minute or so to <unk> his bills but the gesture was so nice 
 i love when parents teach their kids some respect and courtesy ... it 's so rare sometimes and it just really <unk> my heart when they <unk> work at a small bakery 
 we make fresh doughnuts every day and also serve coffee milk etc 
 most customers get the exact same thing every day and we know most orders by face 
 we work in a small community 
 there 's this one lady i ca n't stand and one day she pushed me over the edge 
 i 'm a manager now but when i was working the front counter one busy friday morning she showed up 
 i could see her desperately trying to look at the <unk> and pastry case along with what we had brewing for coffee 
 i was waiting on someone when she says from behind them you need to hurry up because i 'm going to be late for work '' 
 well you know what lady 
 maybe if you had planned your morning better you would n't be in this <unk> in the first place 
 <unk> 
 i took my sweet time making that coffee 
 edit : thanks for my very first gold 
 so this happened awhile ago 
 i work at the end of the mall right next to a <unk> playground so we get a lot of mothers with their <unk> kids 
 so a mother comes in with three kids 
 the mom is very intent on browsing and grabbing lots of items 
 the little girl is whining and doing a pee <unk> but the mom keeps <unk> her 
 we get them into a dressing room 
 when she leaves the dressing room one of the associates goes to clean it out and to our horror there is pee all over the floor 
 we clean it up 
 one of the associates tells the mother about it 
 the mother proceeds to yell at the child like she did n't know 
 like you somehow do n't know your child is in a urine soaked white dress and you were standing in it while you changed clothes 
 she then continues to shop as if nothing happened while the wet child following her around 
 she buys items briefly apologizes and leaves while telling the girl she 's going to take her and her <unk> to the playground 
 she then comes back two more times within the hour saying her kids are at the playground so she has some more time to look around 
 she bought more things each time 
 i dont even know what to say 
 i just nervously laughed 
 edit : cant spell tried to make the story <unk> 
 didnt have coffee when typing this 
 i work overnights at a gas <unk> store on the edge of the ghetto so my customers are a mix of affluent middle of the road people and hood rat '' types 
 being that i do the overnight shift i see a lot of strange <unk> pass through my doors 
 last night i had one of the best customer interactions ive had in a long time and surprisingly it was with a hood rat '' type dude
