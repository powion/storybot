 not me but a guy i worked with 10 years ago 
 i guess it counts as a revenge 
 i worked with a guy who really stuck it to his ex wife 
 when i met him he was working in a sporting goods store making 8 dollars an hour 
 he was not really like the other retail <unk> 
 he was older well groomed well spoken clearly educated etc 
 one night after work he gets into his car and i could n't help but notice that it was a very very nice newish <unk> 
 i asked him how he could afford it and he explained it to me : he had been an <unk> at a well known fortune 50 company which i will not mention the name of 
 pulling in <unk> with bonuses and stock options 
 he was married but the marriage fell apart and in the divorce she demanded that she get the house and 40 % of his wages 
 he and his lawyer somehow managed to get her to agree to let him keep the house in exchange for 75 % of his <unk> dollar figure or employer specified lol 
 as soon as she took the settlement he quit his job and looked for a minimum wage job 
 he said to me that she gets 75 % of nearly nothing now '' 
 he had other money stashed away so he did n't even need the job and he had the house and it 's <unk> as well 
 also no kids so there was no child support 
 just alimony 
 she was furious of course and tried to <unk> him but failed at least once and when she claimed that the settlement was not keeping her in the life style she was accustomed to he simply told the judge that the divorce was <unk> to him and he could no longer do his old job as a result 
 at least at that time she did not manage to get out of the deal 
 not sure how it all ended 
 but i thought it was fucking brilliant if not <unk> spiteful 
 he was a good employee too ... good with customers showed up on time no bullshit <unk> or anything like that 
 he claimed he loved each payday because it reminded him how little she was getting 
 this story begins almost a year ago 
 i received a call from an unknown number on my cell phone 
 it was an automated message to call a <unk> number in regards to serving me papers 
 i knew right away this may have been a collection agency 
 googled the number and confirmed it 
 now i have to disclose i did have identity theft almost 20 years ago 
 to this day i occasionally get calls from collection agencies trying to collect on some debt from 20+ years ago that was cleared 
 now most of the time when i get these calls i ask for their address to send in a dispute letter including the <unk> data for proof that i had identity theft 
 granted they should not be calling me but they apologize and i do n't get another call 
 plus they usually mail me back and said they closed the account 
 well i go to call this person and i got to say the call was interesting 
 this woman answered and i gave her my information 
 she started rattling off a debt that was back in 1995. i let her finish and i told her that i had no knowledge and there was identity theft 
 and as soon as i said that she freaked out 
 she kept saying she knew the debt was mine and i 'm going to pay 
 i kept telling her that i wanted to mail a letter 
 but she flat out refused 
 when i told her i knew my rights she said that i had the right to pay the debt 
 she then said that she is going to put a lien on my huge pretty house '' her words and she was describing the house to the letter 
 she also said she is going to put a lien on my <unk> that she sees '' in the drive way 
 and she said that my gate in the front wo n't stop the <unk> 
 she then hung up 
 now i knew better 
 all she did was get my info from public records and then saw my house on google street view 
 my guess is that she tried to push this intimidation on other people that know better 
 so far it appeared to be a very <unk> company 
 i also had phone recordings when i called in 
 and they were legal as i asked her if phone calls can be recorded for quality control purposes 
 she said of course 
 and i said thank you i 'll take that as my consent '' 
 i would of just let this go and just say this lady was crazy 
 but i kept getting the automated phone calls and i could n't block them as they were unknown 
 i googled the company and i thought they were in ohio 
 a couple of flags that led me to believe this was that the person who owned this company in ohio was being <unk> with charges whom was an attorney 
 i placed a complaint with the ohio attorney general 
 they could n't find any information on what i was submitting 
 they did call the phone number i gave them and the attorney general told me they would stop from calling me 
 but that is all the attorney general could do 
 i also complained to the federal consumer finance bureau whom is supposed to be looking into these issues 
 but they blew my off 
 well three months later i called this number 
 i had an idea of maybe pressing buttons when i called in to see if i could get more information about the company through the <unk> 
 well that paid off 
 as soon as i pressed 0 i got a different company name 
 i googled that company and got tons of complaints 
 this lead me to the company existing in ny 
 i complained to the attorney general of ny with all of my info 
 i done quite a bit of research over the next couple of weeks and found out a whole bunch of information such as the owner 
 found out that the address where the company no longer received mail was at the owner 's address their facebook account etc.. i then got another one of those unknown phone calls 
 but this time it 's a different company 
 i 'm sure you get what i am getting at 
 the company just keeps changing the name but the parent company still calls 
 i finally had enough of this 
 i get a private investigator involved and they were quite satisfied with all the information i got so far 
 so i let him do his business 
 well he calls me back saying that this company is n't even registered and it 's ran by this one lady 
 i find out the rude lady whom i am talking to is the supposed owner but not running a legitimate business 
 i got a process server to file a claim in ny 
 granted i think i could have done it where i was at 
 but i was heading up to that area in ny anyway as i had some family reasonably close 
 problem was she was not able to be served 
 the house which she owned she was not able to be served at 
 either she was not there or was staying somewhere else 
 well my private investigator started sending out friend requests to her and the people in her friends lists 
 well her friends and then she accepted the facebook request 
 my private investigator found out that she cheated on her boyfriend about a month ago since she posted that crap 
 the private investigator gave me an idea of trying to reach her boyfriend and if he can lead us to serve her i will give him $ 500 
 well we did that and sure enough we were finally able to serve this lady at her parents house about 20 miles from where she was at 
 i fly up to ny and since it 's small claims it 's just me and this lady 
 for some reason her mother is there too but she is not representing 
 i give the judge all of my info i had over the months and how she broke the law 
 she broke debt collection laws and threats over the phone 
 after the judge heard all the trouble i had with these calls and how she hid her identity purposely the judge gave me the maximum amount of $ 3000 
 in ny small towns and <unk> are limited to $ 3000 
 after the case i heard her mother loudly whispering but i heard it you better hope he does n't take your house '' your great <unk> built this with his own bare hands '' i was thinking 
 hmmm it would be sweet revenge if i could actually put a lien on the house '' well lo and behold i found out the house had a second mortgage attached to it 
 with the property value of the house and if it sold i would n't end up getting the lien money since the secondary mortgage was almost as much as the house 
 i was then contemplating how i was going to get the money from this lady 
 my private investigator calls me five months later and said her house is going into foreclosure 
 i get a proxy to bid for me 
 but as in most foreclosure actions the bank buys it back as an <unk> 
 i decided to send in a low ball offer to buy the house a couple of months later 
 the bank accepted my offer 
 my guess is that it 's a small town and trying to get the right market was an issue 
 you may be wondering why i even bought this house 
 well here 's why 
 this bitch threatened to put a lien on my house with no <unk> 
 well guess what i fucking took her house 
 it was completely worth it 
 it did n't cost me too much and i had the money 
 the house is actually in decent shape just a little small 
 plus it will be a nice summer home when i go to visit my relatives 
 oh and i decided to rub in salt to the wound 
 i sent a letter to her parent 's address letting them know i took the house 
 i told them that if her daughter would n't be in the business of scamming people they may not have lost the house 
 i also go to find out that the attorney general of ny is now investigating this lady 
 i hope they throw the book at her 
 not going to mention the collection agency but if you stopped getting phone calls from them you 're welcome 
 edit : fixed some minor grammar since a couple of people were <unk> on me 
 happy 
 update : i 'm surprised this post got so much attention 
 first of all for the people who gave gold 
 thank you 
 i know that some people are calling bull shit to my story 
 all i can say is that this is 100 % true 
 i tried to give as much detail as possible 
 i just want to address all the people giving me a hard time over the grammar 
 i did n't intend this to be a newspaper article 
 everything was typed out free form as i wanted to get the entire story out there 
 i apologize if that really <unk> you from enjoying the <unk> other people did enjoy it 
 i considered going through and <unk> for the grammar mistakes 
 however i am sure these same people would find something else to be negative about 
 having said that i do not have any ill feelings towards the negative people or the <unk> 
 this is the internet and my feelings are n't hurt 
 i love you people as much as the people who enjoyed the article 
 i wish i could say this is my story but it 's not 
 this one is courtesy one of my closest friends 
 for reference i 'll be referring to him as bp '' 
 slightly not safe for work i suppose ... i 'd rather tag it and it not be than not tag it and have someone 's boss walk up and read it : d also names and tiny details are changed or <unk> but the overall story is legit 
 a few years ago bp was dating this girl 
 he really dug her and did everything he could to please her 
 he was a reasonably funny dude not bad looking and he <unk> for a band so he had his choice of a few ladies but chose this one because he was really fond of her 
 bent over backwards for her so to speak 
 after the relationship goes on for awhile he finds out she 's been cheating on him 
 and it did n't just start she 's been cheating on him since they were courting 
 apparently his love for her was n't mutual and she just refused to give up other guys even after their own relationship seemed to get serious 
 bp was furious but he was n't the type to shit in her cereal beat up the other guys etc 
 but he wanted to get back at her somehow some way 
 a few days later we 're all out drinking hanging out hitting the bar circuit having a good time when who else but his ex 's mom actually shows up 
 ex 's mom gets liquored up with us when bp actually saw his opportunity for revenge 
 so he sweet talks the mother to the point where she ends up bringing him back home with her and then ... you guessed it 
 he had sex with his ex 's mother 
 but the story gets better 
 <unk> he decides to get up and go to the kitchen to get a drink 
 not putting anything on but a t-shirt he walks into the kitchen and opens the fridge 
 at this point his ex who was out herself comes in and runs into him naked from the <unk> down in her fridge 
 she screams at him what the fuck are you doing here '' 
 nonchalantly he replies getting some orange juice '' 
 **tl dr good friend 's long term girlfriend cheats on him gets revenge by sleeping with her mom gets caught in the kitchen by his ex and says getting some orange juice 
 ** edit : holy crap front page 
 thanks guys 
 edit 2 <unk> somehow this made best of '' so this post made front page twice 
 since today is my birthday i find it an amusing present in a weird sort of way 
 however i do wish whoever posted it to <unk> had clarified the title a little <unk> seems people think i 'm delivering about the safe 
 i do n't know anything about the safe beyond what you guys know ... and i imagine if that op finally delivers it 'll stay on the front page for awhile ... the year was 2008 and i was 9 years into operating a landscape company 
 i had done <unk> well for myself being able to purchase a home pay off student loans and start a family 
 i employed 4 people during the what i call work season which for us is march through november 
 december through february we lay off our workers and go on <unk> for the most part 
 side note our company focused mainly on maintenance and in the pacific north west once all the <unk> are picked up from the autumn there really is n't much maintenance to be done 
 i had that year developed a relationship with a home builder who hired me to care for his personal home and very much liked our work 
 he asked us to start bidding on installing the <unk> to the homes he built 
 sounds easy right 
 well remember we focused mainly on maintenance so my crew did n't have a ton of experience in the install detail of landscape and the homes this guy built were not track homes '' or your cookie cutter type neighbors you find in the suburbs 
 no a small home for him was 3500 sq ft on a <unk> sq ft lot and an average size he developed was <unk> to 10k sq ft home with all the <unk> and <unk> 
 he was more generous in his landscape budgets than many of the contractors i 'd met and we were off to what i had hoped would be great partnership 
 we finished the first 4 projects he handed us and it was now the beginning of december when my maintenance side of things drops off 
 this home builder came to me and asked if i would like to keep my maintenance crew working for the winter working for him 
 i knew his next home project was n't set to break ground till late january so i asked what he had in mind 
 he told me that he and his son had been <unk> with spray foam insulation in their homes and had decided to invest into purchasing equipment to start there own company 
 to purchase the equipment on this level was about 100k 
 i said i would talk to the crew and get back to him 
 the next week we signed a contract to work with him for three months at a specified pay rate for five of us 
 he was confident he had enough work to keep us busy for the next three months 
 first job was insulating this incredible house for this plastic <unk> who <unk> no expense for the gadgets and material that he put into his home 
 next was government buildings on fort <unk> 
 next was new apartment <unk> 
 etc etc.. now this builder who i was friends with was not my day to day boss while insulating it was his son who is younger than i and a bit of a jerk 
 but we got along fine and all seemed well 
 the father owned the insulation company but had very little to do with it on a day to day basis 
 hardly saw him for three months 
 now being a contractor myself i was used to not getting paychecks every two weeks like most working folks 
 i would get paid once a month from my maintenance accounts for the previous month of service and it did n't all come in at <unk> 
 sometimes people forget to pay on time 
 my crew though was used to getting paid in a <unk> manner 
 and after the first month of work and receiving no check from my new boss i inquired when to expect a check 
 he assured me that once the checks started rolling in that we would see our <unk> i totally get how that works especially for a new company trying to get off the ground 
 so i paid my guys to keep the peace on my end and my boss and i worked out an agreement that i would keep track of everything paid and that he would cut me a check once he was able to 
 i also had an outstanding landscape invoice out with the father of over 10k that i was n't really worried about because he was not always super quick about <unk> not that i had to <unk> him about it but you understand 
 now we are at the end of february of 2009 and it was time to gear up for the new season of landscape maintenance and put my crew back to work outside 
 still no payment from insulation or last landscape project 
 things got ugly real fast as i started daily phone calls to the son now that we did n't see each other as often 
 i called the father who more or less ignored me 
 the son stopped answering my calls/texts etc 
 the father never had a straight answer for me 
 now mid april of 2009. most communication has stopped on their end 
 i filed a contractors lien on the landscape project to be paid out before the house sold 
 which prompted a call from the father to invite me to his home for lunch and talk 
 i accepted thinking he was going to offer me a deal of some kind based on my past history with him 
 he basically told me that he had been over the years screwed out of money by different people and that it was something that i was going to have to learn to live with 
 my response i 've been screwed out of money that people owe me as well just not by anyone i considered a friend '' 
 i left his house determined to stick it to him 
 may 5 2009 i started a spray foam insulation company with the same level of equipment that he had but about a year less experience than he had 
 may 7th i get a call from the father asking a landscape question acting as if we were on normal terms 
 my response was oh i do n't landscape anymore i spray foam '' 
 what are you talking about 
 he asked 
 when i explained to him that i was operating a spray foam insulation company he ended the phone call rather quickly 
 i then receive a phone call from his son 5 min later who had ignored my calls for the last many weeks threatening me that he would destroy my hopes of making it as an <unk> and that no little landscaper '' <unk> make it in this community 
 side note with my newly formed company there was now approximately 4-5 companies in the pacific north west performing this kind of service 
 it is a small circle of people in the insulation world and the word gets around pretty quick who does what etc 
 our very first job was handed to us by our material supplier which happened to be his '' supplier and that job was a fix '' 
 apparently that very first job we had worked on that plastic <unk> house was insulated incorrectly and poor <unk> 
 luckily my only involvement on that house was prep work and clean up 
 we ended up removing all of the insulation and <unk> it 
 about a <unk> job which the owner of the house turned around and sued my old boss for and won 
 we then acquired the government contract at fort <unk> that he had because of poor communication on his part 
 anyway we <unk> took apart his company by being better and honest with people 
 the story spread in the spray foam insulation world and we became somewhat hero like in this region because they had screwed so many people over 
 oh and at that time if you might remember the housing market took a giant dump and guess who had 4 very large houses sitting out there that could n't sell 
 yep the father who ended up going bankrupt by mid <unk> the son on the other hand kept his head above water somehow a bit longer 
 but in <unk> of <unk> i got a call from a repo man asking if i new the son and where to find his spray foam equipment 
 my father in law happen to be an retired cop and pi and i put him on the case to find said equipment 
 two days later he called with the address and specific location of the equipment which was behind a barn on an island with the tires aired down 
 i made the call to the repo man and two hours later he called me from his lot as he was pulling in with a very large trailer behind his truck asking where he could send the <unk> check 
 i kept the insulation business for about 3 years before being bought out by another company 
 i also kept the landscape company and still run it to this day 
 moral to the story <unk> may work in the dirt and seem simple but piss one off and they will ruin you 
 our lovely hoa has decided that should you choose to decorate your exterior for the winter holiday season your lighting may not have 2 <unk> bulbs that are the same color unless all of your lights are the same color 
 last year i hung my usual blue lighting and intentionally <unk> in one red <unk> just to piss off our hoa cc & amp r enforcement officer '' 
 it took 2 days before i had a friendly phone call another 3 days until i received a certified letter and an additional 5 days until a $ 50 violation fine showed up 
 the holidays passed and i continued to fight the fine 
 i refused to pay it 
 late fees started to build and eventually i was summoned to an association meeting 
 i compiled a list of some of the most insane hoa <unk> i could find to compare to the insanity i was dealing with 
 i admitted that i changed the <unk> intentionally and plead with the hoa board to have a little reason 
 it turns out that while a majority vote was needed to pass a new regulation a unanimous vote is needed to change or <unk> a regulation 
 all of the hoa board members with the exception of <unk> who just so happened to be the old woman who cited me for the violation to begin with agreed that the rule was unnecessary 
 this old hag proceeded to argue that even though she did n't live on my street my lighting had ruined her christmas and presumably the christmas of everyone on my street 
 finally someone on the board pointed out that while they needed a unanimous vote to change the regulation they only needed a majority vote to remove another member of the board 
 an immediate vote was taken and the lighting nazi was removed from the board 
 a motion was made to <unk> on my case and it was immediately dismissed 
 i used to work as medic in the canadian oil patch good job for the most part as it pays more and is less stressful than ground ambulance 
 i did a few years responding to 911 calls then took some time off to live in new zealand 
 when i came back to canada i was strapped for cash and looking to get back to work quickly so i took a job with the first company that called me back 
 interview goes well i get a start date a daily wage rate and for the time could n't be happier 
 doing this job was <unk> of cake basically it involves sitting in a truck with a <unk> mobile treatment center stuffed in the box think pick up truck with camper 
 mostly the reason medical staff is required has to do with <unk> <unk> 
 if you are x amount of time from hospital and doing high risk '' work you need dedicated <unk> 
 i spent 20 days away from home at this remote work site where they were fracking gas wells and by the 20th day could n't wait to get home i was excited to get my first real pay check in nearly a year and planning on first paying off some bills and then getting <unk> drunk 
 this is where shit went sideways on me - i tore open the mail box like a child on christmas morning grabbing my check i headed down to the bank 
 opening the letter i froze wtf 
 i 'm missing over 1,000 $ - a cursory glance at my attached <unk> revealed i was getting paid 75 $ per day less than i expected 
 okay '' i think to myself must be a mistake i 'm sure they 'll <unk> it for me '' 
 the next day i went down to the office and met with asshat manager and a few other office people 
 we sat down and talked it over and i asked if it was a mistake and when could i be expecting the rest of my pay 
 am looked at me squarely and said you wo n't be getting that extra money i have discussed it with the rest of management and we have agreed no one told you that you would be getting 400 $ / day 
 we only pay 325 $ to start '' well i 'm not saying you all told me i would start at 400 $ 
 you am told me i would get 400 the day you hired me '' he always had this creepy little smirk on his face and i began to understand the <unk> reason kinda looked like the pedo smile '' <unk> at me he began why would i start you at the top wage 
 we 'd have no where to go you would n't ever be able to get a raise and that would n't be fair now would it 
 i replied that does n't bother me besides you told me i would get 400 $ '' with that smirk still plastered across his face he said i do n't remember that did you get it in writing 
 at this point i knew he got one over on me and while internally livid i tried not to <unk> any <unk> 
 no i guess i did n't <unk> well there you go so let 's get this settled while you are here you 'll get 325 $ as a day rate and we 're all in agreement 
 is that okay 
 can you live on that 
 i agreed without too much <unk> and left <unk> cursing him and his <unk> down the generations 
 i start looking for jobs immediately as i 'm not about to continue working for that asshole if i do n't have to but remembering at the same time i 'm not suited for unemployment 
 3 days into my scheduled 10 off i get a call from am hi <unk> can you work tomorrow 
 i 've got a job and our medic is sick it 's really important they 're doing a large gas <unk> in the morning '' sure '' i says 
 great you 'll have to come by tonight and grab a truck i wo n't be there so <unk> give you the gate code to the yard and leave the keys in the gas cap '' 
 you need to drive out to site tonight and be there for the 6am start '' you bet boss '' i said barely keeping my voice even 
 at this point i decided to say fuck it unemployment is n't all that bad '' fast forward to 7am the next day 
 the phone call i was expecting from am arrives where the fuck are you '' 
 what do you mean 
 you needed to be at the <unk> for 6am 
 i just got a call from the oil company 
 where the fuck are you 
 i 'm at home what 
 you were going on this job we talked last night 
 hmmm i do n't remember this ... did you get it in writing 
 i promptly hung up and then turned my phone off 
 now they could n't start that job and it was my company 's fault 
 if you know anything about fracking it 's <unk> expensive and they ended up having to pay for all the labor costs during the delay 
 i got threats of legal action and such so i know it cost them thousands 
 i hope it was worth it 
 i do n't burn my bridges i take off and nuke them from <unk> ... it 's the only way to make sure 
 it 's been almost 8 years that company eventually folded and nothing ever came of their <unk> rattling 
 i still get a good chuckle when i imagine that asshole going red in the face 
 tldr company did n't pay me what i deserved and it ended costing them thousands more 
 this happened a couple of years back 
 i 'll try to keep it as short as i can with as much detail as i can 
 i was married for 12 years 
 my wife was a wonderful person 
 we had many laughs together and many great times as well 
 she also happened to be full of shit 
 between the years of <unk> she had multiple affairs including : * my daughters 1st grade teacher * the security guard in the building where she worked * the son of one of her friends this went on for 3 years behind my back 
 i had no clue she was a cheating bitch 
 during the summer of <unk> i discovered the affairs 
 i confronted her with it and she did n't deny it 
 but instead of you know taking responsibility for it she told me she was running away to be with some dude she met on the internet 
 i thought she was joking and did n't take it seriously 
 the next morning she was gone 
 neither me nor my daughter saw her for a year and a half 
 it hurt her a lot because she really looked up to her mom 
 finally i got sick of hoping she would come back and i filed for divorce on the grounds of <unk> 
 she eventually came back and tried to act like nothing happened 
 did n't matter because i got full custody 
 she also tried to sue me for alimony but that failed miserably as well 
 the revenge 
 letting her fuck herself over 
 she lost all of her friends is in a shit ton of debt and her parents hate her 
 she works as a waitress at a restaurant and is living with random people off of cl 
 but what i know hurts her the most is my daughter who 's now 17 wants absolutely nothing to do with her 
 she got her visitation rights terminated by the courts so she ca n't see her either 
 the most pro revenge anyone could take is letting someone fuck themselves over 
 it 's priceless 
 edit : thank you whoever gave me the gold 
 when i was in the 3rd grade there were a bunch of notorious bullies 
 a bunch of 6th grade girls who thought they were hot shit 
 they were always pushing the little kids in elementary around shoving them out of their way and generally making their lives miserable 
 remember that girls tend to be quite a bit bigger than boys at that age so when you 're a <unk> 8 yr old boy who 's about 4 ft 2 tall a 5 ft 2 '' girl 's one handed shove might as well been a mountain giant <unk> a flea 
 one day after being <unk> shoved <unk> out of the way in the halls of the school i had enough 
 i stood up and told the girls that we were all sick of them and if they wanted to fight they would get one 
 this resulted in spontaneous fits of laughter 
 i told them we 'd meet at the end of lunch behind the hill by the playground where the teachers could n't see and we 'd fight 
 but not just me and the <unk> 
 i told her to bring all her bully friends because they were all going to get it 
 me and my friends <unk> her and her friends 
 they <unk> said i was a dead man and walked away talking about the ridiculous beating they were going to dish out on us <unk> '' 
 first recess i talk to my male classmate friends 
 they agreed they were sick of being bullied and would all fight 
 but we knew we did n't stand a chance unless we got more help 
 so we hatched a plan 
 not just my friends not just all the boys in my class or even in my grade 
 *every boy in the school in grade 3 or <unk> 
 we split into 2 groups and started <unk> 
 word started getting around there was going to be a big fight 
 lunch rolls around and we are <unk> the playground 
 japanese kid practicing high kicks 
 come practice on the grade 6 girls 
 bunch of kids playing red <unk> 
 more fun if you throw yourselves into a bunch of bullies 
 these girls had earned a lot of animosity throughout the year and we had no problem getting everyone into our cloud of kids 
 by the time all my friends had met up it felt like we had a monstrous <unk> army 
 in reality it was <unk> close to <unk> kids 
 some who did n't even want to fight but was just coming to see what the fuss was all about 
 when i got to the top of that hill it was like <unk> the <unk> <unk> his standard 
 our swarm <unk> that hill causing those 8 girls to just <unk> 
 turn white and freeze in place 
 we did n't even give them a chance to <unk> and just charged down that hill at full speed 
 some of them screamed as they were being bounced around like <unk> <unk> balls by the stream of little bodies throwing themselves at them 
 all of them were knocked down 
 standing over a screeching girl who i had just bowled over 
 hearing her screech while she was getting <unk> by tiny fists and feet i felt a great glory wash over me 
 i <unk> the chaos with pride as the girls started getting up and fleeing in tears 
 <unk> all the boys in our class were called into the principal 's office 
 afterwards 8 of us were given <unk> after school <unk> and our parent 's were called 
 teacher was sympathetic as she knew of the bullying and the detention was just free play with my close pals who pulled this off 
 **tl : dr** bunch of grade 6 girl bullies expect to beat up a few little kids and swept away by a sea of em instead 
 **edit** for clarity and <unk> the music industry certainly the <unk> side of things we 've all done shitty gigs 
 the sort of gig s that you know from the moment you get booked that it 's not going to be fun 
 being female in this industry this sometimes works in my favour sometimes not 
 so i get a call from a promoter who wants to put on a show locally and i got recommended to supply all the sound i run a small pa rental company 
 i ask him the usual questions what 's the load in/out time '' 
 what 's the technical spec of the band '' 
 what 's your budget '' 
 etc etc 
 we agree a fee after <unk> of telephone <unk> 
 we are both happy with this fee it was <unk> <unk> which is very reasonable for the personnel and equipment being provided 
 the only thing i always insist on when i 'm working for somebody i do n't know / have never worked with before is that i require <unk> funds upon arrival at event <unk> a <unk> that i rattle off many times a year and i never have any issues 
 me or my crew will bring £50k worth of gear to your event we will sometimes even start setting it up 
 but as soon as possible you need to pay us 
 so this promoter showed us where to load in to this <unk> hall type venue 
 while my guys were walking around the venue checking the usual things like <unk> outlets pa flying points etc i took the promoter to one side and produced my printed invoice and said my usual spiel ... me : i know you are real busy we need to start setting up so if you can sort payment now then i do n't need to bother you again '' 
 he did the whole <unk> guilty at his shoes routine promoter : umm i do n't have all of you money right now im waiting for my business partner he has your money 
 he has it all 
 can you wait for him to arrive '' 
 me : ok its not a problem what time is he due to arrive '' 
 promoter : around an hour or two before the doors open he has to set up the bar so he wo n't be later than this '' 
 me : look i 've not worked with you but in the spirit of future business relations i will take payment in full anytime before the start of the show '' 
 promoter : thanks he has the money it wo n't be a problem '' 
 me : lol i know if i do n't have the money before the start of the show then i 'm not turning the pa on '' 
 said jokingly but with a stern face 
 so my guys setup everything we work <unk> for the next few hours the band arrive and we all get on well together 
 they are friends of the promoter and do n't seem as bothered about the money as we do 
 i mentioned that this was the first show with this promoter and the drummer who was the informal leader of the band said the promoter has a different sound co. every time they gig 
 this gives me and the two crew guys cause to look at each other <unk> 
 we finish soundcheck and as the band head to their <unk> room we sit around stageleft watching the audience spilling in 
 **showtime is <unk> <unk> ... ** i see the promoter hanging around <unk> so i pop over to see him 
 me : hey promoter everything ok so far 
 happy with everything '' 
 promoter : yes very happy everything 's perfect band say soundcheck went well looking forward to the show ... '' me : thats good lets get payment out the way and i can leave you alone to enjoy the show '' 
 promoter : errr listen <unk> have been slow for this show can i pay you afterwards '' 
 me : i thought you had sold 1200 
 at <unk> a head minimum that makes at least <unk> you should have more than enough to pay '' 
 i 'm being kind but very firm 
 im sorry but you need to sort out payment before the show we 've <unk> £50k worth of this gear here we 've even set it all up and so far you 've had all this for free ... sorry but i ca n't do the show without payment upfront 
 once we 've done a few shows together and we 've built up a trust then i can help you out but this is our first show and i have rules sorry '' 
 promoter : ok let me see what i can do ... '' <unk> <unk> to <unk> ... ** my team is ready to go but we are anxious by now about the <unk> promoter 
 the band are with us stageleft and ready to go onstage 
 they know the situation 
 they know we 've not been paid yet but they do n't seem that bothered 
 they are friends with the promoter and seem to side with him 
 i 'm almost thinking about starting the show and getting the money afterwards but i stop myself 
 'do n't break your rule i tell myself 
 **showtime <unk> 1 minute ... ** the promoter comes over to stage left and tells the band to go onstage he will <unk> them on 
 my team are all in position behind the mixing desks etc ready to go on my say so 
 i <unk> the promoters shirt by his elbow and look <unk> at him where 's payment '' 
 i ask 
 promoter : yeah yeah smiling lets get the band onstage and i <unk> and get it for you while they are on 
 me : but ... as promoter walks onto stage <unk> '' 
 i call after him almost shouting 
 i am furious i know that it is impossible to kill the audio <unk> and that riot may well break out if i did this 
 much easier to not put myself in the position to start with ... i glance over at the front of house engineer who is looking at me for guidance ... i did the classic <unk> hand draw across the throat signal for <unk> it 
 both my audio guys hit the global <unk> on their desks and the promoter walks over to the centre of the stage and speaks into a microphone ... but nothing and i mean nothing comes out ... utter fucking silence ... the crowd <unk> they cheer then they <unk> again ... the promoter looks over at me angrily <unk> i gesture to him rubbing my fingers together in the other <unk> recognised gesture of <unk> me my fucking money 
 things are about to get heated so i grab a mic we have setup <unk> but out of sight of the audience we call them <unk> of god mics or emergency mics 
 ladies and gentlemen sorry but due to a foreseeable hitch this show will be delayed by <unk> '' cue audience <unk> and lots of tension building up ... a lot of sweat dripping from the promoter instantly for fear of his reputation 
 no word of a lie i had full payment in cash in my hand within <unk> 
 the show went ahead and i went on to do several other shows with this promoter he never tried to screw me again 
 i was asked to submit this comment as a post about one of my college buddies pro revenge on his cheating girlfriend of 2 years 
 he found out that she was cheating on him and he was literally crying in his car for a few days -- he was planning on marriage and kids and the white picket fence with her 
 he did n't tell her he knew he told her that he was going to his parents house for a few days to help them with some repairs 
 instead he hung out with us and cried literally cried in front of his buddies for a couple of days we helped him get out of it 
 he <unk> up and told us how he was going to destroy her and i did n't even understand it at the time 
 but he was headed to a famous law school and was thinking way ahead of us 
 he drove to his girlfriend 's mothers house over an hour outside of town with her items from his apartment nicely boxed up and said he wanted to leave them with her for gf 
 gf 's mom and him had met several times he had gone to their thanksgiving etc 
 gf 's mom was like ok but why 
 not <unk> anything was wrong 
 and he said something brief like i do n't think we 'll be seeing each other again but i needed to get this box back to her 
 but thank you for everything you 've done for me 
 i 'm sorry it did n't work out '' 
 gf 's mom is stunned and tries to ask why and what and everything but my friend just starts crying i do n't think intentionally and runs off and drives away 
 he never broke up with the gf -- never even contacted her -- she heard about it from her mom who called her immediately and he received confused and angry texts from the <unk> on his drive home 
 a little while later at least a couple of weeks he gets an email from the gf 's mom i do n't remember the specifics but it was not i apologize for my daughter '' but more like i hope you find a woman who loves you <unk> '' or something to that effect 
 he responded with something like thanks your note means a lot to me '' -- nothing negative 
 dude is now a up-and-coming lawyer and still gets texts from the ex saying that she constantly hears from her mom how she ruined it with the one good guy she had and how she does n't deserve to be happy 
 friend has never responded to one text and blocked her from fb 
 of course this was all 100 % planned - my friend wanted the hurt to come from someone who would stay in his ex 's life not from someone who would be quickly forgotten 
 he deliberately created a <unk> in the closest relationship that two women can have 
 and all in a friendly <unk> conversation with no harsh words or accusations 
 edit : my friend said he would join this thread a little later today well this story starts out like quite a few others have 
 i being in the u.s. army become attracted to a woman whom i end up marrying 
 at first she 's all i could ever ask for in a woman 
 sweet caring one hell of a <unk> 
 does n't really like video games like i do but makes an effort to get into them so we can spend time together doing something we both enjoy 
 & amp nbsp let 's call her thundercunt or tc for short for reasons you will soon know 
 & amp nbsp i met tc through one of the other soldiers i worked with who we will call bb battle buddy since he was not at fault in this 
 it was in the middle of the week and i had just gotten a work order finished up and was taking a quick break for a drink of water 
 i heard bb asking a few other soldiers if they were open for a date for this coming weekend 
 now i knew from a few other friends that bb was straight so i was curious as to why he was asking 
 & amp nbsp long story short bb had a female friend who was looking for a date for a movie that coming weekend 
 i offered to go with his friend <unk> mistake and she and i hit it off rather well and continued to see each other 
 months pass it has n't been enough time for me to consider marriage yet but she has some spontaneous <unk> <unk> and they were legit spring up out of nowhere 
 since these only seemed to happen in her sleep and my command would n't let me stay <unk> with her without being married ... & amp nbsp <unk> & amp nbsp we got a courtroom wedding 2 weeks later 
 the added bonus 
 not only could i stay with her while she slept to be ready in case of another episode but my <unk> would fully cover her medical costs 
 i was happy she was happy i got to tell my command now you ca n't stop me from staying with her 
 and we all lived happily ever after 
 & amp nbsp except we did n't 
 things went well for a while as i described at the beginning of the post but after a bit i started noticing things 
 things like her needing to take her mother to the doctor 's office quite frequently her mother was sickly so i did n't think much of it at first or needing to head to the walmart 1 town over because the one in our town did n't have what she needed in stock 
 & amp nbsp things like the car i bought and let her use seen parked in a lot next to several different trailer parks in a month 
 & amp nbsp well as luck would have it right as i started to get suspicious i came down on orders to <unk> to korea 
 so <unk> the investigation until i was able to continue i packed kissed my wife goodbye and let the army send me where they wanted me 
 i spent a year in korea then came down on orders for texas 
 i went there 
 it was there that i found out exactly what was going on courtesy of her mom brother and her aunt and uncle 
 & amp nbsp this woman was sleeping with 60 not even kidding in the slightest different men most of them soldiers 
 her excuse to her family was frizzmaster is gay and does n't want to come out 
 so he 's pointing out the men i can sleep with since he knows that they 're clean '' 
 & amp nbsp so basically this woman is using me as a paycheck and meal ticket and screwing everything with a <unk> that happens to be male 
 the icing on the cake is that 2 weeks after i get the good news she calls me and confesses to cheating on me ... <unk> 
 the only reason she confessed 
 she was pregnant there was no way i could be the father given that i was in a different state at the time ... .and the father was african american 
 & amp nbsp i am very much **not** african american having been called neon white '' on more than one occasion due to my <unk> <unk> 
 so there was no possible way this child would look like me at all 
 so my wife felt the need to break the news to me before she had the baby because she could no longer hide it 
 & amp nbsp well things happened i went back home without her knowing and removed my belongings from the house i bought to keep her from selling them once she realized what i was about to do and started divorce proceedings 
 & amp nbsp this is revenge # 1. i saw her <unk> not the baby 's father new guy entirely driving my car 
 so i enlisted the help of her aunt and uncle to get my car back 
 they pulled up behind him in a parking lot got out and talked to him normally at which time i <unk> up from the other side of the parking lot 
 her uncle asked to see the keys and upon receiving them began taking the car key off of the ring and waved me forward 
 & amp nbsp i walked up took the car key from him looked at the guy and said hi my name is frizzmaster and this is my car 
 i 'm taking it now '' 
 i waved him over to the sidewalk removed everything from the car that did n't have my name on it left the items with him then got in my car and drove off 
 & amp nbsp i found out later that day that he had packed everything and left her 
 apparently he had been living in my house eating my food sleeping in my bed and <unk> my <unk> 
 plus she had been using the money i sent her every month to pay for his court costs and child support costs 
 & amp nbsp well months went by our court date came up and my lawyer recommended that i file for sole use of the vehicle and the property since it was obvious that she had committed <unk> and did n't have a leg to stand on 
 we go to court she <unk> for the exact same and since she refused to release the results of a paternity test i get <unk> 
 the exact words used by the judge were i 'm sorry but without proof of paternity of the child i can not in good conscience approve either of these motions 
 & amp nbsp so we set a new date for a private hearing with the judge and we wait 
 nearly 3 months go by and the court date was finally near 
 i walked into the courthouse met up with my lawyer who had a demonic <unk> in his eye at the time and i was about to find out why went into the courtroom and waited 
 20 minutes later she walked in shot me a dirty look which i did my best to ignore and sat down 
 & amp nbsp the judge came in 5 minutes later the court was called to order and the divorce trial <unk> 
 here i found out just what had given my lawyer the <unk> in his eye earlier on 
 he proceeded to ask tc a series of questions including : & amp nbsp is my client the father of your child '' 
 & amp nbsp when was the child conceived '' 
 & amp nbsp where was my client during the time at which your child was conceived '' 
 & amp nbsp do you know who the father of your child is '' 
 & amp nbsp have you received child support from the father of your child '' 
 & amp nbsp basically he questioned her into a legal corner in which she either had to answer truthfully or lie and suffer the legal <unk> of perjury in the face of easily <unk> evidence 
 she answered truthfully lucky for her and the court case continued 
 she presented her argument littered with dirt she was trying to throw on me insults to my person questions about my sexual orientation and claims that i was having a relationship with her 18 year old cousin 
 & amp nbsp i falling back on my military training simply sat up straight folded my hands in front of me on the table and stared at a spot on the wall slightly above the <unk> left shoulder 
 i answered every question asked of me offered no personal opinions threw no dirt and refused to sink to her level and question her sexuality 
 subsequently she had a more and more confused look on her face as i <unk> from bad-mouthing her like she was doing me and the divorce trial went by rather fast 
 & amp nbsp at the conclusion of the trial the judge looked over the paperwork submitted one last time then looked to the both of us 
 are there any closing remarks or claims that need to be made '' 
 tc made one last parting swipe about me currently living with her aunt and uncle i had rented my own apartment months ago after finishing my military time and going back home and i merely shook my head and resumed staring at the wall 
 the judge took one last look over the papers set them down and spoke the greatest words i have ever heard in my life 
 & amp nbsp well looking over the evidence and <unk> presented there really is only one decision i can come to 
 mr. frizzmaster i am approving your motions for exclusive use of the vehicle and property upon <unk> evidence of <unk> 
 mrs. frizzmaster the only one of your motions i am granting today is your request for a <unk> order and that is more for mr. frizzmaster 's benefit than your own 
 you seemed very <unk> and willing to cause him legal damage that he was not due and your repeated attempts to <unk> me while i was reviewing the paperwork did not speak well of you 
 you no longer have a claim to either the property or the vehicle and will not contact mr. frizzmaster unless it is to have him clarify which items do not belong to you '' 
 & amp nbsp tc had the audacity to work up a <unk> and ask the judge <unk> where do i go 
 what do i do for a place to live '' 
 & amp nbsp the judge looked back at her and replied well mrs. frizzmaster you have 30 days to figure that out after which you will not set foot on that property again or else you will be held in contempt of court '' 
 **tl dr : horrible wife uses me for a meal ticket while she <unk> in a very active social life and i respond by giving her a legal <unk> 
 <unk> told you guys would get a kick out of this i had originally posted it to another topic but it was suggested i 'd share it with you 
 so here it is 
 gather round boy and girls because its time for the story of my cheating ex-wife and how i fucked her 
 now bare with me as this is a bit of a long one but fuck it 
 so i had a feeling she was cheating as she set off a lot of red flags 
 constantly laughing and smiling when texting saying it was just her mother when i asked 
 needing to stay late every night after work 
 when i 'd call in her co-workers said she left hours ago 
 when i asked her what was going on she 'd laugh it off and say it was just something they did to each other at the office all the time 
 the last straw to where i knew something was definitely up was when she went out to get milk '' at 11:30 at night and did n't come back till 2 in the morning 
 now if there is any words of wisdom i can pass on to others in all my years of experience its if you think your significant other is cheating hire a fucking private investigator 
 they 're goddamn good at what they do and they will get some evidence that really helps in the later divorce 
 fast track to her birthday several months down the road 
 now i know what you 're thinking why the hell did i wait months before i confronted her and did it really need to be on her birthday 
 the answer to the first question is i wanted as much evidence as possible to hand off to my lawyer as well as make arrangements to find a new place to live etc 
 answer to your second question is of course it had to be on her birthday 
 you see after asking her what she wanted to do on her birthday this year she was rather insisted on me going out of town with my friends as she just had to work anyways and did n't want to be reminded she was <unk> 
 so i know something is up and after finding a bottle of champagne and two glasses hidden in my closest something in my snaps 
 so i do what any sensible man would have done 
 i leave and go to my friends house pretending like i am going out of town 
 while there i call up her mother father sister and several of her friends 
 i tell them how i want to give her a big surprise by sneaking into her room with party <unk> <unk> and a big cake with candles 
 sounds fun right 
 well boy was it 
 its <unk> in the morning and i have everyone met just outside our apartment 
 we all pile in the elevator about 8 of us in total her mother holding the cake and me reminding everyone to be as quiet as they can be 
 my put my key in and unlock the door we all sneak in and make our way down the hall towards the bedroom 
 each hold a <unk> and mom holding the cake grinning from ear to ear 
 well as i throw open the door and we all yell surprise 
 but the surprise was on us and there was my wife bent over in doggy style position with her lover staring at us wide eyed mid <unk> 
 mom drops the cake sister screams father begins to shout 
 i pretend like i 'm horrified to which her friends try to push everyone out while yelling at her 
 wife excuse me ex-wife is sobbing and screaming how could i while the lover is desperately trying to put his pants on while running out of the place 
 needless to say it was one of the best birthday <unk> i have ever given 
 tl dr : gave ex-wife a kick ass birthday present 
 edit : broke up text so easier to read 
 edit 2 : posted a response to try and answer most your questions 
 let me know if there is anything else you wanted to <unk> was walking home after staying at work really late 
 walking through the bar scene i saw a cab and was so tired i decided to take it home the first time i 'd ever decided to do so 
 short aggressive ride where he 's tailgating honking swearing and <unk> as fuck despite it being a <unk> city 
 fare : $ <unk> 
 i give him $ 20 and ask for $ 12 back 
 cabbie gives me $ 10 from a giant wad of money and says sorry he does n't have any ones 
 ok dude thinks i 'm drunk because he picked me up outside of a bar and he thinks he deserves a better tip even though the ride was like 3 minutes 
 i say what do you mean you do n't have any ones you 're a cabbie and i just saw your giant wad of cash 
 he <unk> 
 i say no you 're driving me down the street to that pizza shop and we 're getting change 
 he says he wo n't 
 when i ask he refuses to give me his name and then gives me a <unk> get the fuck out of my cab '' looking like he 's going to punch me in the face 
 dude 's definitely a tough guy and pretty scary think short <unk> <unk> type with buzzed silver hair and a leather jacket so i leave but not before catching his cab number as he speeds off 
 ok it 's the principle of the matter 
 this guy 's doing this to drunk kids all night and probably making a lot of money by intimidating and <unk> these customers of a public service 
 fuck that 
 i call the cab company and get my full $ 10 back but it takes a bunch of harassment and several months to finally get it 
 fuck that 
 i call the cab company 's director who could n't care less and who flat out told me he believed the cabbie 's story over mine -- so not only is this shit happening but it 's being enabled and the complaints are n't being registered 
 fuck that especially 
 i tell him that if he does n't take any course of action whatsoever then i 'd be forced to take it up with the city 's transportation <unk> commission that <unk> all this stuff 
 he basically <unk> me to do so 
 ok so i enter into this ridiculously <unk> process where after reading up on the local laws i write a major complaint to the public commission and request they be fined under certain articles 
 a couple months later i get a response letter : cab company hires this sleazy ass lawyer who claims i 'm lying about everything and had all this malicious intent 
 claims i demanded ones and the cabbie did n't immediately <unk> them but then did seconds later and at that point i was so fuming mad that i wanted to exact revenge 
 calls my character and credibility into question completely 
 the letter was so amateur and there were so many transparent lies in it that it was both laughable and sad 
 so i go to my <unk> hearing '' which i took to mean was just like filling out paperwork or at most a private deposition or something 
 nope everyone 's there including the cabbie the <unk> secretary who sent my refund the cab company 's director the sleazy lawyer a court reporter and a judge 
 ridiculous cheap suits all around for the cab <unk> 
 the in-person <unk> of the lawyer did not <unk> -- think bad <unk> suit and pink tie <unk> back hair and pencil <unk> all resting on a sweaty and anxious fat man whose only apparent mode in trial is a combination of <unk> and <unk> 
 the cabbie 's giving me threatening looks during the whole thing and i 'm frankly a little scared he 's going to kick my ass afterward 
 as a bonus the judge is relatively young extremely polite thoughtful <unk> and patient 
 we give our stories 
 cabbie gives this <unk> terribly acted story of how i intimidated him into getting more ones become furious etc. but he ca n't even keep his facts together and keeps stumbling over his obviously rehearsed lines 
 sleazy lawyer tries to poke holes in my very simple and coherent story like it 's a <unk> boys novel it was dark you could n't have seen the <unk> of his money 
 it 's the <unk> fucking thing you 've ever seen 
 meanwhile i 'm trying to cross <unk> him while basically learning on the job how to be a <unk> lawyer at a shitty <unk> hearing and i even take a few <unk> at the cabbie for lying on the stand that were met with various objections 
 you could cut the tension between me and this cabbie with a knife and i made a lot of awkward mistakes because of that but overall it went pretty well 
 a funny mistake i remember is that the lawyer made some objection and i butted in and said that 's not even a good point '' and the judge cracked a smile in agreement and then told me me i could not be <unk> during the hearing 
 judge makes a ruling a few months later noting that the cabbie was clearly not <unk> and orders cab company to pay a $ 1500 civil penalty to the city for various infractions fraud not providing reasonable service '' and not identifying himself if i recall 
 sweet i think 
 but then months later lawyer issues an exception '' to this ruling which i did n't know could occur at around 9 pm the night it 's due 
 the exception brings up all these reasons that they should n't be fined e.g. there was <unk> for this fine before and also attacks my credibility once again regarding details of the story basically threatening to <unk> the ruling if i did n't <unk> i get notice of this filing via email and frantically write up an official response to exceptions '' which was required to address these issues and i submit it just under midnight 
 months later i think a total of <unk> years since the incident after several <unk> and <unk> judge <unk> the new material and rules that the $ 1500 fine stands 
 got any ones now asshole 
 tl dr : a cabbie would n't give me $ 2.00 in change so i went out of my way to make his cab company pay $ 1500 in civil fines 
 a couple years back i moved into this real exclusive apartment building in the miami beach area 
 i had no clue at the time my landlord was a <unk> dictator 
 after she took my deposit and we moved in the problems started 
 she had all sorts of crazy rules like shirts on for men at the pool no talking on cell phones in the hallway no overnight visitors and a whole list of shit she literally made up and applied whenever she wanted 
 i knew she was fucked off in the head and we generally tolerated it until one day she decided kids were not allowed to play in the courtyard 
 she started harassing my son on a regular basis telling him he was not allowed to play in the courtyard 
 however i had an ace up my <unk> 
 see i took a real estate course a few years back and i knew that discrimination against kids in any way shape or form was against federal law 
 revenge time 
 i told my son to ignore her and play as much as he wants as late as he wants granted he did his home work and his room was clean 
 one day she had enough and snapped even going as far as to scream at all the kids in the courtyard 
 she then knocked on every door who had a kid and informed them that playing in the courtyard by kids was not allowed 
 when she came to me i simply asked her to hand it to me in writing 
 she did 
 needless to say i hired an attorney and won 
 6 figure sum of which 30 % went to my sons trust in his name 
 the owner of the building stood by her side the entire time and so rightfully the suit cost him the building 
 he was forced to sell the building 
 the new owner hired me as the building manager 
 i was the resident manager for over two years 
 pro revenge 
 one of my ex girlfriends had a mother who was a high school teacher 
 she was the sweetest thing although was also a total pushover 
 for this story 's sake we 'll call her <unk> jones 
 when i 'd visit my ex this woman almost would n't leave me alone constantly can i get you something to eat 
 we had dinner earlier can i warm something up for you '' oh 
 i remember you like this hot sauce so i picked some up for you and it 's in the cupboard - here i 'll show you where so you can use it when you would like 
 total sweetheart 
 now i ca n't particularly vouch for how she was as a science teacher but i can only imagine she was probably overrun by shitty high school students who made her life hell 
 she probably had a hard time controlling the class in many situations 
 she just was n't all that <unk> 
 one day my ex calls me holy fuck you have to see this facebook group 
 and sends me the link 
 it 's titled mrs. jones is a cunt hahaha '' and has somewhere around 60 members all high school students talking shit about this poor women how they make her life hell and what they 've done / said to her etc 
 of course my ex is deeply <unk> because her mom is being <unk> online 
 at this same time my ex was completing her masters in university majoring in <unk> 
 her thesis was on bullying among teens 
 how <unk> 
 my ex insists she contact facebook to get it taken down 
 i told her no 
 let me see what i can do first 
 this caused a bit of a fight between her and i as i 'm one for teaching people a lesson while she wanted to sweep it under the rug so her mom would n't find out and it 'd just go away 
 further she did n't like eye for an eye '' <unk> 
 first i screenshot every conversation every comment every photo - just in case it went away somehow 
 i then wrote down every name made a nice little excel file with them all and began my <unk> 
 seeing as i knew where all these kids lived well the general region i began to search out phone numbers or the kids who were stupid enough to link their parents on their fb accounts 
 i found numbers or profiles for almost everyone - in many cases <unk> 
 next up i compiled all the screen grabs into a nice little 1 page webpage <unk> the worst comments 
 people 's full names as listed on fb essentially nothing that was n't already public information 
 i just <unk> it together into a cute little package 
 of course this included phone numbers as well 
 links to the fb group and the comments were below every photo 
 now the fun starts 
 i begin calling the home phones of these kids one by one 
 a typical conversation went as follows with little <unk> 
 hi is mr or <unk> <unk> available '' 
 hello '' hi there do you have a <unk> named <unk> yes who is this '' .. well i 'm a concerned internet user who 's come across some very disturbing comments your child posted about their high school teacher '' oh what '' 
 well if you go to <unk> i 've put them all together with some links for you '' * parent views page * <unk> uhh ... i 'm so sorry '' 
 well so you 're aware i 'm calling every parent with this same call 
 when i 'm done i 'm submitting this to both the school board head office and the administration of the school '' i 'm so sorry my child did this ... <unk> name of child - get in here <unk> thanks try and have a good evening '' i did n't get to find out the end details but her mother obviously ended up finding out about the group and the only info i got was that a good handful '' of the kids ended up getting suspended for between <unk> days depending on what they said 
 that was great and all but i 'm sure the wrath the parents laid out was far worse 
 i smirked to myself throughout the entire thing knowing i was probably ruining these kids spring breaks as it was the week before 
 **tl dr : ** - found a hate group on fb against my ex 's mom 
 got a ton of kids suspended and told all their parents which was really the most satisfying part of it <unk> ago i worked in a 24 hour call center 
 it was n't a bad job but i was always getting pushed to the night shift 
 on the other side of the call center was a claims department that only worked the <unk> <unk> shift and i jumped at the chance when a spot opened there 
 what a mistake 
 turned out the manager was this older female emotional <unk> ev who did nothing all day long but try to get you to tell her the worst things that happened to you in order to play dr. <unk> 
 she fed off <unk> these stories and the 3 other girls that worked there played into it 
 all day long there was nothing but drama and it was annoying but i dealt with it by ignoring it as best i could 
 but that was n't good enough for ev she wanted my stories wanted me to sit with them and hand <unk> and cry with them all day 
 i nearly bought stock in <unk> 
 i refused to play along drama <unk> me 
 so ev started this campaign of trying to get me to quit in order to hire someone more sympathetic to their little circle 
 suddenly all of my work was sub par i was always late or leaving early i was n't she was bad mouthing me to everyone she could think of 
 she also got her 3 little baby <unk> to harass me as well 
 nasty comments all day stuff getting spilled on my desk at my bathroom breaks my lunches going missing being found in the trash 
 i 'd finally had enough when she screwed me out of my raise on my <unk> review 
 i began secretly taking pictures of my desk before and after bathroom breaks <unk> out the less than professional e-mails i was getting from her kept an actual note on my desk that said we do n't want you here anymore '' 
 i took it all to my friend in hr along with my notice 
 i 'd found a better paying job anyway 
 hr friend said she would look into it and was sorry to see me go 
 on my last day ev just smirked at me as i walked out the door thinking that she 'd won 
 but her smile was n't nearly as big as mine when an it friend who worked there sent me a framed copy of ev 's terminated for cause '' letter a month later as my birthday present 
 i called my friend in hr asking how things were going 
 apparently ev tried the same drama routine on my replacement who did n't play along either and tried the same get them to quit '' tactics not realizing that hr had sent a plant as my replacement to verify my <unk> a bit of background this happened a few years back 
 smartphones we just starting to get cool and <unk> released the first <unk> phone the <unk> 
 i got one for myself and one for my wife for our anniversary it was her first <unk> and she loved the keyboard 
 we worked together at a clinical lab running people 's blood work and such this is actually how we came to know each other 
 i called in sick one day and my wife went to work without me 
 while i was crashed out on the couch feeling miserable i get a email from her phone 
 i had installed a app that reports home with all kinds of useful information when the sim card gets switched out 
 later when my wife got home she asked me if i had seen her phone thinking she had forgotten it at home when it was actually stolen from her purse at work 
 a few days later i am over my illness and back at work 
 knowing the phone was stolen most likely by a co-worker i decided to play dumb and talk very openly about how <unk> my wife is 
 saying things like this is the third phone she has lost '' i struck up a conversation with a girl that had been <unk> to have sticky fingers 
 other ladies at the lab suspected her of taking money from their purses but nothing could be proven 
 if had gotten so bad they had to install lockers forum everyone 
 so after a friendly conversation with her she offered to lend <unk> wife her old sidekick as she had recently gotten a new phone and was n't using it 
 i thanked her for her kindness and asked if we could talk more over text 
 she gave me her number and i checked the email the lost phone had sent days previous 
 of course the number associated with the sim card that was put into my wife 's phone matched the suspected co-worker 's 
 i continued to play dumb and let her kindly '' loan me the sidekick to replace my wife 's lost phone 
 she even offered to to sell it to me for cheap because we are friends '' 
 i let it sit for a few days and when she began asking for money for the phone she had given me i laid it all out over text message 
 i informed her that i had proof of her taking the phone and i would go to hr if she did not return it 
 of course she denied the theft at first but agreed to all my demands and eventually admitted to having the phone which she would return on condition of my silence 
 once my wife 's phone was back in my possession i presented all the <unk> and relevant emails to the lady in hr that i was most acquainted with 
 after getting my email <unk> up the events she asked me out to lunch so i could give her the whole story she was very excited to get to be a part of it 
 well a few weeks went by and nothing 
 then one morning actually more like noon as i work 2nd shift i wake to an interesting text 
 how could you do this to me 
 i got fired today because of you 
 i though we had worked out a deal '' 
 i smiled to myself got up and poured a cup of coffee 
 then i replied dance with the devil ... '' and blocked her number 
 this just happened 
 i am flying out of seattle on an early morning flight 
 there is a long line at the security check in area 
 so long that it is <unk> out of the designated area 
 the airport has provided a person with an end of the line '' sign to keep things from getting out of hand 
 so i get in line and 20 minutes go by 
 there are about 30 people behind me 
 suddenly out of nowhere there is a new person in front of me 
 now i am not sure about you but people who cut in line are second to serial <unk> for me 
 but maybe he is just mistaken so i tap him and tell him that the end of the line is way back there 
 this <unk> turns around and says to me no the new line started right here '' 
 what the fresh <unk> 
 the gall the brazen <unk> made my teeth <unk> 
 and i can tell that other people in line agree with me 
 but this is seattle so everyone just silently <unk> 
 meanwhile a tsa agent standing nearby witnessed this entire scene 
 he comes over to me and asks did that man cut '' 
 and i answered in the <unk> 
 to this he replied people like that never actually get ahead '' 
 little did i know his <unk> would <unk> itself soon thereafter 
 as we head to the <unk> belt where bags are <unk> this <unk> is still in front of me 
 he puts his bags on the belt but they do n't appear on the other end 
 finally it dawns on him all his bags have been commandeered for hand check '' 
 when the other passengers realize what happened there is audible celebration and jeering 
 somewhere out there there is a tsa agent who is judge jury and <unk> ago i was quite involved in an active online community of <unk> audio <unk> 
 people would occasionally put hardware and music up for sale on the message board we used 
 i 'd been looking for a specific piece of hardware for several years to no avail 
 it was extremely rare and had never been sold in the us so any examples would 've been <unk> from japan 
 one of these machines <unk> up for sale from someone in the community and i jumped on it 
 the guy offering it was n't new but was n't terribly active 
 somehow he 'd obtained pics that were n't on the 'net and/or not easily <unk> and <unk> up a fake japanese bill of sale 
 in hindsight he may have seen one for sale and stolen the images from that 
 regardless it all seemed legitimate enough to induce me to go through with the transaction 
 so paypal sent and he says it 'll ship in about a week 
 then the excuses begin 
 from he 's been busy to out of town to his <unk> shipped it but did n't send the tracking number to providing a fake tracking number 
 then he just quit responding to calls or emails 
 turns out the number he 'd given me was a forwarding service that he subsequently disconnected 
 he also disappeared from the forum 
 he had however used his real name and a real paypal account 
 i filed a paypal claim and of course they denied the claim on some <unk> 
 i 'm sure he was counting on this <unk> 
 this is where the revenge begins with an unintended bonus 
 all i wanted was to make sure the guy knew i 'd find him and get to him 
 i 'd called the police and reported matters but they could n't have given less of a damn 
 i decided to find him myself and found an old wedding announcement that 'd been posted on the 'net 
 i searched his wife 's name and found mention of her being out on leave to give birth to their first child on her work website 
 bingo 
 i had a small gift sent to her workplace with my name on it and called her work to say that i 'm an old friend and do n't have their contact info but wanted to wish them congratulations on the new child and that i 'd come see <unk> soon 
 i had <unk> of his wife saying how nice it is that someone sent a gift to her work etc and asking who i was 
 this apparently <unk> him because a cashier 's check showed up for the full amount 
 now what he had n't counted on and i did n't tell him was that i 'd filed a <unk> with american express after paypal denied the claim 
 my <unk> was this the amex investigation was <unk> and i had no idea if they 'd overturn the chargeback or not 
 i also had no idea if the cashier 's check was legit i 've heard of <unk> checks being returned up to 45 days later 
 so i truly did n't intend to profit off this 
 but i did 
 the amex chargeback was resolved in my favor which paypal <unk> back from his account shortly after the check was proven good 
 the kicker is the guy had the gall to email and threaten to try to have me charged with fraud for the chargeback when he 'd already sent the check 
 i simply responded and said hey 
 great to finally hear from you 
 glad you 're doing well how 's the baby 
 listen i 'm sure there 's just been a <unk> and i 'll be happy to pay everything just as soon i get the machine 
 i 'm sure you understand why i want to receive it before i pay at this point 
 of course if you do want to call the police you 're welcome to explain to them how you attempted to <unk> me by selling something you never <unk> in the first place 
 your call '' 
 never heard another word 
 i just hope his kid did n't have to go without diapers 
 tl dr : scammer temporarily got one over on me 
 i got that one back and ended up with a <unk> june 18th i was rear-ended by a gray dodge ram 
 i caught it on my dash cam and the man who hit me appears on the video twice 
 i got a picture of his insurance card damage done on both vehicles and license plates 
 he told me he would like to take care of this out of pocket as he did n't want his insurance rates to rise 
 i was okay with this i 've done it before with no issues 
 the next week i sent my truck in for an estimate 
 up until this we had been texting back and forth with no issues 
 i emailed him a copy of the estimate ... .and communication stopped 
 after hearing nothing from him for 3 days i called his insurance and filed a claim because i 'm not about to be jerked around 
 they came back in the same day telling me he had stopped paying back in march and so his insurance had been cancelled 
 they could not honor the claim 
 i was furious 
 i called and texted him relentlessly with no response 
 he was not going to pay and neither was his insurance despite his insurance card saying it expired july 1. i called my insurance and even though i was at no fault i have to pay $ 500 for repairs <unk> 
 i immediately went to the denver county court and filed paperwork for small claims then on to the sheriff 's department to serve him paperwork 
 the police were no help <unk> 
 the address he provided on his insurance was falsified and after telling the deputy 4 times to run his license plates he finally did 
 the same address was used to register his vehicle 
 there was no other way we could find him and so i was hopeless 
 i was going to pay for this dickhead 's damage and he was going to get away with it 
 until this morning i decided to do a few google searches for his name denver '' 
 a <unk> '' review popped up - a man with the same name had redone a patio and did a shitty job at it fortunately for me 
 i thought i 'd go ahead and call the company 
 i asked the receptionist for an <unk> to do some yard work and specifically requested name of dick face as i heard he was great at this stuff '' 
 she said he was great at landscaping so i asked he 's the one who drives the gray dodge truck right 
 she said yes '' 
 my heart stopped 
 that was all i needed 
 i called the deputy who was attempting to serve him and they 're currently on their way to serve the paperwork at his company 
 i fucking found you you piece of shit and i 'm going to make sure you pay me 
 the court date is august 12th 
 i 'll see you then 
 tl dr - got rear-ended the dick face was evading payment and i was better than the police at finding him 
 also - everyone should own a dash cam 
 seriously 
 dash cam footage for you all - there was a woman lets call her stacy 
 stacy owned a bar stacy has a great personality knows how to make drinks and successfully ran a bar 
 stacy is a young attractive ambitious woman 
 unfortunately for stacy after she built up her bar her husband emptied her bank account and ran off with all the money 
 this devastated stacy and she did n't have the <unk> power to move forward 
 so she sold the bar and started to live off the sale of the bar 
 stacy improved herself a lot stacy and i were friends not best friends but we knew each other 
 i knew stacy was starting to run out of money because she had mentioned this several times in facebook postings 
 well i 'm friends with quite a few business people and over the course of the last several months i recommended businesses to her to go apply for a job after the first recommendation she thanked me applied and got the job 
 she quit that job thats fine i recommend her another job some time later 
 she thanked me things did n't work out with that <unk> 
 life right 
 2 weeks ago a bar starts looking for a manager 
 their offer is really competitive high salary profit sharing etc 
 i tell stacy about this bar and this is copied and pasted only edited parts are the names club a is looking to hire a bar manager they want experience offer a good salary plus profit sharing go to their facebook page for more info '' thats it our messages for the past several months only had to about jobs all very short all very to the point 
 3 days later she responds i 'm sick and tired of you stalking me i 'm not into you stop messaging me '' i qualify this that she meant this for me and not someone else 
 she confirms its about me stalking her '' and how much of a pervert i am apparently 
 i stop responding 
 did i mention i 'm good friends with bar owner from club a 
 i asked him if stacy had applied he said she had and its between her and another guy 
 i said let me show you our fb conversation and maybe that will help you make up your mind '' so i hand him my phone after reading it he says i do n't think i want a woman like this working for me '' she did not get the job 
 she did not get the job 
 * fyi stacy has a boyfriend has had the same boyfriend for quite some time 
 he 's a good <unk> 'm a student at a local community college because the gen ed classes are much cheaper 
 i had a heart <unk> when i was younger but it was too late and now i suffer from chronic nerve pain that only gets worse the more active i am 
 so i have a handicap parking pass 
 one thing to note is that at this college with <unk> students there 's roughly 20-30 handicap spaces 
 on an average day there 's more unused faculty spaces than handicap spaces total 
 fast forward to my third semester 
 i had gotten into the habit of arriving 1 1/2 to 2 hours early to make sure i got a handicap spot because the next closest spaces are about 1200 feet away and you had to climb a hill to get to the main building 
 i 'd kill time by doing homework with my friends or playing d & amp d. first day of the semester i park and as i 'm getting my laptop out of my car i notice that another car had pulled up behind mine 
 the driver older woman <unk> <unk> to as eb short for english bitch asked if i was parking there i of course answered yes i have a placard '' 
 she <unk> and says out loud who 's is it 
 your <unk> '' 
 and drives away 
 at the time i did n't think too much of it 
 i 'm young and do n't have a wooden leg or anything so it 's happened before 
 the next day i arrive like i always do and notice that all the handicap spots are full and that the same car from yesterday is parked there 
 this time i recognize the woman in it 
 she 's an english professor 
 one of my friends has her for 18th century literature 
 i find this odd because the faculty spots are really close by 
 eb sees me and smirks 
 whatever i suck it up and park 
 that day me and my friends are playing d & amp d in a room we found 
 eb walks by and sees me and my friends and tells us that we 're not allowed to be there and we need to leave this second '' 
 now i 'm really pissed 
 she 's only doing this to be a bitch 
 we were n't hurting anyone and her class next door does n't even start for almost an hour 
 but she still sits in that room and reads a novel 
 she does the same thing every chance she gets for weeks 
 so i 've been thinking of a way to solve this problem for most of the semester 
 talking to the english department head my literature of science fiction teacher i find out that she does n't even have a placard 
 the one she hung from her mirror is her grown sons 
 now i know what to do 
 here 's what i did reserved the room she had her class in until 5 minutes before her class for dungeons and dragons club '' with a sign and everything 
 then i alerted campus police that several people were using other people handicap tags 
 for those unaware you get paperwork when you get one <unk> that it 's yours in my state using one that 's not yours is a <unk> offence and a automatic fine 
 so campus police start asking for peoples paperwork 
 that day starts like most others that semester get there she 's in a handicap spot 
 i go to play dungeons and dragons 
 but when she comes to kick us out of her room '' but she ca n't because i 've reserved it 
 after i inform her of this she storms off mumbling about seeing the dean 
 she comes back for her class but by that time i 'm on my way out 
 after my class i go out to the lot and notice that her car is missing 
 next day i arrive and <unk> car is n't in one of the spots 
 it was towed 
 best feeling of my life that day 
 my friend tells me later that she arrived to class 10 minutes late that day and covered in sweat 
 she <unk> there for the rest of the semester 
 never had a problem with her for the rest of that <unk> mom has been a nurse for almost a decade now 
 8 of those years she worked at the same hospital on one of the most busy floors to work on until she finally had enough of the <unk> management 
 before she left though she <unk> an amazing feat of revenge that got the hospital into a lot of trouble 
 as i said mom worked on what was probably the busiest floor in the whole hospital 
 this particular floor is severely <unk> and many times there were only three or four nurses working each one having to care for 10 or 11 patients each sometimes even more 
 lots of times it would be pretty much impossible to get everything done in a <unk> shift when you have to pass meds tend to and <unk> for that many patients 
 my mom is a great nurse 
 she is extremely smart a hard worker and she really does love her job 
 usually she would be the first nurse to get done with all of her work and then help other nurses with their workload so everyone could leave on time 
 her co-workers there loved her like no one 's business 
 this kind of work ethic landed her a position as a charge nurse 
 as a charge nurse it was her job to see to it that all or most of the paperwork is done properly and faxed that nurses were getting their <unk> in on time and passing meds when need be 
 it was her job to interact with the doctors and fill orders and direct in case of an emergency 
 now at this particular hospital there are a lot of residents who are fresh from <unk> and have very little experience in a real hospital setting 
 sometimes they would give orders that were unnecessary or not the best solution for the health of a patient 
 mom - being so respected - would often times coax the doctors into changing their orders to something more <unk> as she has a lot of real <unk> 
 but then some doctors would disagree and tell the nurses to go on ahead with his instruction 
 then when something goes wrong the blame would go on mom and there was really nothing she could do about it 
 she finally had enough when a doctor ordered a heart catheter on a patient who was extremely drunk and in no state of mind to make decisions for himself 
 my mom tried everything to get the doctor to not go through with it because the man really did n't need to have a heart catheter at all 
 this doctor was all the time ordering ridiculous <unk> for patients because that is how he makes his money 
 he <unk> this drunk man to sign the surgery papers and sends him to or where he was basically receiving an unauthorized surgery seeing as his decision making was impaired 
 after that my mom decided to start applying for jobs at other hospitals because she could n't stand to see any more patients being abused and <unk> by the place that is supposed to have their health in best interest 
 when she finally landed another <unk> position she gave her notice and worked to the end of her term 
 after she <unk> her last check they tried to tell her she was <unk> and she would have to pay back some of the money 
 obviously she did n't and was appalled at the way they were treating her after 8+ years of loyalty to this hospital 
 so she started plotting her revenge 
 before quitting she contacted jcaho joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and told them about the unauthorized surgery 
 this is a big no-no 
 it is something that can make a hospital lose their accreditation and be closed down permanently 
 she gave them the name of the patient the file number the case number the name of the doctor and the name of all other parties involved in the surgery 
 she was very thorough 
 the day after she quit a close friend of hers that worked the same floor said that a jcaho rep came and did some investigating almost entirely unannounced they do warn the hospital before they come but never give them enough of a notice to change anything beforehand 
 about a week after their initial investigation one or two people had gone and interviewed staff and look at medical records they came back again 
 this time they came with a lot of people 
 they pulled every single file to review and see if any other sketchy practices had been <unk> under the radar 
 for every breach of hipaa and osha <unk> they were fined thousands of dollars 
 the doctor and all staff involved in the <unk> catheter incident were fired and the doctor lost his license and can never get it back 
 they threatened to close the hospital if the fines were n't paid which added up to hundreds of thousands of dollars 
 of course the family of the man found out about the surgery and sued the hospital spoiler : he won and had to pay him off too 
 to this day jcaho visits the hospital frequently to make sure no more unethical practices happen again 
 do n't treat your nurses like shit and do n't treat your patients like shit or it will come back and bite you in the ass

 every season he has something else going on 
 the website has a page for each of the services and <unk> and gets him a bunch of traffic during those <unk> a man a few years ago 
 we became good friends 
 after awhile i got a promotion at work and had to move 
 i was looking for someone to take over my lease he without me asking said i 'll take over your lease what are the details '' i explained the terms of the lease asked him if he was cool with that 
 he said yea '' so we agreed he 'd pay me the deposit we 'd sign over the lease to him when he moves out landlord will give him my deposit 
 boom everything is cool 
 day to sign the lease comes up he 's a no show 
 he 's dropped off the face of the earth 
 he blocked my number and stopped talking to me 
 this end up costing me $ 800 i had to pay a month worth of rent as i looked for someone to take over the lease it really pissed me off cause you see he approached me saying he wanted to do it 
 he committed to me that he would deliver and then he drops off the face of the earth 
 he never came to me and gave me an apology or an excuse 
 i get it shit happens 
 about a month after this all went down i get a random message basically saying do you know where justin is '' 
 i go no who is this '' responds this this is <unk> girlfriend i 'm looking for him '' we get to talking turns out this girl loaned justin $ 5,000 and he just straight up told her he ca n't pay her back and would n't speak to her in person 
 i shared my story on how he fucked me over too right around the same time 
 i suggested we meet up 
 she agreed and a few nights later we met up for some dinner and drinks 
 now justin has given this girl the raw end of the deal and she was sick of it 
 he had sold some of her jewelry cheated on her not paid back the loan and all around was a real dick to her 
 she then said i just wish i could get back at him for some of the shit he did '' i jokingly said you could fuck me i was one of his friends '' she then looked at me and said think that 'd piss him off '' 
 i reminded her he was always the jealous type 
 he was and that her sleeping with one of his friends would piss him off to no end 
 so we ended up going to a hotel and fucked like dogs all in the spite of the justin 
 afterwards she snapped a picture of us together in the hotel each one of us holding our underwear with the message just had the best sex ever '' he was super pissed he responded immediately 
 she pushed him telling him how my dick was bigger then his how i was a way better lay and so on and so on 
 and ladies and gentlemen that is how i met my now <unk> and future wife 
 thanks justin 
 i lost $ 800 but i got an awesome woman in <unk> when i was in college i used to wait tables to pay the bills 
 i worked at a high-end restaurant in the downtown '' area serving both lunch and dinner but dinner service was where the bulk of my income came from 
 because most of the hostesses for were in high school the managers asked servers to volunteer to host for lunch service which i volunteered to do one day a week 
 the shift was always shown on our server schedule 
 one day i came home in the afternoon and had messages on my answering machine from my frantic 19 year old manager asking where i was and saying i was scheduled to hostess 
 i was surprised because i swore i was n't scheduled and since it was after lunch service i went in for my dinner shift as scheduled 
 when i got there i confirmed i didn’t have a shift marked on the regular schedule but someone pointed out since it was summer and high school was out the manager created a separate schedule for hostesses and i was scheduled there 
 i talked to a manager and explained what happened but they sent me home from working my dinner shift anyhow 
 angry that i was punished something i didn’t feel was my fault and because i was actually volunteering to help out i took a note to the office the next day saying that since i was not hired to work as a hostess and it was now <unk> my income as a server i did not agree to work anymore hostess shifts 
 well turned out they had me scheduled on a second hostess shift that week which again i did not know about and didn’t show up for 
 sure enough they fired me and it was only a couple weeks before i was about to leave on a long summer trip overseas 
 since i had heard from people in town that the tip out policy for the restaurant requiring us to tip 5 % of our tips to the kitchen staff was illegal i did some research found out it was and made a trip to the labor board with a copy of an employee hand book and filed a complaint 
 took them awhile to go in and investigate but about a year later i got a check for $ 2k they had to reimburse me for those <unk> and found out it cost them a total of over $ 500k to reimburse all the restaurants employees they have to go back 2 years from the time they go in and investigate and paid a ton of fines 
 the bonus on top of it all was it turned out they had underage <unk> washing dishes when the <unk> went in so they got hit with additional violations for that 
 tl dr – <unk> fired so i filed a complaint with the labor board over violations that cost the owner over half a million dollars 
 edit : since a few people have asked about what state this occurred in etc i found the following fact sheet from the u.s. department of labor 
 therefore it appears this is applicable in all states 
 & gt tip pool : the requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not <unk> a valid tip <unk> or sharing arrangement among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips such as <unk> waitresses <unk> counter personnel who serve customers <unk> and service <unk> 
 a valid tip pool may not include employees who do not customarily and regularly received tips such as dishwashers cooks <unk> and janitors 
 throwaway because i do n't know if i could get in trouble for posting this or not 
 so the other day my strict manager was in a particularly good mood and told us this story and i thought it belonged here 
 a week or two ago it was dinner time on a friday so like plenty of other restaurants we were really busy with a long wait 
 a former employee from a different location comes in to apply for a job 
 because of how busy we are the manager asks the cashier for basic information and her resume so he can look her up in our system 
 he finds out that she ca n't be rehired per company policy so he has the cashier tell her that the restaurant is too busy for a manager to interview her 
 despite not getting an interview the girl and her friend decide to eat dinner 
 and not pay 
 my manager looks over the tapes and sees the girl applying for the job walk around through the store section of our restaurant go to the bathroom and leave 
 a few minutes later her friend does the same thing 
 luckily he has all of her personal information on the resume she left as well as information on her car from security cameras 
 what does my manager do 
 he calls her back up and apologizes for being so busy maybe she could come back in for an interview with him 
 she wants to know when so my boss lies and says that he 's leaving on vacation for a few weeks and it would be best if she came back in as soon as possible 
 an hour later he sees her car pull into the parking lot and calls the police 
 he sits down with her and <unk> an interview like any other 
 he excuses himself to go get some <unk> paperwork '' and comes back with the receipts and confronts her about not paying 
 she immediately starts freaking out saying her friend told her she would pay for her meal and talking about how her friend was always stealing from her and she should n't trust her friend anymore 
 she offers to pay for her meal but says she wo n't pay for her friend 's 
 my manager tells her that she 'll pay for both or he 'll bring in the police that he 's already called 
 she pays for both meals and leaves a nice $ <unk> $ 6 tip 
 then she asked my manager wait you did n't just bring me in here to have me pay did you '' 
 my manager tells her of course not but that she should come in tomorrow and ask for <unk> our general manager so she can interview her 
 sure enough she comes in the next day and asks for our gm 
 <unk> tells her that not only will she never work at one of our restaurants again but she is not welcomed back at our location 
 a lot to go through for a dine and dash but still amusing if you ask <unk> stumbled over this subreddit and immediately knew that i had a story to tell that fits perfectly in here 
 & amp nbsp this was about a year ago 
 i had just moved into my new flat because the previous one was quite uncomfortable as the owner and other <unk> were generally dicks 
 lots of <unk> with them and lots of <unk> learned on how not to deal with people 
 your usual college experience stuff you know 
 & amp nbsp now i had a job and money : time to live on my own 
 & amp nbsp i move in and all is fine for a month 
 but i am exposed to loud gaming noises 
 i 'm a <unk> myself so naturally i am not too annoyed about this 
 but these game noises would normally not stop until <unk> 
 which is kinda shitty for my <unk> and the enjoyment of weekends 
 trying to do the civil thing i ask the neighbour to turn it down 
 turns out my neighbour is from new zealand and doesnt speak german 
 hint this is all taking place in germany my english is good enough to have some chitchat and i try to build a friendly bond '' by <unk> that he is either <unk> or <unk> 
 he 's <unk> by my english and confirms to be a <unk> 
 he concludes with saying that it is no problem to game quietly says he can do that definitely 
 & amp nbsp however : no <unk> change in volume 
 rinse and repeat the same over the following week with very short convos about the noise and nothing else 
 i get a bit more annoyed on a thursday at <unk> explaining that i have a job in the morning and i 'd like to be on time and well rested etc 
 to that i simply get a fuck off you 've been annoying me already enough 
 suck it up like a man '' and he closes the door 
 further attempts from me to just figure out wtf just happened by ringing the doorbell and knocking are ignored 
 his dog goes apeshit at the same time 
 & amp nbsp i am short tempered 
 & amp nbsp fuck this guy 
 i take some <unk> and tape his doorbell button so it constantly rings 
 got ta be efficient about this it 's germany it 's the law to be efficient 
 also got ta be smart about this 
 i pull my <unk> for the entrance hall that supply the light and doorbell 
 all in preparation of that piece of tape <unk> to my doorbell 
 & amp nbsp i try to go to sleep <unk> that the idiot is trying to ignore the doorbell for a good 5 minutes before i hear it stop 
 i guess he figured out it was just a tape 
 the next morning i see the tape on my doorbell 
 ca n't get me with my own weapons sucker ... & amp nbsp fast <unk> two days 
 gaming noises at <unk> same annoying volume 
 i am pissed off and knock on his door 
 no answer 
 by now the neighbour on the other side has come to the hallway and asks what is going on 
 i tell him about the noise issues and he just confirms that its quite normal for that guy but he ca n't do anything permanent about it 
 but he offers to call the cops as he has done that before many times 
 & amp nbsp i go back inside and notice the gaming volume has massively increased 
 what a spiteful sucker ... i can also make out that he 's gaming on xbox from the notification sounds that pop up every now and then 
 <unk> that i have a potential ally calling the cops who is already openly in hostility with this guy i wait for the cops to arrive and find his extremely loud gaming 
 & amp nbsp <unk> basically tell both of them to respect the rules of being quiet after 10 and to not be dicks about it 
 i fight the urge to enter the hallway and openly reveal myself to the asshat neighbour as being involved with the cop call 
 a lesson i learned from previous <unk> : fuck em without <unk> yourself as the origin of the trouble 
 it makes you less of a target and <unk> that you have a <unk> for possibly <unk> stuff 
 i heed this advice very closely 
 & amp nbsp and that would 've been the end of it if my beloved fucktard neighbour had stuck to the copper 's advice 
 basically the second the <unk> left in their car i am back to experiencing him losing at whatever shitty game he plays 
 & amp nbsp i <unk> complain to my flat owner via phone about how to solve this and that i am super unhappy with the noise and i ask what can be done about it 
 my landlord tells me that the flat next door is not owned by her but by someone else named fritz name obviously changed for this story and that therefore she can not do much about it other than complaining to them 
 after some digging by checking door labels and <unk> and basement <unk> i find out that the <unk> dickbag neighbour is living with the daughter of the flat owner lady fritz 
 & amp nbsp shit 
 & amp nbsp i know that the <unk> angle is now impossible or very unlikely ... however i have never seen that girl walk in or out of his apartment or seen her any other way 
 also he plays loud console games until 2am 
 i 'd like to meet a woman that would live with me and let me do that 
 i doubt they exist 
 from this i assume the girl isnt even living with him or not anymore or something shady is going on ... & amp nbsp i had many nights awake that i could have called the cops filed complains tried to get restraining orders and whatnot 
 but i literally have no time or knowledge about this stuff and i asked my landlord to pursue the legal route for me 
 which was not really <unk> anything 
 i doubt she did anything 
 & amp nbsp meanwhile i spent the occasional <unk> night planning and plotting 
 this guy will go down 
 & amp nbsp i take the latest <unk> informing us about <unk> cleaning and lift <unk> '' and create a <unk> 
 i work with photoshop and <unk> a lot so this was easy 
 purposefully and to stay on the legal side of this i <unk> a <unk> logo different <unk> and <unk> but same font and <unk> for the body 
 & amp nbsp half an our later a super nice letter is made <unk> how this building we are living in has decided collectively that garbage separation is a scam and therefore no longer a thing that applies to us 
 in germany <unk> by law a requirement to save the environment : so all your <unk> waste can not go into the same bin as your plastic or paper shit goes 
 we separate <unk> <unk> and paper 
 heck even bottles into white brown and green glass 
 & amp nbsp queue evil grin 
 & amp nbsp i put this notice folded correctly in the retarded way our building association <unk> their stuff and put it into his mailbox 
 & amp nbsp he always keeps his <unk> in front of the door on the hallway until he feels like carrying them down to the <unk> two or three days <unk> 
 which annoyed me as well 
 it used to be two bags : the classic yellow bag '' which we use for plastic trash and a regular bag for food waste and similar stuff 
 & amp nbsp now it is just the yellow bag with all shit in it 
 i have my confirmation 
 that dickbag is an idiot who ca n't tell legit from fake 
 plus he 's in for a fine and citation from the garbage service as they literally do n't take his yellow bags if they can see stuff that doesnt belong in there 
 the yellow bags are <unk> google <unk> sack '' & amp nbsp the citation is just a nice side effect : i have my knowledge now that this guy is not mentally alert enough to properly <unk> stuff 
 a very bad habit but very important to know 
 & amp nbsp got him fined : ☑ & amp nbsp by now in mid summer this guy is smoking a <unk> gaming less 
 and if i have my windows open all his shit smoke enters my flat and upsets me even more 
 boy this guy is trying hard to annoy me 
 as soon as i try to communicate with him all i get is rude <unk> and insults in his accent that i find kinda hilarious 
 definitely not a pretty reply to hi there ... '' 
 i close this <unk> conversation by thinking to myself ok enjoy your cancer ... '' 
 i think since then he trys to smoke more often out the window just to piss me off 
 & amp nbsp fine by me 
 i fire up <unk> and set up a new letterhead and logo 
 this time from a well known tobacco company 
 i write up a letter directly addressed at him 
 contents are some copy pasted marketing bs from their website which then i conclude with a statement of how the company knows that he is a person making good <unk> and knows what is good 
 to thank him for this the company has included two cigars as <unk> gift 
 i fix it up in an envelope and use my company 's <unk> <unk> to make it into these typical <unk> 
 i slap an address onto it send it through proper mail for that extra bit of authentic mail stamp and handling 
 cost me probably all in all 10€ 
 & amp nbsp yes i am trying to <unk> this guy 
 yes i am literally trying to give this guy cancer 
 i have a short temper 
 & amp nbsp i admit it was n't too successful 
 i hoped he 'd switch over to 100 % smoking cigars but i could n't <unk> the cigars with crack or some other drug to make him addicted 
 but still i know that he was buying cigars every now and then and smoking them 
 & amp nbsp as for me 
 i simply closed my window and that was the end of the problem for me 
 & amp nbsp <unk> his cancer : ☑ & amp nbsp back to <unk> the <unk> problem : oh boy ... the internet is lovely 
 i know quite a lot of detail about this guy and his girl thanks to linked in instagram and facebook 
 that shit should be illegal seeing how easy it is find out stuff about people 
 its scary 
 i locked my stuff away super quick after this 
 finding out someones email via linkedin <unk> also dangerously easy 
 & amp nbsp now i find out how this guy can live there and play until 2am 
 the girlfriend is not living in germany but studying in <unk> 
 i assume they visit each other occasionally or its really just a <unk> arrangement but fb tells me they are an item so i rule out the <unk> theory and <unk> with that any hope that this problem will resolve itself once she comes back 
 & amp nbsp my landlord has given me the phone number of the fritz flat owner who i should call if the problem gets out of hand 
 i did that few times and it worked barely two times 
 & amp nbsp bless skype <unk> service 
 i quickly make a new skype account get <unk> for skype credit and i get ready to text that lady from an <unk> 
 i dont trust the <unk> websites i send that poor old lady a text in german saying that i suspect asshat guy is having an affair with someone but that i am unable to reach said daughter directly 
 <unk> with generic german girls name 
 & amp nbsp the back and forth annoying continues for a while until the end of september when the daughter returns to live in the apartment 
 lo and behold 
 the gaming at 2am stopped 
 i am almost happy had i not set my sights to destroying this asshat idiot 
 i ca n't just leave stuff unfinished ... & amp nbsp that skype acc with credit comes in handy again 
 i start calling the number that this loud flat had provided in the general neighbour contacts sheet 
 the one number was a landline number the other was a mobile number so i had a <unk> chance of getting the guy or the girl when i call either line at first worried about this i decided that was actually <unk> 
 & amp nbsp so i start calling their landline seriously who the eff has a landline anymore 
 at random times of day one or twice a week 
 always when i know the fritz daughter is home 
 when she picks up and says her name i just hang up super quick 
 right after that i call the mobile number which to my luck turned out was the guy 's mobile number 
 he picks up and i give him with <unk> voice and heavy german accent that i assume was good enough to <unk> me some random trash talk about cigars pretending i was a sales rep from the tobacco company 
 i keep the convo short and try to ask questions that have him say answers like yes '' sure '' and do n't worry '' 
 then i try to go for the kicker : i ask him if he would like to be invited for a tobacco trade festival the next weekend 
 it would be out about <unk> of drive of town beginning on a saturday at <unk> and running for the entire sunday 
 & amp nbsp i was trying to get him to yell out loud next weekend sure '' 
 or i 'll be there 
 but he did n't 
 i spun along some crap details to give him more security and a sense of <unk> of this 
 he reassured me he would be there 
 i asked if xyz was the name that should be on his <unk> for one 
 sadly due to high <unk> he could n't bring a <unk> 
 it 's ok she doesnt smoke anyway 
 after saying thanks we hang up 
 & amp nbsp i wish i could 've been a mouse in the wall <unk> to what fritzdaughter was asking and saying 
 & amp nbsp now here i lose my firm <unk> of the situation a bit as i could n't get 100 % exact confirmation that he actually left on saturday midday for the distant city 
 but it would n't matter really 
 he just needed to come back super late or the next day with an excuse that the entire thing did n't exist and was <unk> 
 which i hope the fritzdaughter figured out as well 
 & amp nbsp i bought some new boxers and wrote in my best <unk> a note : you forgot that asshole 
 also why are you still living with that bitch 
 it 's over '' 
 i put both the boxers and the note into their mailbox and hoped that fritzdaughter would be the one opening it 
 now there is a problem 
 the post doesnt deliver on saturdays or sundays here in germany 
 so i had to get her to check her postbox 
 & amp nbsp i walked over to the <unk> and rang the bell 
 fritzdaughter opened and i ask her whether she had also gotten the letter about some excuse for misinformation about garbage separation some months ago and that there is a way to claim damages because of fines that <unk> due to misinformation 
 i could n't quite figure out who to call about this and was wondering if she had already done this mentioning that i was relieved that this letter was handed to me today in person 
 she told me she did n't receive one 
 ah possibly they will mail it to you then '' and i said goodbye and left 
 & amp nbsp i went into my flat and waited for the fruit of my <unk> labour to be ready 
 i did n't confirm that she checked the postbox but i know she did sometime 
 because the asshat guy came back at around <unk> how do i know 
 the walls a thin and a pissed of girlfriend can be super loud and very <unk> in her language 
 i could n't make out too many details but i 'd like to think that my plan worked out perfectly well as she kicked him out right there and then which again could be heard very loudly from the hallway 
 & amp nbsp got him kicked out : ☑ got his gf to dump him : ☑ & amp nbsp he left with his dog 
 which is a shame as it was <unk> my goal to make him lose ownership of the dog as well 
 but i guess i ca n't be too cruel 
 if i was n't already seeing someone else i 'd probably would 've started courting fritzdaughter as a cherry on top 
 but <unk> ... & amp nbsp tl dr neighbour is <unk> make him get fined make his gf dump him get him kicked out and sped up his cancer 
 <unk> & amp nbsp & amp nbsp edit : reddit formatting 
 it is hard 
 this is as good as it gets 
 <unk> : thanks for reddit gold 
 : o i do n't know what do with this 
 does anyone want it my grandmother got married in <unk> to a young man in the military 
 for a wedding present their parents bought them a house in a nice suburb 
 white picket fence whole 9 yards 
 not long after they moved in the next door neighbor planted a mullberry tree on the side of his property near my <unk> 's driveway 
 nothing seemed amiss but if you know mullberry trees you know that shit is about to get real 
 about 15 years later the mullberry tree was obnoxious 
 the birds would come and eat the <unk> and any car parked in the driveway would get shit on and it would stain the cars and ruin paint jobs 
 my grandmother upon realizing the culprit <unk> a nice apple pie walked next door and asked the neighbor if he 'd mind <unk> back the branches of the tree that hung over her driveway 
 he told her not to worry he 'd get to it soon 
 three days later my grandmother opened her door to find a <unk> pie in the plate <unk> with ants and a note that said i changed my mind '' 
 my grandmother threw out the pie cursing up a storm and swearing up and down she 'd get him to trim that tree or get him back 
 city ordinance said she could not trim the tree as the roots were on his property so the whole tree was his property 
 as the years went by my grandmother repeatedly asked him ever so nicely to trim it back 
 his responses were always along the lines of no '' and fuck off '' 
 finally in the <unk> my grandmother retired and received a large bonus from her employer for her 35 years of work 
 she took the money and bought the empty lot on the other side of the neighbor then went to a <unk> and bought 16 mullberry trees planting them along her property line on both sides of his property 
 about 3 years ago he became angry at the damage they were doing to his cars and cut them all back without permission 
 my grandmother took him to court and he was forced to reimburse her for the trees at a <unk> because they 'd had 10 years to <unk> certain <unk> <unk> brought this memory to mind 
 this happened a good ten years ago or so 
 my dad has a group friends from highschool who all own <unk> and go <unk> together several times a year 
 they are all old highschool friends from a suburban type town plus a couple of family members who 've since joined the band <unk> '' 
 one of those guys let 's call him randy got some awesome prorevenge 
 now randy is a nice guy through and through 
 he 's the kind of guy you feel you could trust with just about everything and sometimes he gets stepped on because of this but he keeps on going because he 's far above bitter resentment 
 randy also has a nice red jeep that looks like such if memory serves he takes on the trails with my dad and the rest of his friends 
 it looks like your standard jeep but he 's put a lot of money into it fixing it up and modifying it to run the trails they like to go on 
 turns out someone else decided he had a nice jeep too 
 randy wakes up one morning to find his jeep gone 
 it does n't take long to realize it 's been stolen 
 they rally a search call the police nothing for about a week until they finally find his jeep flipped over and stripped bare in the middle of an <unk> 
 several thousands of dollars and days worth of time - poof - gone to one jerk 
 but whatever randy <unk> <unk> it back and takes his sweet time trying to restore his toy 
 several months go by 
 the police have no luck and we 're all convinced the guy got away scot-free 
 i mean most of the parts were standard stuff 
 they probably got separated and sold off on ebay 
 heck he could be selling them a next swap meet and there 'd be nothing we could do about it because how could we prove those parts were randy 's 
 it 's a done deal we realize 
 nothing to do 
 we kind of even forget about it all for the most part 
 then one day my cousin in the next town over gets a knock on his door 
 now my cousin is basically mid age between me and my dad 
 he has his own jeep goes on trips with everyone else and so he thought nothing of it when some random guy knocks on his door telling him hey 
 i saw you had a jeep 
 i happen to have some jeep parts for sell 
 are you interested '' 
 of course '' 
 my cousin says without thinking 
 what do you have '' 
 a whole lot come on over '' 
 so my cousin goes to this guy 's house and sees an array of jeep parts including a <unk> shell 
 he thinks to himself and says you know i have all of this but i have a buddy who 's looking for a lot of this stuff 
 here 's his number '' 
 the guy also not thinking says yeah 
 let me do that '' 
 so randy gets a call from a guy trying to sell jeep parts in the next town over 
 why not take a look 
 he thinks 
 he calls my dad and they head over in my dad 's truck prepared to buy some parts 
 they start talking with guy looking at the stuff realizing he has a lot of the same things randy is looking for 
 everyone gets happy seeing that a transaction is about to occur 
 then randy and my dad start noticing things 
 that part there 
 look at that weld 
 that 's not standard 
 that looks an awful lot like the weld you and i did 
 oh look at that 
 did n't we repair that part just like that too 
 wait a second 
 it dawns on randy that he is looking at his own shit and the guy trying to sell him this stuff is the thief 
 his mind <unk> red his eyes go wide but he 's not prone to violence and thinks ahead 
 he wants prorevenge 
 he realizes instantly he ca n't prove any of this stuff is his 
 how could he prove that weld was done by him 
 you ca n't 
 he 's only got one saving grace : the <unk> shell still has the original lock 
 and back home randy has the original key hanging up in his garage 
 you know i 'd really like to buy this stuff '' he says to the thief 
 let me go get my trailer cause the truck we brought is n't big enough '' 
 absolutely '' 
 says thief 
 today 's his lucky day he 's sure of it 
 so randy goes home calls the cops grabs his old key and heads back to thief 's house 
 with cops standing by as witnesses he walks up to the <unk> top and opens it 
 randy gets every single part he lost back and thief goes to jail 
 always keep the <unk> am a season ticket holder for my local <unk> team 
 currently in my second year but this happened last year 
 one lazy saturday afternoon i was planning to use the tickets i had for the day 
 i have 2. my friend had to bail last second so since i 'm not that far away from the park i decided to just go ahead and go by myself 
 it was too beautiful a day not to 
 after getting a beer and some <unk> i head down to my section 
 i see the majority of the row is filled including my seats 
 this is definitely not the first time this has happened and usually if its kids i just sit somewhere else near by and enjoy the game anyway 
 last year the team was n't doing very well and there more than a few open seats 
 so i end up sitting in the same row about 5 seats away 
 well about 10 minutes later the rest of the group came back from wherever they were and i was sitting in their seats 
 one of them says hey can you move we were sitting here '' 
 before i could respond or even just politely move their friends who were sitting in my seats <unk> in and say yeah we do n't who that is he 's just been sitting there like a creep since you guys left '' i get up and say to the kid who asked me to move oh i 'm sorry '' and walk over to the one who called me a creep and said get out of my seat '' 
 i showed him the ticket and with little protest he moved to the end 
 then i looked at his friend and said you too 
 these are both mine '' 
 for two <unk> we sat their awkwardly 
 best part was when i ordered a hot dog and another beer so they would have to pass it down to me 
 eventually they moved but i felt pretty good about how i handled the situation 
 this is not my story it belongs <unk> he posted it in an ask reddit thread 
 was working as an expat oil company senior staff geologist and de <unk> exploration manager but without the increase in pay nor authority just increased stress levels in the middle east for a southern european construction company 's oil and gas <unk> 
 the general manager was a complete <unk> 
 full of himself because he worked for one major oil company his whole <unk> career as an engineer so obviously he knows everything about geology <unk> <unk> etc 
 he did n't and does n't 
 his management style '' if one could grace his screaming and <unk> fuming as a <unk> could be described <unk> as <unk> micromanagement or <unk> by objection 
 would berate and <unk> the entire staff in meetings with partners which made everyone terribly uncomfortable to see such a lack of decorum and <unk> scream so the whole office could hear over mundane <unk> such as lack of coffee pods in the kitchen or why <unk> meters of pipe had never <unk> even though the unpaid invoice still <unk> on his desk 
 in a multicultural office he would rant and rail at top volume about useless fucking <unk> '' fucking <unk> and entitled expats '' and goddamn fucking <unk> those engineers and others from the <unk> region '' 
 called the firm the worst fucking oil company in the middle east '' at least here we agreed 
 not only a racist but a sexist <unk> general <unk> and a complete and total waste of carbon 
 he got in my <unk> locker one day after a well was drilled but yet to be tested or completed based on my prospect and recommendation looked somewhat <unk> on the logs 
 truth is the well came in for over 8,000 <unk> and it was the <unk> and <unk> from whom he always took <unk> <unk> that had fucked over the logs and he absolutely refused my insistence to <unk> the pay <unk> 
 i was called just about every nasty name in the oil patch handbook right down to the part where he told me my <unk> <unk> were a bunch of <unk> idiots for granting me my three <unk> geology degrees 
 after 26 years in the patch i decided that no job was worth this and laid plans for a quick early and entirely unannounced departure 
 i quietly related the fact that i was doing a runner '' to some of my other expat <unk> over drinks one thursday evening and was greeted with the revelation that several read : most of the other expats there were 1. thinking the same thing and 2. if i left they were gone as well 
 we carefully laid our plans 
 the company <unk> housing <unk> paid a ridiculously low monthly fee so we had to live in cheap-ass housing or sucked it up with our families and <unk> up additional funds to live in decent <unk> so we all gave <unk> notice to our respective landlords about our <unk> departure and asked they keep it on the <unk> 
 since they were paid by check 12 per year and were already <unk> they were both delighted that they had already been paid once and that they could rent out our abodes after we left for essentially double rent 
 cancellation of internet water and power were token a quick email print the automated response and carry it with you if the border guards gave us any shit when we <unk> off 
 since we were all <unk> european canadian or american we decided to book a block of business class tickets as was our contractual due to london on the same british <unk> flight 
 in fact with families and all we booked the entire business class section 
 we all had been <unk> for years and years so arranging packing and shipping or storage of our belongings was a snap 
 we were all members of the <unk> every 18 months to follow the money crowd so this was the easiest part of our master plan 
 no one leaked a word of all this but some of the locals in the company somehow <unk> the change in the decorum of the company 's daily activities when one really does n't give a shit the stress levels magically <unk> down to near zero and <unk> aloud what was going on 
 we confided in a few of them these were not just colleagues but personal friends in many cases with the proviso that they would tell no one under the pain of <unk> sandwiches they were all muslims and they thought the threat hilarious 
 like i said many were and are still close personal friends 
 the weeks dragged on and school was about to let out for the summer when most expats <unk> off for <unk> months to escape the stupidly hot and humid middle eastern <unk> season so the usual requests for contractual time off were made and all <unk> <unk> by herr mr. dickhead general manager and life proceeded on its merry way 
 finally <unk> friday arrived weekends being <unk> at this time in this country 
 we contracted a local carrier and had a bus rented to pick up everyone and take us all to the airport 
 luggage tagged and <unk> off to the bowels of <unk> <unk> <unk> inner <unk> through check-in <unk> and passport control without so much as a sideways glance 
 we all invaded the english pub after hitting duty free one last time we toasted each other on a job well done and best soon forgotten 
 sitting in business class waiting on <unk> <unk> my third double vodka and bitter <unk> i did a quick tally : the company was in this one instance losing its sr. staff geologist cum exploration manager senior <unk> sr. <unk> sr. <unk> sr. reservoir engineer drilling engineer operations geologist logistics manager senior surveyor 3 secretaries <unk> of the aforementioned senior crowd and the <unk> manager 
 a small company total 50 or so total employees could <unk> the loss of 2 or maybe even 3 of their senior level employees but not this mass <unk> 
 my good friends whom we left behind <unk> us for months regarding the situation in the office come sunday ... bloody sunday 
 once the realization of what had happened the gm went completely off the <unk> '' totally shithoused '' and completely <unk> '' or <unk> on that theme 
 the first <unk> of recognition of the severity of the of <unk> <unk> if jeers about to <unk> upon him were when all calls to various abodes were answered with that number is no longer in service 
 please check <unk> ... '' 
 emails went <unk> however our <unk> were still working although we all blocked herr dickhead 's number though we still allowed text messages 
 text 1 : where are you 
 why are n't you at work '' 
 was just the beginning 
 in the words of <unk> <unk> <unk> we let him eat static '' 
 text 2 : where the fuck are you 
 if you do n't get you asses in here immediately ... '' and other such impotent threats 
 yes please 
 i 'd love another drink '' 
 rising panic ensued : text 3 : this is n't funny 
 come in and we 'll act like this never happened ... '' we all sat on the plane anticipating <unk> 
 by the time we hit london it was <unk> local time but <unk> <unk> time 
 herr dickhead gm called an emergency meeting of the remnants of his staff all locals and demanded to know what they knew about this huge display of insubordination 
 dunno '' never heard a word '' why 
 what happened '' and where is everybody '' 
 were the responses 
 herr dickhead blows a <unk> and immediately <unk> everyone left in the office 
 unfortunately all that were left were a couple of <unk> who are always in demand and a bunch of locals 
 due to the country 's <unk> '' plan it would be easier to fly a fully loaded <unk> through the hole of a <unk> than it would be to dispose of a local <unk> worker 
 long story short he could n't and was instantly reported to the proper ministry in charge of such matters as one of the secretaries was <unk> to the <unk> of employment affairs it 's all <unk> nepotism in this part of the <unk> 
 final damages : loss of 10+ senior employees 
 fines of over 5,000 <unk> due to improper business practices firing locals 
 loss of 2 drilling <unk> due to lack of personnel and inability to provide work as per contracts and <unk> of drilling of 2 active wells into the hole so to speak about us $ <unk> each and 10 or 12 field development wells 
 so long cash flow 
 loss of a <unk> seismic contract worth approximately us $ <unk> 
 adios exploration program 
 loss of <unk> '' meaning you take a back seat to all who try and tender <unk> seismic crews etc 
 good luck <unk> oil country <unk> goods logging or completion services and pretty much all field related activities 
 loss of face with several <unk> no small item here huge <unk> is placed on <unk> and perceived <unk> 
 au <unk> field development plan acceptance or seismic contract approval 
 loss of 6 locals to the national oil company 
 figured if expats deserted this <unk> of idiocy <unk> as an oil company they should bail as well 
 ultimate temporary closure of the office <unk> of all field activities payments of <unk> % on <unk> loans and contracts and loss of several <unk> <unk> <unk> and transfer contracts 
 they had to continue to pay the still employed locals basically sending them a check for sitting at home playing xbox and loss of 25 % of their <unk> due to <unk> of contracts with the government 
 last i heard herr gm dickhead is <unk> around south texas trying sell some sort of <unk> and shady oil deals with companies who have seen their own projects <unk> by <unk> oil prices 
 funny thing is he keeps running into people now on the other side of the desk who both know him and in one or two cases actually worked for him 
 one receives a special <unk> schadenfreude when you lean ever so slightly forward and tell him to fuck off '' and do n't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out you might suffer brain damage '' 
 tl : dr general manager at an oil company treats all his staff like shit 
 so we work together to cost the company millions of dollars 
 and cost the gm his <unk> know a lot of people have been waiting for this update 
 **this shit gets better 
 ** if you have n't read the original post check it out here to clear up a <unk> from last time - i <unk> call the police at the time of the incident and they would not come out because it was on private property 
 when i left you guys last time the police were about to serve this dude the paperwork 
 i had found him and i was awaiting a phone call from the sheriff 's department with a confirmation 
 but their phone call was n't the best news 
 they arrived at the defendant 's business address and no one was at the address 
 the deputy told me he could try again tomorrow but i was already not a fan of the way the police had acted until this point so i told him to leave the paperwork at the police station and i 'll take care of it myself 
 i enlisted a coworker david to serve this guy instead 
 i drove david to the place of business - a two story <unk> business complex with grey <unk> and 70 's style brown <unk> 
 the defendant 's place of business was on the second story in a dark corner amidst other small businesses 
 it was extremely quiet and not one of the offices upstairs were occupied 
 david knocked on the door with no answer 
 however there was a mail slot in the middle of the door 
 we looked through it and saw that the office '' was about the size of a mini <unk> with a <unk> desk and a <unk> pc 
 nothing was on and there was no phone 
 we called the phone number i had tried earlier and no one answered 
 so we went downstairs hoping to speak to another business owner as to the whereabouts of this guy 
 for some reason the empty office gave me a really uncomfortable feeling 
 on the first floor was a phone repair shop with two sales reps at the counter 
 david nervously asked one of them if they knew who george g****** was 
 the man responded - are you here to serve him '' 
 dave laughed and asked how he knew that 
 the man told him that they get people in here every week attempting to serve george g****** 
 so this dude has been running from people for quite a while 
 i need to tell you here that reddit really helped in this investigation 
 one user <unk> told me about colorado 's secretary of state website 
 i used it and found another business address for the same company 
 david and i drove there but the office space was completely empty 
 those were the only two leads i had 
 i felt defeated and without closure 
 the last resort i had was a user /u/semyonov who offered his private <unk> services to me on another thread 
 i messaged him and within one hour i was on the phone with him giving every piece of information i had about the defendant 
 <unk> we 'll refer to him as p.i '' 
 told me to give him a few hours and he 'd call me back 
 sure enough within an hour he called and went through the full background on george g****** 
 a hispanic male in his early 40 's ... who has <unk> and <unk> against him <unk> all the way back from <unk> the defendant has been all over colorado since 1997 setting up at least 10-12 small businesses - all with multiple <unk> 
 boxes 
 the addresses were impossible to find and the phone numbers were bunk 
 one address happened to be a prison in my hometown of <unk> city co so we assumed he was a convicted felon 
 the multiple businesses this man set up was a telltale <unk> of money <unk> activity 
 he had filed for bankruptcy twice but he recently sold a business in 2013 for over $ <unk> - so he was n't exactly poor 
 unfortunately despite the full record p.i 
 pulled up there was absolutely nothing new for us to go on 
 after a few back and forth phone calls from other attempts - i told p.i 
 that he had done his job and that i had felt a strong sense of peace knowing that not only have dozens of people attempted this very same thing before to no avail but that i had exhausted every resource available to me 
 i went back home and relaxed for the day 
 30 minutes later my phone rings 
 p.i 
 called and told me that he tried another database one that usually does n't pull up many results 
 however this time an address popped up for a home about 15 minutes north of me in <unk> city 
 the home is owned by an asian couple ... but the utilities are in the name of the defendant 
 p.i 
 told me that he could do surveillance of the home at an hourly fee but i told him that i would go by and see if i found anything first 
 i got in my truck and drove to the address 
 the home was among an absolutely gorgeous neighborhood surrounding a golf course each of them worth $ <unk> 
 i rounded the corner for the address and two houses down - the grey dodge ram was sitting in the driveway 
 the license plates matching the photos i took 
 he was at the fucking house 
 i drove down to the end of the street and called p.i 
 i needed him served right here right now while we still have a chance 
 i met up with him at a king <unk> grocery store about two blocks away and he went through the game plan - he would park across the street and use his <unk> to spot george 
 all the p.i 
 needed was a visual confirmation and the papers would be served 
 both the p.i 
 and me carry concealed so i parked two houses down and stood on the sidewalk as p.i 
 pulled across the street 
 as p.i 
 's brakes quietly <unk> as he stopped george came outside and started loading his truck 
 he was getting ready to leave somewhere 
 p.i 
 got out of his car and had his cellphone in his shirt pocket recording the entire exchange 
 p.i asked are you mr. george g****** '' 
 no '' george replied 
 well does he happen to live here '' 
 no no one by that name lives here '' 
 oh really 
 because i know what you look like and your plates and vehicle match up to you '' 
 are you <unk> me bro '' 
 dude ... do n't pull that crap with me '' george surprisingly answered - okay '' p.i 
 gave him the documents 
 we served the douchenozzle 
 we got him 
 we had his address 
 at this point he has to either move to another residence or pay the full amount in order to get out of this mess 
 george and i exchanged looks as he turned to walk back into his house papers in hand 
 i gave him a huge smile and i walked back to my truck 
 the p.i 
 and i met around the corner and i left my truck running while i came up to his car to sign the paperwork and pay him for the services <unk> 
 while i was signing - i heard my phone ring through the truck 's bluetooth 
 i walked back and picked up my phone with the words private number '' sitting across the screen 
 my adrenaline shot up and i could feel my eyes <unk> 
 there was absolutely no one else who would call from a private number at this time so i picked it up while the p.i 
 was scrambling to begin recording on his phone 
 i answered - hello '' 
 a calm smooth voice replied - what 's up <unk> '' 
 i answered back with a <unk> <unk> that i will not repeat 
 george threatened - i 'm coming to your house tonight - and i 'm gon na come up on you '' 
 oh yeah 
 how do you know where i live '' 
 i had intentionally left my address off of his copy of the service notice does n't matter you better watch your back you <unk> mother fucker '' i 'm not even fat 
 as i answered back the phone hung up 
 the p.i 
 was n't able to record the exchange but he pointed to my dash cam - the thing that had already been quite the useful tool before - it was running the whole time with audio to go with it 
 the p.i 
 and i parted ways and on the way back to my house i called 911 hoping i could get him arrested 
 i reported the threat he had just made 
 i was shaken mostly by the tone of voice george had plus the fact that he had spent time in prison 
 he had nothing to lose so why would n't he kill me for $ 1,000 
 the police officers were ... you guessed it ... unhelpful 
 they told me it was n't a real threat because he did n't specifically use key words like gun '' or knife '' or even hurt '' 
 so they refused to come out but i could go in on monday to request a restraining order 
 it was friday night and a piece of paper was n't gon na do much anyway 
 i was thankful that i was carrying at the time and that i had more than one weapon at home 
 i went home and did a quick google search 
 if you type in my name and zip code which was on the copy of paperwork george received my home purchase is public fucking record 
 the very first result is my address 
 great 
 so i started packing my weapons into my truck set my home video cameras to record talked to my neighbors had my roommate go to her friend 's house for the weekend and left 
 i met up with the <unk> who attempted several times to get the police to come out and at least file a report to no avail 
 after waiting for a while i went to my girlfriend 's house and stayed there for the weekend <unk> logging in to my cameras from my <unk> and checking on the house 
 fortunately he did n't show up and my neighbors did n't report a grey ram driving around the area 
 i laid low for the next three weeks 
 my bumper got fixed and this morning i walked into the courtroom with my pages of pertinent documents videos and audio recordings and waited 
 george did n't show up and the surprisingly very rude judge ruled in my favor by default for a total of $ <unk> 
 my next step is to have p.i 
 go back and serve him with <unk> - a piece of paper which has him declare any assets his banking accounts etc 
 if he is served the <unk> and he does not comply a bench warrant is issued for his arrest 
 throughout this whole time george has n't done anything illegal technically 
 colorado driving laws state that insurance is not required on private property which the home depot parking lot is 
 so i 'm hoping to get these papers served and get a criminal charge against him 
 if i do n't it 's really not a big deal 
 i got under his skin enough that he had to call and threaten me and that makes me a happy man 
 seriously thank you all for the advice and well wishes 
 this was a great ride and it would be awesome if a local newspaper could pick this up 
 i reached out to <unk> and <unk> 31 denver a few weeks ago and neither have replied 
 i highly recommend /u/semyonov 's services he 's an incredible p.i 
 with a ton of patience and understanding and is very good at walking you through the entire process 
 any fucking questions there 's a disabled man <unk> <unk> that lived in my town up until recently who uses his disability to make his living 
 he sued several local businesses for ada violations even if he never bothered to enter the some of the stores 
 some settled their suits and paid him a nuisance settlement with an agreement for him not to come back other smaller businesses just closed their doors and everyone was out of work 
 he sued the business i work for even though it was a new location and completely inspected and certified as ada accessible by the state 
 we decided to fight him to the bitter end 
 early on we counter sued for our costs in the event we <unk> which is a common practice in cases like this 
 the case got nasty he 'd come in ranting cursing and literally screaming at me all a part of trying to <unk> me into saying something that would help his case while he was video recording the encounters 
 throughout the ordeal he had an almost <unk> attitude and we finally trespass warned him from the property 
 that did n't stop him from coming in and he wound up going to jail twice for trespassing 
 the case continued and we finally went into <unk> where our lawyer ripped his case to shreds 
 he <unk> admitted he had sued us wanting a settlement and did n't expect us to fight him 
 the case continued to progress through time until we finally filed a motion for <unk> judgement 
 we won 
 the case was thrown out and we were awarded a judgement for our costs which were covered by our insurance <unk> $ 85,000 
 the revenge : he moved to a nearby town where he continues suing businesses 
 i set up a google news alert for his name 
 he sued another business the regional paper picked it up in their legal <unk> '' column 
 i got the email and wasted no time calling my attorney and then the defendant involved to offer my help 
 here 's how we worked it : our attorney filed a motion to assume his case using our judgement as a vested interest in the outcome of his case 
 the court agreed and we took his case over and then immediately settled it for $ 10 
 there was n't a damn thing he or his <unk> lawyer could do about it 
 he can expect this <unk> more times before we quit and i 'm determined to follow through with it 
 it brings me joy to put effort into ruining his little shit <unk> this story is from quite a while ago in one of those <unk> white <unk> of the retail world a chain video store 
 my chain store had a lot of management turnover as well as franchise turnover '' meaning we were passed between a couple of franchise groups before landing somewhere in <unk> 
 this along with the fact that all of the employees knew the management login and password meant that we had more power than we should have and little to no threat of firing or legal repercussions i remember a kid lifting and selling a bunch of new <unk> of <unk> before the official release date 
 now being a family place '' the 2nd biggest national chain and being the store with the biggest selection in an area of <unk> <unk> we had a lot of issues with entitled <unk> and kids but this was one of my favorites 
 there were 2 of us <unk> the counter so i stepped out and started asking customers if they needed help finding anything 
 there was a mother with 4 kids the youngest being a toddler in diapers wandering around the video game section 
 i asked if they needed help and was given something of a <unk> in response 
 lacking a translation for <unk> groan '' i simply said i was around and if they needed help just <unk> 
 i noticed the toddler was <unk> on his diapers and doing a duck walk but being 20 and not experienced with kids i was n't aware just what that <unk> 
 note that she never asked to use the restroom or indicated that there was an issue 
 i did the rest of my rounds and returned to the video game aisle where i noticed what looked like a trail of chocolate covered raisins leading to the toddler 
 thinking the little shit had helped himself to our treats which were stupidly in reach of <unk> little shits i looked for the box only to see another round one drop from the <unk> 's leg 
 i was a bit shocked with that but then he started pulling at his diaper dropping more and more while mom is ignoring his <unk> and waiting in line 
 i walk up behind her poke her shoulder and ask if she would like some <unk> a bag and cleaner to take care of her little shit monster and she replies that it is n't her job and is n't that what we are getting paid for 
 now she is 3 spots back in the line so i tell her that i can help her out on my register 
 i scan her card and promptly note on her account that her kid had shit <unk> the floor and that their account was permanently disabled 
 i told her that the system was n't taking that card and asked if there was another account for their family there was one for their teen and one for the husband 
 i got the phone number and looked up the other accounts repeating the same note to all of them and using the manager code to mark all of their quite substantial late fees as to be sent to collections '' 
 i then smiled and cut the card up in front of her and told her that since she ca n't respect the store or the employees and since she is unable to control her children and refused to clean up after them that she her accounts were locked and that she was banned 
 she tried to use the other accounts but i told her they were <unk> locked too and that her household was flagged so they could n't get any new cards 
 she flew off the handle screaming and shouting yelling that cleaning the floors there was n't her job it is when your <unk> decides to shit all over it and that she would call the manager owner or corporate and report me 
 i told her to go ahead nothing would happen to us 
 she grabbed her kid still dropping <unk> and screamed for the rest of her <unk> loading them into the van and peeling out of the parking lot with her middle finger raised 
 she called back that night asking for a manager and i had a real fun time pretending to be chuck the <unk> manager not a real person 
 i told her she and her family were banned from any stores in the district and that we would be pressing charges if her or any of her family tried to open up a new account 
 i ended up having to clean up the shit which sucked so i called up the other video store in the town and let them know what had happened or that they were habitual shop <unk> i ca n't remember but they ended up banned from there 
 they tried coming in and renting a few times even trying to set up new accounts but each time they were flagged both because the incident and their late fees which i guess they could n't pay off now that the account was locked and they were sent to collections for them but i have no sympathy 
 they ended up getting sent to collections and having a lot of issues due to that and tried to call and write the store to make impotent legal threats but i had made sure to put notes up on the desk and the system 
 they came into another job i was working a year or two later and started yelling at me asking why i ruined their lives 
 i told them the truth it was because their actions in the video store were <unk> and that we did n't need customers like that 
 i also said that if they returned their videos on time they would n't have had fees and then they would n't have gone to collections 
 i suggested that they perhaps learn from this experience and <unk> how they treat retail employees 
 this just further enraged them the husband was in my face 
 they were asked to leave and banned '' from there as well 
 seriously though if she would have even apologized i would have let it go but having to clean up her kid 's shit and deal with her attitude 
 that in my mind at least justified the repercussions 
 tl dr : <unk> lets <unk> shit all over my video store and cops an attitude and the family gets banned and gets their credit <unk> as a <unk> my wife and i live in an old <unk> style house in a college town split into two apartments - our 2 bedroom downstairs and a 4 bedroom upstairs 
 the first year it was occupied by nursing students who were great 
 they all finished their rotations and moved out and we got a set of <unk> students who were douches 
 at first we thought oh they 're young we 'll politely complain when they do n't clean up their dog <unk> a tuesday night <unk> <unk> so loud it <unk> our windows they 'll figure it out and it will be ok. well it was n't 
 their response to our requests were annoyance and <unk> which opened the door up for me to engage is passive - aggressive revenge tactics and i have many stories from the year they <unk> above us 
 one monday morning after a pretty raging party upstairs i came outside to find my car parked in by the upstairs neighbor my wife had <unk> <unk> ch for short 
 now in the lease we had exclusive use of the driveway upstairs were supposed to park on the street - however they often parked behind us when street parking was scarce 
 so i knocked on the door to get them to move the car so i could go to work 
 only there 's a problem - ch has left that morning on spring break vacation 
 he wo n't be back for two weeks 
 after i had recovered from contemplating exactly how much of a syphilis ridden <unk> of a human being you would have to be to illegally park in your downstairs neighbor and then leave for two weeks i rang the non emergency police line and explained my situation 
 they tried to contact ch to no avail so my legal <unk> was to have the car towed to a legal vacant spot on the street at my own expense 
 which given i had to go to work was what i would have to do 
 while i was waiting for the tow truck i hatched a mature and a juvenile revenge plan 
 juvenile plan first i got a bottle of <unk> brake fluid and a <unk> out and <unk> the extent of my <unk> <unk> painted a big old cock and balls on the hood with a pew pew pew of pee going over the roof and left it to <unk> in 
 the mature part of the plan came to fruition when the tow truck arrived 
 our city has a penchant for street sweeping and tow cars enthusiastically when doing so 
 they had just put up signs down one side of our street notifying that they would be sweeping in four days 
 i reserved a spot that side of the road for ch 's car and had the driver put it there 
 i let him in on the plan as he was contracted to tow cars for the city that day 
 he <unk> a lot at my slowly <unk> <unk> artwork and said he 'd try and pick up ch 's car early knowing that if he was away for two weeks his company would be able to rack up a nice storage fee 
 the day came and the tow driver who moved the car came straight to ch 's car and towed it 
 i had dropped a note in ch 's <unk> explaining without being rude that he had parked me in and i had to have his car moved at my expense so i could go to work 
 cue him coming back and <unk> pounding on my door 
 where 's my fucking car '' 
 he demanded 
 i explained i had moved it to the other side of the street into a legal car space because neither the police or i could contact him 
 the city had swept the street last thursday 
 they had towed it 
 he 'd need to call the city 
 he stormed off furious only to return a few hours later 
 apparently the combination of the city 's fine the tow fee and ten days storage totaled over $ 1,000 
 and his car had been <unk> vandalized at the tow yard 
 he demanded i pay 
 i politely declined - suggesting that he might try small claims court if he could demonstrate i 'd done anything i was liable for 
 he never took me up on the offer 
 the artwork had come out great - the car had been left in the rain so the giant dick on the hood of his beat up <unk> had <unk> in 
 apparently it even earned him the nickname <unk> in class 
 this one dates back a way to the late 1990s 
 a friend of mine had a small flat as <unk> partly <unk> by the university he studied at 
 there were about 20 flats at this location and they were built in <unk> so everyone shared a wall and roof with their neighbour 
 my friend 's neighbour was a mess of a kid i 'll call m who came into second year uni having barely scraped through the first and spent just about all his available time with loud music smoking and getting drunk with friends over 
 the flats were <unk> but m still managed to cram in half a dozen people several nights a week and the stereo jacked up high with bullshit music and bass far too high 
 my friend 's complaints about it fell on deaf ears 
 he tried talking to m who promised to turn it down did so for a minute or two then turned it up again 
 m stopped answering his door when my friend knocked 
 he confronted m in the car park and asked again and m dismissed my friend 's complaints with it 's just fuckin music mate '' and went on his way 
 police said everyone at the campus needed to learn to get along and did nothing but talk and the university itself was tied up with bureaucracy and nothing ever came of his complaints to housing admin 
 so we took things into our own hands 
 the roof cavity shared between the two flats had only one access hole in my friend 's bathroom 
 we dragged a subwoofer up there and hung it from the rafters over the top of the main room in m 's flat and connected it to my friend 's pc with a soundboard app of music with heavy bass 
 first time round it worked a treat and we were careful not to go overboard in case m found what we were doing 
 m would turn the music up we 'd soundboard it with more music on top and the stereo would go down again while he listened for what was making the extra noise and it gave a tiny bit of relief 
 m did n't stop with the music bullshit but knowing we could really annoy him back was a little victory 
 then another of our friends suggested something absolutely genius 
 he helped rig up a microphone <unk> to the ceiling plaster in the cavity directly above m 's stereo 
 the mic fed into the pc which recorded the sound from m 's house applied a delay and fed the bass back to the hidden subwoofer 
 just a couple of seconds did the trick to make the music <unk> 
 whenever m turned his music up the sub would kick in and play back a little of m 's own music on loop stop then listen again for more 
 the first night we had it going was fine tuning the second was absolutely perfect 
 one and a half seconds delay was <unk> 
 we sat in our friend 's flat listening to m 's stereo go up and down up and down in the middle of one of his parties until he got so pissed off at it that he and his friends left and took their party elsewhere 
 two nights later same thing 
 m had his music up and we let it run clean then as soon as more people arrived to his flat on came the subwoofer and delay and m had a temper <unk> we thought would end them all 
 a couple weeks later m was home by himself and had the stereo up again for an afternoon trying to <unk> the problem and with delay after delay after delay he completely <unk> it 
 he had an epic temper <unk> to beat the last one and screamed broke furniture and smashed up his own walls 
 one simple report to housing admin that he was physically damaging the place and the <unk> cloud lifted and they came down on him & amp he was kicked out 
 from start to finish it took just over four weeks to get rid of him 
 the next neighbour was a pretty sensible guy with no overbearing insistence that his music was what everyone else had to listen to and got on well with my friend 
 mission accomplished and all <unk> long time first time 
 please excuse any formatting errors i am on mobile 
 this is a tale of elementary school pro revenge 
 i was in fifth grade and i will be frank with you no one liked me 
 i was chubby and socially inept 
 this revenge begins with myself and a classmate we will call jimmy 
 jimmy did n't like me 
 he made a sport of harassing me and i being the <unk> ten year old flower i was was naturally distraught on account of his behavior 
 he would exclude me from activities and lunch groups but the final straw was on valentine 's day 
 jimmy <unk> a diabolical plot and i did not receive a single valentine in my <unk> 
 i was crushed 
 after the valentine <unk> he made sure he rubbed salt in my wound by asking to see my <unk> and then laughing when i said i did n't have any 
 i was n't about to take that sort of cruelty lying down so i hatched a plot 
 i spent days and days talking up this new candy type breath spray i had 
 i went on and on about how delicious it was and how my dad got it abroad and you could n't get it here 
 of course jimmy was intrigued and asked to sample it 
 i declined and explained that it was so special and rare that i just could n't spare any 
 one day before lunch i was talking about how delicious it was and could see the hunger in little jimmy 's eyes 
 i pulled my bottle of glasses cleaner out of my backpack and slipped in my desk all fake sneaky like 
 i knew he had seen it 
 it was about ten minutes after this that my plan came to fruition 
 i was walking down the hall and heard a <unk> of sorts so being a curious young <unk> i asked what the fuss was about 
 turns out jimmy had snuck into my desk and drank my glasses cleaner and by the time he realized his horrible mistake he had swallowed enough to make himself quite ill. an ambulance was called and that little bastard never bothered me again 
 as a side note : as an adult i now realize how dangerous this was 
 tl dr- a kid bullied me so i poisoned him.so a few weeks back i sort of got a 2 for 1 deal on revenge but to explain how i need to give a little backstory 
 the first asshole i met in college 
 asshole classmate 
 he was in my major 
 he was the laziest asshole ever 
 our department was lacking students so they allowed him into the program to avoid budget cuts 
 anyone unfortunate enough to get stuck with asshole classmate on a group project was pretty much doomed to do the whole project themselves 
 it was a project built for a group of people to complete in a month 
 being in his group was an automatic c. he never did work and in my case managed to lose all of our work after taking it home to copy it 
 despite <unk> literally nothing he felt entitled to put his name on the project and display it in his portfolio 
 if he was n't allowed to get his way we stopped letting him sign his name on our projects he failed senior and junior year he <unk> you and threatened to call all of your future employers 
 my senior year at that school i got a job in my field 
 it was honestly just a crappy job that was <unk> better than the unpaid <unk> we 're expected to do 
 i had a crappy boss asshole boss 
 he had me do all the dumb office stuff like make him coffee and complain that i was bad at it i do n't drink coffee 
 he was the typical spoiled brat son <unk> a company from his dad 
 he was fond of reminding me that if he knew how to use the software and the tools i did he could also do my job and that he was learning how so that he could get rid of my position 
 to the revenge 
 i 'm out of school i got a much better job offer so i politely told him to go eat a dick 
 of course i got fired for insubordination but i get that sweet unemployment pay until my next job kicks in 
 he fired me at an <unk> time for his company 
 their biggest company is expecting <unk> from us 
 four of them 
 no one knows how to do them aside from me 
 their customer will be there in three weeks 
 in a panic nice supervisor asks if i know anyone that can do job 
 i check facebook asshole classmate is still unemployed 
 i tell him to apply 
 he thanks me profusely 
 nice supervisor thanks me profusely 
 asshole classmate goes to interview with asshole boss proceeds to <unk> me 
 claims he carried me the whole way in college 
 i check his online portfolio my projects are on there with my <unk> still on them 
 asshole boss hires him 
 their customer comes in one week from today 
 nothing has been done 
 asshole classmate calls in sick too much 
 nice supervisor calls me to tell me she is quitting because asshole boss is taking out his anger on everyone 
 asshole classmate complains that no one <unk> him 
 that customer has been waiting for that <unk> for 3 months 
 he is over 70 % of their current business and is not happy with them 
 they will possibly go out of business because of this 
 also i got my friend who is an attorney to send asshole classmate a cease and <unk> letter to take my work off of his portfolio 
 i posted that letter as well as screenshots of him stealing my work on our field 's professional network 
 good luck getting a job <unk> year i moved to a new town partially since me and my brothers obtained a full scholarship for a <unk> highschool 
 we 'd never been in a brick and <unk> school before <unk> and i wanted to make it work 
 i <unk> pretty well but one of my brothers was having some trouble with a grade 11 josh 
 josh was <unk> than a hammer <unk> with <unk> muscles <unk> a grand overall of <unk> % in his courses 
 he was <unk> a professional wrestler who was in the <unk> known for being a sadistic motherfucker that would hurt opponents <unk> 
 looked like he was on <unk> too 
 anyways he tried to insult my brother and he stood up for himself even though he was in 9th grade 
 he got thrown <unk> into a locker and put into a <unk> 
 josh did n't get into much trouble but he got a stern talking to 
 turns out that when you 're in a private school like that as long as you pay the tuition they are n't going to do much 
 i was incredibly pissed off but i did n't do anything rash 
 i could n't take this guy with a knife plus i 'd get in serious trouble so i waited ... 1 year later when we were in 10th grade i was talking to one of my best friends 
 he was a wrestler and when we were talking he brought up how josh had made a 12 year old girl give him a blowjob filmed it and showed it off to the whole wrestling team a year ago 
 motherfucker smiled to the camera too 
 josh was 17 at the time ... i had found exactly what i needed 
 josh had graduated a year ago which meant that he was 18. i convinced my friend to talk to the teachers so we did 
 they contacted the police and child services 
 word had been getting around so more and more witnesses started to talk about what had happened 
 it must 've been a <unk> to josh 's <unk> that word had n't gotten to him 
 the police searched his house found his computer and phone 
 he had <unk> i do n't know how much but it was more than enough to get him thrown into prison do n't know how long either 
 they found the girl in the video and she wanted to press charges too 
 double <unk> 
 he 's now banned from our school the job offer that he could 've had as a coach at our school is gone now and his former coach talked to every wrestling program in the province about him 
 his career as a wrestler is completely over and with a gpa that bad he certainly is n't getting anywhere in his life now 
 i know it was all because of me 
 if i had n't made my friend talk to someone him and all the other witnesses who had seen the video would never spoken up 
 the funny thing is i do n't care that i ruined his life 
 i 'm happy 
 you do n't fuck with my brother and get away with it 
 enjoy prison douchebag 
 **background : ** growing up i lived with my parents in a three bedroom condo unit on the second floor 
 there was only three <unk> in a unit so we had only one apartment above us and one below us 
 the unit is apart of a few blocks worth of <unk> and it 's like its own little community 
 all the neighbors know each other and were always around to offer a helping hand 
 it was an awesome quiet little <unk> filled with families in what was otherwise a very busy part of a large city 
 my parents still live there after 25 years since they bought the place when they first <unk> to america 
 my parents are for the most part very friendly people and had good relations with all our neighbors 
 below us lived a nice eastern european family and above us a large asian family who despite the sheer amount of people living there we never heard a peep from them 
 they were all on friendly terms but it was very much a situation of 'i wo n't bother you so do n't bother me 
 my entire childhood there was never any bad blood between any of the neighbors and for the most part everyone just did their own thing and lent a helping hand once in awhile 
 as a side note : my father worked in construction since he was a young kid and building codes are essentially his bread and butter 
 within the department of buildings and fire department in my state he <unk> a reputation over the past 30 years as being one of the foremost <unk> in understanding building codes and <unk> potential issues on any job site instantly 
 this is important to remember 
 **now on to the story : ** the trouble did n't start until about 12 years after my parents moved in and the nice large asian family living in the unit above us decided to move out and sold the property 
 the new owners did a full renovation of the apartment 
 what they failed to do was properly insulate the floors again 
 which meant we heard every step every little noise this family made at all hours of the day 
 seriously it was bad especially when you 're trying to sleep in only to be woken what sounds like a rolling bowling ball on the floor at 6am on a sunday 
 when this problem first occurred my father went and spoke to the owner 
 he explained how by not adding insulation was a violation of several building codes and also a direct violation of the <unk> contract they signed that stated that insulation in floors and wall is a must 
 this asshole owner ao pretended not to speak english even though we constantly heard him yelling in english on the phone 
 my dad was quick to call him out on it and when ao was caught he started yelling in asian <unk> broken english that he could n't understand him and that my dad needs to learn english 
 now english is not my dad 's first language or even his third 
 he taught himself when he first came to america and got a job as a <unk> in a fancy hotel by reading newspapers 
 he has a heavy eastern european accent but you can easily understand him and he 's comfortable enough to hold a long conversation with someone in english 
 to hear this man yelling at him to learn english was not only rude but downright insulting 
 ao did this every time my dad tried to approach him about it during the time of his renovation to change the floors 
 after six months there were no more contractors coming into the unit and it was clear that ao had no intention of fixing the floors 
 my dad tried one more time and got the exact same response from ao my dad said fuck you i 'll see you in court '' 
 i do n't remember the exact way of how things were done but i know my dad got a building inspector to see the place and they were issued at least a few fines for violations but still refused to fix the floors 
 my dad then took them to court using a decibel meter to measure how loud the sounds from their apartment were to us 
 this trial lasted two years before the judge issued them a court order to fix the floors and ordered them to pay a set amount to my dad 
 again ao paid the money to my father but after six months still did n't fix the floor 
 in fact in those six months it was louder than ever 
 it felt like they were purposely walking louder running and moving furniture at all hours of the day 
 i had taken to sleeping with music on to block out the noise 
 my father had enough 
 it was then he decided to take things into his own hands 
 he placed some orders on the phone and got my uncles together 
 one morning they came back with huge boxes from the electronics store 
 they used the money from the court settlement to buy several thousand dollars of those heavy bass speakers you see in clubs and in <unk> 
 now remember my father knows his stuff after years and years of both working on construction sites and working as an engineer 
 for the next three days my father and my uncles all strategically cut holes in our ceilings one hole in every room in the house 
 they would <unk> a speaker inside do the wiring and then strategically insulate it so they could direct the sound 
 then they patched the holes right up as if there was never a hole there to begin with 
 that very night they finished all the work we were relaxing in the living room watching a movie when the stomping and running starting 
 my dad casually leaned over to our stereo system and turned it on 
 i saw him <unk> with it for a moment before he turned the volume up all the way 
 <unk> from our ceiling came the sounds of cotton eye joe 
 we could just barely hear it with the television on inside but when you stepped onto the balcony that was directly below the balcony of the people living upstairs it sounded like they were blasting music from their apartment 
 my father played that song on repeat for over an hour and well into the night 
 they stomped angrily on the floor for a good while but still that song played on 
 they banged on our door which my father answered and yelled at him for playing the music 
 he just opened his door <unk> so all you heard was a loud tv and my dad said you guys are the ones making the noise '' and closed the door in his face 
 for the next year whenever the neighbors were running or stomping around my dad would <unk> cotton eye joe on full repeat 
 they called the cops on us a few times but my dad would just turn off the music and show the cops the court document that stated it was the neighbors with the noise violations 
 after about two times the cops never came again 
 ao moved out after a year and a half <unk> cotton eye joe '' 
 the place stood empty for awhile until my dad found out that ao decided to rent the place out without fixing the floors again 
 for the next few years that place must have gone through at least eight different people renting it 
 my dad always spoke with the renters before they moved in and explained the court order on the apartment on the noise level 
 whenever they got noisy my dad had no problem blaring cotton eye joe '' on full blast 
 a few months ago the unit went on the market 
 real estate agents had to disclose that there was a court order on fixing the floors in this apartment 
 two days ago my father closed on the upstairs unit at almost half the cost of the original listing price 
 tl dr where did he come from 
 where did he go 
 where did he come from cotton eye joe 
 **edit : ** i just spoke to my sister and she reminded me of how at one point we heard them ripping up the floors to look for the source of the noise 
 because of they way the insulation was placed they could never find exactly where the speaker was located 
 i remember they looked for it for a good while and then right after the construction noises stopped was when we came home to find a moving truck outside 
 <unk> : my dad is getting a kick out of your comments 
 he wanted me to tell anyone who is thinking of following his example is to put the speakers in an insulated wooden box with the speaker side facing up and then line the insulation a few feet around the speaker 
 this is supposed to direct the sound so that its coming from several directions at once 
 and he answered some additional questions for me 
 he did approach the board about it before the lawsuit but they told him they ca n't do anything about it because it was a private matter and was only <unk> him and not the everyone 
 also ao was responsible for a lot of his legal fees so my dad did not lose much money on this whole thing 
 let me just start this story off by saying that the guy who did this apparently has a long history of doing similar things and just generally being a dick although i did n't know this at the time 
 so this has been a long time coming to him 
 earlier this year i got an innocent friend request from a guy named nick over facebook 
 he did n't seem familiar to me but we had a dozen friends in common so i figured i 'd probably met him online somewhere and just did n't remember exactly where from 
 it was n't so bad at first he did n't really comment on any of my posts nor did he send me pms and so i quickly forgot about him 
 a couple of months later i make a completely innocuous post on facebook the topic of which <unk> my memory - but let me assure you that it was completely <unk> and was not insulting or dramatic at all in any way 
 one of my online female friends amber responds 
 and then nick starts commenting too which i think nothing of at first 
 but then amber has the audacity to disagree with him and that 's where the <unk> begins 
 within seconds i was getting hundreds of notifications from that post all from nick 
 in response to my friend amber <unk> disagreeing with him he decided to start spamming 
 i quickly butt in and very politely # <unk> asked him to please stop spamming my wall 
 his response was then to stop spamming letters and to start spamming pictures of his dick instead 
 i was trying to delete them but he was posting them faster than i could delete so i <unk> <unk> politely asked him to stop spamming dick pics on my post because i had real life friends and family members on my facebook account including my mom my dad my brother my opa and all of my cousins aunts and uncles on both sides of my family 
 for some reason he took this as a challenge and started spamming pictures of his dick onto *every single post on my facebook <unk> 
 at this point i had gotten pretty tired of asking nicely so i just deleted him off facebook and sighed heavily as i proceeded to spend the next fifteen minutes cleaning up my wall 
 it took him approximately <unk> seconds to begin spamming his cock via private message instead 
 i asked him once to stop he kept going 
 having realized by now that he was not going to stop i then blocked him 
 problem solved 
 <unk> 
 * within minutes i am receiving dozens of dick pics from multiple other obviously fake facebook accounts from the exact same guy 
 i block all of them but they just keep coming - at one point i counted that he had over twenty <unk> accounts probably for the express purpose of harassing women over facebook as i was to learn later 
 this went on for weeks 
 every now and then after believing that i 'd blocked all of his accounts he would send me another message or i would get a friend request from someone who i thought i knew and it would start all over again 
 it even got to the point where he had managed to track me down on some other websites and was sending me dick pictures on them too 
 i <unk> use the same username for everything 
 i should probably fix that 
 one innocent day i logged on facebook and bam 
 there he was again 
 dick pics in my inbox 
 something finally snapped in me and i said fuck it 
 if he wants to play this game then i 'm going to do it better '' 
 i <unk> him on his main facebook account 
 he noticed within a couple of hours and started sending me pictures again 
 i very clearly told him i 'm going to give you one more chance to stop 
 if you do n't then know that you are responsible for what i do next '' 
 another dick pic 
 okay then 
 here we go 
 i casually peruse his facebook profile 
 within minutes i spot the information i 'm looking for 
 the first thing i do is type up a very polite and 'concerned message about nick 's <unk> behavior to his lovely sister and <unk> mother 
 did they know that their <unk> was in the habit of sending pictures of his meat and two <unk> to random women on facebook against their will 
 could they perhaps talk to him for me 
 i 'm at my <unk> end i just do n't know what else to <unk> 
 i 'm just a nice canadian girl i do n't know how to handle this sort of thing 
 just for good measure i also include a screenshot of some of his many many pictures 
 the second thing i do is take a peek at his place of employment and the city that he lives in 
 i put the information through on google and find that there are only two locations of the restaurant he works at in the area where he lives 
 okay good so he must work at one of these two places 
 it 's <unk> am and i 'm not doing anything else i start calling 
 i tell my sad sad story of harassment to the managers 
 could they maybe help me locate him 
 one of the managers coincidentally happens to not only be his manager but also the mother of his best friend 
 she is completely disgusted when she hears what i have to say and promises to speak with him about it 
 the third thing that i do just for good measure is tell him everything that i 've just done 
 just because i wanted to watch him squirm 
 at first he arrogantly <unk> that i must be <unk> he believes that he 's hidden his tracks well enough to avoid being tracked down 
 he confidently demands that i tell him the names of his mother and sister to prove that i 'm telling the truth 
 so i do 
 and his phone number 
 and his address 
 and his place of employment 
 a lengthy lapse in the conversation <unk> 
 understandable of course he needs time to process 
 less confidently he begins trying to convince me that his sister and mother do n't care so i should go ahead and do it anyway so that they can all have a big laugh about it later 
 i 'm not convinced - his sister 's facebook is full of posts about church and god 's love i seriously doubt that she is the type of person who would approve of sending photographs of your <unk> to unsuspecting <unk> over the internet with the intent to harass them 
 i tell him that i 've already done it so i guess we 'll find out soon enough if he 's right 
 he writes one more <unk> <unk> message and then logs off 
 game 
 set 
 match 
 i win 
 -- - following this comment is a series of screenshots that i took to prove that my story is true 
 the <unk> part of all of this is that his sister actually responded to me - and <unk> <unk> was not the first time he had done this* 
 i also spoke to a mutual friend of ours about him who told me that a girl that we all used to know had accused him of attempting to rape her while she was passed out drunk on his couch 
 she never had him charged or anything but i found out later that he was well-known in our group of acquaintances for being somebody who regularly harassed and assaulted women and even occasionally men 
 <unk> warning : explicit photographs of male <unk> in the link 
 ** edit : if you have a question about the veracity of this post please try reading the comments because there is a fairly high chance that i already addresses that specific concern at some point 
 thank you 
 i am super getting tired of people making the same accusations at me that i 've already answered four times in other comments 
 edit # 2 : if you require more proof please pm me personally about it 
 i do have more screenshots i just decided to take them down off here because i think people were able to track him down using the information in them and i do n't really want to <unk> him 
 a summer 's afternoon i found myself in the rafters of a warehouse meticulously <unk> out zip ties at 3 each <unk> running <unk> cables <unk> off with <unk> <unk> ends 
 i am a man who is very particular about his wiring and this day was no different 
 by this time i was about 6 days into the job and my big bundle of 48 cables was almost done 
 the <unk> of my network were spread throughout the building and everything was beautifully <unk> off and bundled together in a trunk of cables held together by <unk> <unk> and color <unk> zip ties 
 all in all i had spent over $ 3000 worth of time in this project and well over $ 5000 worth of equipment 
 the day came to collect payment 
 the payroll person was n't there so i dropped off the bill on her desk 
 1 day passes 
 2. almost a week before i call them and ask them about it and they give me the run around 
 i did it as professionally as possible 
 i emailed i called i left messages and nothing 
 the bill was sitting at $ 3500 
 i thanked my <unk> to have had them pay for the equipment before i installed everything 
 3 weeks flew by and they stopped answering my calls specifically and my emails 
 it was time 
 i sent them an email telling them that at the 30 day mark as per our agreement of <unk> the bill would have a late fee of 25 % and i would shut down their server 
 early on the <unk> day i logged into their server and changed the passwords and set it to shut down 
 i had a bios password so there was no way they were going to have someone else come and reset the server they 'd lose everything 
 all of their data from the last 5 years was locked onto that server and i waited 
 at <unk> the next day i got a frantic call from the owner telling me something was wrong 
 i asked him to check his email and he told me that he read it but that they needed the server back on 
 they were losing so much money '' 
 so i went over and walked inside and was greeted with <unk> smiles and fake <unk> 
 the owner talked to me about pleasantries and started leading me to the server 
 i asked him if he was serious and that i was n't doing anything until i got paid for the job + the late fee 
 that 's when everything kind of went to hell 
 the owner got really upset and started trying to string together something coherent and eventually just got up in an angry huff and proceeded to have the payroll person type me up a check 
 i took the check and left directly to their bank to cash it after telling them i 'd be back in an hour or so 
 i took the money and <unk> it at my bank 
 once i got back i forgave them for trying to guess passwords of the bios and logged back into the server and started everything running 
 i billed them for my time and got payment before i left 
 i never heard from them again 
 this happened 6 years ago but i was thinking about it yesterday and decided to write it now 
 so once upon a time i was married 
 it was a good relationship for the most part 
 good communication and seldom any arguing 
 over time my wife meets a guy let 's call him dan 
 dan on the surface seemed like a cool dude 
 he and my wife worked together and seemed very close 
 i did n't really care they were co-workers 
 everybody has that co-worker they 're close to right 
 over time i sense that dan and my wife are getting too close 
 she texted him constantly and i started getting suspicious but i did n't want to say anything because i did n't want to come off as jealous 
 one night i <unk> through her phone and found some explicit texts she sent to dan 
 it basically confirmed that a she was cheating on me and b she wanted to leave me for him 
 even though i was pissed off that she cheated on me i also wanted to get out of this marriage asap 
 the next day i sat her down and told her i knew everything 
 there was a lot of tears on both sides and denying on her side but she finally confessed her affair 
 she basically told me that she loves him and not me 
 we agreed that we would get divorced <unk> 
 no alimony and whatever was ours before the marriage is ours after it 
 it was a very quick divorce 
 now as much as i wanted to kick the shit out of dan i did n't want to risk going to jail 
 at this point they were in a relationship living together 
 considering she has known him for less than a year at that point i knew things were going to end badly 
 a couple of months after the divorce i moved to the west coast 
 i had no communication with my ex from then until a month ago 
 she messaged me on facebook and told me she was sorry for how she treated me and that she 's miserable and misses me 
 i decided to look through her profile 
 she 's married to dan has 3 kids with him and they 're both <unk> fat 
 apparently soon after they moved in together she became pregnant with his kid 
 she had to quit her job because of the pregnancy and since then has n't had a job 
 they got married while she was still pregnant and had 2 more kids 
 they 're living off food stamps and government aid too 
 at that point i felt vindicated 
 i wanted to get revenge on her and dan for so long 
 to see they fucked up their own lives so bad was good <unk> i was younger think <unk> i was the family it guy 
 still am actually 
 back then i used to help <unk> people free of charge due to my mother whoring me out for her friends and co workers 
 i did not like it but i had little say about things 
 honestly it was a minor annoyance most of them were pretty cool people and appreciative of my help 
 the biggest thing that annoyed me was my mother volunteering me when i had other plans 
 i did it until the fateful day i dealt with harpy '' 
 harpy was one of those late middle aged bitter as shit women you find every so often not one positive thing came out of her mouth 
 i honestly have no idea why my mom wanted me to help her 
 she brought me her computer loaded with viruses and malware 
 when she dropped it off the only thing she said to me was fix it '' no thank you no description of the problem <unk> 
 so i get all the malware cleaned off viruses removed get it going again i almost had to completely wipe it and reinstall windows it was so bad 
 i give it to my mom to drop off to harpy 
 about a month later harpy complained to my mother that i had broken her computer and it did not work right 
 so my mother brings it back home 
 i look at the computer and figure out what happened 
 the idiot woman reset all her icons to arrange by name by accident 
 fyi if your getting free help do n't try to cover your own incompetence with it 's your fault you touched it and it broke because of you '' when i originally got the thing was so <unk> with malware and viruses it barely boot up 
 lucky for me i had a backup 
 i kept a rolling backup of all the computers i worked on before i touched anything for 5 computers just in case shit like this happened 
 i <unk> all the viruses and <unk> my mom give your friend back her computer its just like it was when you gave it to me last time 
 the next day i got a call from the harpy literally screaming and cursing at me telling me your was an idiot s & amp <unk> kid who does not know computers 
 how dare you break my f & amp % # <unk> computer '' ect 
 ect 
 fortunately we had an old <unk> answering machine i picked up the same time as the machine it got everything 
 that was that i had had enough 
 i took the bus to my mothers work she came rushing out thinking something horrible had happened and i played the recording for her 
 when it finished i told my mother from now on its 30 bucks an hour with 2 hours upfront 
 or i 'm not touching a damned thing 
 she took it and whenever one of her friends asked for free pc work she played the recording for them 
 saying that 's why i wo n't help anyone for free anymore 
 word got around the office that not only had harpy screamed at their co-workers kid but cost everyone their free personal slave 
 the pro part comes in about a year later 
 my mothers boss asked my mother if i was still fixing peoples computers she said yes 
 he wanted to hire me part time over the summer to help out the regular it guy and wanted to set up an interview 
 my mom told me 
 i called the guy up and we set up a time 
 the interview went really really well but i did not want to work with the harpy who screamed at me 
 i asked him if harpy still worked there he said yes she does do you know her '' 
 i told him i did know her and i cant take the job due to an event that happened about a year ago 
 he of course asked what happened i said i really do n't want to get into it but he could ask my mom she can give him details '' 
 come home told mom how the interview went and she still had that tape i could hardly believe it 
 about 2 months later harpy got the axe 
 apparently she was sweet as could be to the boss and a complete bitch to everyone else 
 the tape was enough to get the boss to start looking real close at everything she did 
 my mom still <unk> at how fast harpy got written up for shit she had pulled for years 
 tldr : got <unk> out as a free it guy as a kid so i got an old crone fired 
 edit : if you find any mistakes please feel free to message me english was never my best class i would be more than happy to change things for <unk> sake sorry in advance 
 edit 2 : a couple words thanks guy 's 
 this happened a few years ago but is honestly a very proud moment for me 
 so i 'm driving home from my parents house and it 's about <unk> oclock in the evening on a beautiful summer night 
 they live in a small quiet suburb and i 'm only a few towns over so the drive is usually pretty nice and peaceful 
 however these towns tend to breed entitled pricks and bored teenagers 
 i must have ran into the <unk> of the two 
 as i was making my way down a <unk> i was going about 30 road toward the center of my parents town i see one of those small honda <unk> in my rear view that is really low to ground and decked out with all kinds of stupid shit 
 he 's <unk> in hot and i 'm thinking he 's going to blow by me or something 
 nope just gets right on my ass and at one point i 'm pretty sure he even tapped my bumper 
 i can see the stupid smirks on the faces of the driver and passenger 
 we come to a stop sign and i do my best to do a full 
 complete 
 stop 
 i reach over pull out a cigarette light it and enjoy a drag before i start to move again 
 must have taken at least 10 seconds 
 may not seem like a lot but next time you 're at a stop sign wait ten seconds and you 'll see how long that is 
 anyway this <unk> him as he barely stops when he comes up to it and continues to very dangerously tailgate me 
 so now i try the brake tap 
 i pull up a little to give my self some room and hit the brakes forcing him to slam on his 
 i found it funny cause he had to swerve to avoid collision 
 he still does not heed his aggressive driving 
 the revenge : now we get to the big 4 way intersection in the middle of town 
 2-3 lanes at each stop 
 he pulls up beside me 
 i must have really scared him with the brake tap because he looked very flustered and wanted to say something to me 
 he rolls down his window all my windows and sunroof were all ready open seeing as it was so nice that day and looks at me 
 i look at him 
 i was expecting some sort of verbal insult so i made myself ready 
 hey you faggot piece a ... '' before he could even get that <unk> thought <unk> statement out of his mouth he was already <unk> on the lit cigarette butt i <unk> directly into his mouth 
 when some of my friends and i were younger and would just be hanging out we made flicking cigarettes a game 
 we would set up little cans or targets near one of our habitual smoking places and we all became very good at it 
 now i knew i could hit him in the face but i did not expect to get it into his mouth 
 but i do n't feel bad in the slightest 
 the best part : so while he is dealing with his new <unk> dinner i turned left left turn lane 
 he must have missed his turn to go while dealing with the cig so other cars started crossing the intersection 
 i 'm sure he was fuming mad so he peels out cuts across to make a left and almost hit 2 cars in the process at least it looked like that through my mirrors 
 i see him make his way onto the street i was on 
 but right behind him was a cop who must have seen him commit about 12 moving violations as he cross that intersection 
 i see him pull over and i drive away feeling like a boss 
 **tl/dr : guy dangerously <unk> me i flick a cig in his mouth and he gets pulled over by the cops 
 ** edit : <unk> have been lurking on this sub for a long time and finally decided to write down my own pro revenge 
 i will delete the post in case i feel threatened or uncomfortable but until then ... enjoy 
 this is going to be a long story as it took years to end so bear with me 
 also english is my second language so <unk> me for grammar mistakes 
 everything started when i was around 16. i was drugged sexually assaulted and very traumatized from that event 
 i could n't remember much from it only the cold feeling and some smells so i could never actually press charges against the rapist 
 also i was very alone in the whole situation - <unk> from a few friends i had i had no one to actually rely on 
 my parents were emotionally abusive towards me so i learned not to trust them from my young age and telling them about my problem was out of question 
 i just could n't do it 
 so it happened and it took me a lot of <unk> to get back to my normal self 
 i was depressed for a long time developed anxiety and became self destructive i drank way too much and did way too much drugs 
 during that time i met a guy let 's call him douchebag db for short 
 i met db over facebook he claimed to have met me in the club which was possible 
 yes i went to a club when i was 17. no i did n't even need fake id 
 he seemed nice and i even met him over a cup of coffee for a few times 
 after a while i started really liking him but there was something just very off about him ... and i could n't put my finger on it 
 he was one of those rich kids spoiled little brat who liked to pretend he was very scary and important <unk> style 
 db was also 5 years older and because he had money i never heard him talk about doing anything other than football and going to clubs 
 i found it laughable but i let him believe what he wanted 
 he also acted like he liked me in a sexual way but did n't do anything about it 
 there were just some remarks that made me think that way 
 he was also friends with people from my high school and this is important 
 i hung out with him and we did regular stuff - got coffee talked i would rant about my parents he would joke with me 
 just normal stuff 
 after a few months of our friendship i even told him what happened to me when i was 16. he did n't show much <unk> and asked a few questions that seemed <unk> much but i did n't think much of it i was just glad i told someone 
 months went by and i was less and less self destructive 
 it dawned on me i needed to change my ways stop with the drugs alcohol and stupid <unk> 
 that 's why when db asked to meet me for a coffee i told him no 
 i realized along the way that he was shady as fucking hell his friends were weird i had no idea how he spent his days he treated me with little to no respect and he always chose small shady <unk> to meet with me as if he was embarrassed by me 
 i have had enough of it and told him so 
 what i told him did n't phase him at all 
 he left me alone as if i never mattered 
 after a few months i started hearing rumors about myself 
 they were so nasty so incredibly horrible and the whole school talked behind my back about it or even to my face 
 i was called a slut and what not and <unk> into depression once again 
 i did n't think db would do it because from time to time he would contact me and acted very nice and also he was not exactly the only person who could hate me 
 you know how high school is 
 the shit hit the highest point when i was 18 almost <unk> by that time i somehow managed to deal with nasty shit people were talking about i managed to deal with threats of violence and name calling 
 i also found a beautiful boyfriend - he was my rock someone who i could rely on someone who took care of me and gave me comfort and safety 
 i was with him for 6 months and i have told him about my past 
 i thought it was important for him to understand why i was who i was 
 i kept my boyfriend very private 
 i did n't share our relationship on facebook or any other social media 
 i did n't talk about him a lot 
 only a few people knew about it and that was the best decision i ever made 
 db contacted me from time to time he kept telling me i changed and joked how he liked me better before because i was spontaneous and fun to be with 
 yeah because doing fucking drugs and being suicidal in my free time was so much fun right 
 i stopped speaking to him completely and again he did n't seem to care 
 it was one month before my final tests in high school 
 i was going to school studying hard and hung out with my boyfriend i was trying very hard to fix what i ruined years ago and that was me my reputation and my grades 
 i was in school one day and checked my inbox on fb which i almost never did just to find a message from some guy i have never met asking if i was <unk> 
 against my better judgement i told him he might have sent the message to a wrong person and he immediately answered that he had n't 
 i was puzzled sitting in my german class and staring at my phone 
 i asked who is he and the guy started insulting me calling me a whore and told me i will do what he tells me to do otherwise he will put the video of my rape online 
 i was now freaking out to say the least 
 i thought he had to be joking and told him so and that is when the worst message of my life came 
 it was a picture 
 of me 
 a detailed picture to say the least 
 i felt so sick 
 i got up without saying anything to the teacher and got the hell out of that class barely holding myself together and bawling in panic as i stared at my phone 
 the first thing i decided to do was call my boyfriend 
 i could barely speak over the phone i was hysterical so he picked me up and took me to his place 
 i told him about everything and then it started to make sense all of it 
 db had to be a part of that shit 
 my boyfriend told me to keep talking to the guy while he called a few people to see who this guy was 
 he seemed to be in his thirties had a dog and lived in the <unk> part of the city 
 his fb profile was legit he existed and was n't afraid of me knowing his real identity 
 i asked what he wanted from me 
 i would almost puke every time i had to answer but i had my bf with me and he was furious 
 the guy knew my address and my mothers name and threatened with that too 
 he said i can choose if i wanted to get naked on cam or have sex with him 
 his ended up demanding that i meet up with him and have sex with him 
 my boyfriend told me to invite the guy to meet with me in the open - we knew he would n't want to sit and drink with me coffee but my bf could n't let me just go to the <unk> 
 this is where we made a plan and it was going to go down the very next day 
 i had to meet with the guy on a little square near his place surrounded by a park 
 it was remotely abandoned at that time of the day and i sat down on a bench shaking and trying to keep myself together 
 my boyfriend told me this half of the plan but did n't actually tell me what he will do 
 finally i was approached by the guy 
 he seemed younger than i thought and wore that smug smile on his face that made my blood boil 
 he told me to get the fuck up and follow him 
 i was now terrified looking around for my boyfriend but he was nowhere to be found 
 so i had nothing else to do than to follow the guy 
 we were walking on a path i was few steps behind him and he was n't even looking at me 
 i was staring at the ground <unk> on not <unk> 
 all of a sudden the guy stopped in his tracks 
 i stopped too 
 in front of us was standing my boyfriend right in the middle of the path 
 the guy seemed confused and turned around to me just to notice 2 guys behind me my bfs 2 best friends 
 they were just standing there calm and silent 
 now i did n't exactly describe my bf but this is the best <unk> in a sea full of little fish he was a goddamn <unk> 
 older than me his face full of scars and he <unk> that superiority 
 he knew how to be scary 
 i suddenly could breathe 
 my bfs best friend moved me out of the way grabbing my hand and pulling me in the other direction before shit starts 
 i was so stressed at that time that i could barely walk and just as i rounded the corner i heard a muffled scream 
 my bfs best friend took me to my bfs place and hugged me while i cried until my bf came back 
 his hands were bloody his shirt too but i could see he was n't hurt 
 at that time i did n't ask what they did but my bf assured me i was safe now 
 later i found out they beat the guy and made him tell them where the tape was 
 they crashed his phone and went to his place where they destroyed all the blackmail material in front of the guy 
 he admitted he was the one who raped me he stalked me and even sent his friend db to befriend me so he could control me and get info on me 
 db was in on it the whole time 
 later i found out db became well known for abusing barely legal teenage girls along with the guy 
 they would blackmail girls and make them do nasty stuff and all the girls were alone just like i was 
 db ended up getting beaten too ending up in hospital and the guy moved to another country soon 
 i asked my bf if he did something to them and he just laughed but i 'm just happy it ended and i do n't even want to know 
 i 'm still with the same boyfriend 
 we truly delivered pro revenge 
 here 's how the story starts 
 freshman year i had a pretty good life 
 moved out of my abusive moms and into my dads was pushed up to <unk> football made a lot of money selling weed made a lot of friends etc 
 around sophomore year i got into acid and <unk> which pretty much fucked my life up 
 i 'll just cut right to what happened 
 i was raped 
 i went to a party to sell <unk> and ended up staying til about 2 am 
 got lit as fuck and decided to drop some acid while <unk> and on adderall 
 blacked out and woke up near my school with no pants and my bike like 20 feet away 
 chilled with my close friends the next day and they all started making fun of me 
 i barely remember what happened but apparently one of them it go down 
 they started <unk> me on coming out of the closet called me a faggot played the song rap god repeatedly on my stereo and kept <unk> the gay <unk> part so on 
 i ended up kicking them out 
 over the next few weeks is when shit got out of hand 
 everyone <unk> i was gay after that got made fun of daily and life was just fucking terrible 
 few people kept texting me things like hey man i 'll let you suck my dick if you give me some weed '' someone spray painted my car and put sugar in the fuel tank other shit <unk> i ended up <unk> schools which did n't help 
 when i got to the new school almost immediately rumors went around that i fucked a <unk> fucked a dog and/or i fucked a guy 
 at this point i 've heard a lot but those were the main ones that stuck out to me 
 anyway 3 years later 
 obviously never made any new friends and saved a lot of my drug money and got a job 
 moved out and into a new state about a month ago 
 moved into an apartment and going to college next semester 
 before i left i got revenge 
 i graduated 6 months early and what i 'm about to go into detail is over the course of the last few months before i left 
 everyone i mention is still in school ... well some of them 
 when shit initially went down i deleted every trace of myself on the internet <unk> but i made <unk> accounts to keep up to date on what people were talking about me which was a big thing for awhile 
 i screenshotted posts vulgar text messages anything and everything someone did to me i kept it 
 i had it all saved on my computer never thought i 'd go through with anything but my daily life was still a pile of shit thanks to this group of people 
 so everything they ever did i had evidence of 
 when i transferred schools my dad had to go to several meetings with my schools principle 
 my school had a lot of <unk> problems 
 personally before i left i knew 4 people who transferred schools freshman year alone because of shit like this 
 one because she was a <unk> one because she was fat one guy who was homeless and the last i do n't remember 
 but at these meetings the principal told my dad that i could have the people who did this held <unk> and the school takes this shit very seriously 
 i said no way in hell my life was already a mess i did n't want to bring attention to myself i just wanted out 
 3 years <unk> i brought in about 100 pages of me being shit on by fellow classmates online 
 i went in after hours and she the principal was still there and remembered who i was 
 i told her everything i just said now 
 the rape not the drugs just said i was drunk the vandalism everything 
 i told her how people at the new school started doing the same things to me as the people here how when i saw them in public they made a big deal about it how they ruined my life 
 page after page of harassment bullying threats 
 she brought in the schools police <unk> who called in 2 other officers 
 we went through every single paged <unk> everything identified everyone involved and i filed numerous police reports 
 9 people 
 i essentially ruined the lives of 9 people 
 i believe most are facing felony harassment lawsuits as is one confessed to <unk> my car one was immediately charged with possession of weed and paraphernalia they searched her car and i believe most were expelled on the spot 
 none of them will receive their <unk> <unk> unless they weasel out of it 
 for 3 years i sat in agony for the things these people did 
 for 3 years i thought about how i could get revenge if at all and what the best way to do it was 
 out of all the things they did to me and everything that happened i can say without a doubt that after seeing their <unk> i 'm finally at peace 
 this is a little long sorry about that but i 've been waiting decades to tell this story 
 i grew up in a small town in the south 
 summer jobs were hard to come by unless you wanted to drive an hour away to the city 
 we had a few mechanics some gas stations a general store and a church on every block 
 there were a lot of farms around that would hire high school kids but summers in the south are hot and humid 
 the holy grail was an <unk> job with air conditioning 
 the summer before my senior year i thought that my buddies and i -- let 's call them fred and ben -- had landed an awesome job at the general store 
 the owner who i will call dickface needed three people to unload the trucks and stock shelves in the morning 
 we had to report for work at 5 am but it was only three days a week and we were done by 10 meaning we had the rest of the day to lay around and fish 
 now there were some red flags that i being young did not recognize at the time 
 the fact that dickface wrote <unk> slips at the end of every week instead of checks was a huge one 
 he promised to pay us in full at the end of the month 
 we were kind of pissed that we would n't have money to spend but it was an easy job with good hours so we kept working looking forward to that sweet paycheck at the end of the month 
 with it being an <unk> job there was n't too much i could do 
 the time comes 
 dickface tells us at the end of our shift that our paychecks are clipped to our time cards 
 ecstatic to finally be paid we go in open the envelopes ... and see that we have each been given a $ 50 gift certificate to the store 
 the strange and growing mixture of confusion and horror is a set of feelings that i will always remember 
 fred ben and i approach dickface behind the cash register and <unk> ask when we are *really* going to get paid 
 he looked at us like we were the dumbest people he had ever seen 
 that <unk> your pay '' he said 
 we called bs and demanded real checks 
 well i ca n't do that 
 all i can give you is the gift <unk> '' 
 what happened next was what you 'd expect from a couple of pissed off high school red necks 
 obscenities were shouted 
 some things were thrown 
 fred kicked over a candy display 
 we stormed out of there swearing and i was just seeing absolute red 
 that fucker had used us for <unk> labor 
 * took advantage of some high school kids to get free work for a month 
 it went without saying that we were thirsty for vengeance 
 now this was a long time ago 
 like <unk> <unk> storm long ago 
 and we lived in a very rural area 
 so we could n't just call some bureau of labor or go <unk> on social media or whatever people think of as revenge '' these days 
 hell we could n't even really tell our parents cuz they would have said it was a learning experience or some such thing 
 there was really no <unk> of worker 's rights or anything like that 
 hell in this particular state there still is n't to this day 
 we had to handle this ourselves 
 from then on we had nightly meetings on a piece of property owned by fred 's dad 
 there was only one purpose one subject of discussion : revenge 
 we went through all the usual options -- arson vandalism and so on 
 but in the end we decided that straight out theft would be the most reasonable option 
 we were <unk> for a month 's work and for the <unk> of justice to balance we needed payment 
 as i said this was a long time ago 
 dickface had some cameras but they were poor quality and there were only a few 
 one out front one by the register and one over the beer coolers 
 there were no cameras in the loading dock or the back room where the beer <unk> was stored 
 we knew this because we had seen the little <unk> <unk> in dickface 's office 
 there was also an old doorway that was boarded over and sealed with <unk> in the back of the building but was otherwise unsecured 
 in other words our work was cut out for us 
 we parked in the woods behind the store and watched it for a few nights to see if dickface had taken any additional security precautions in light of his deception 
 he had n't 
 the closing cashier just locked the front door at 9 pm and left 
 we met up the next night at about 2 am 
 the town was dead asleep 
 we piled into fred 's <unk> pickup truck drove to the store killed the headlights and pulled up to the loading dock 
 my heart had been <unk> in my chest the whole drive over but now a sort of steel calm had come over me 
 i was <unk> yet calm as the eye of a storm 
 our time had come 
 the wooden door went down with ease when ben put his shoulder to it 
 we slipped into the backroom stationed ourselves in a sort of <unk> line by the beer racks and we unloaded the place 
 cases of beer and <unk> of wine practically flew out the back into fred 's truck with <unk> efficiency 
 in the space of maybe less than twenty minutes we had the back room cleaned out 
 we cleaned out that fucking prick so fast i do n't think he would have had time to shit his pants if he somehow caught us we would have been done and gone 
 we pulled the <unk> door back into place threw a <unk> over our loot and drove to the same property where we had held our vengeance meetings 
 there was a <unk> tool shed towards the back behind some pretty thick bush and that 's where we had decided to put everything 
 unloading and carrying all the stuff took <unk> longer than snatching it even with a <unk> and the sky was starting to shade pink by the time we had it all squared away 
 nevertheless we were all able to make it to fred 's house before his parents woke up and got suspicious 
 the next few days were tense 
 i saw two sheriff 's <unk> parked in front of the store the following day and felt the bottom drop out of my stomach 
 we had come up with a cover story and rehearsed it multiple times in case we were questioned and i expected cops to come knocking on my door any second ... but they never did 
 i never even saw a report on the local news 
 in hindsight dickface probably knew it was us but did n't want it to get out that he had used slave labor in his store 
 hell i bet the only reason he called the cops in the first place was so he could file a report and write it off on his taxes 
 in any case we had hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars worth of beer sitting in an old tool shed and as young southern boys it would be a <unk> sin to let it go to waste 
 we started celebrating '' cautiously at first 
 but it did n't take long for word to get out that there were a couple of guys who could get their hands on beer and by the end of the summer we were hosting <unk> on the property that were absolutely packed with high school kids 
 we even had some offering to buy the beer from us and by the beginning of september we had made back any money that we lost out on thanks to dickface 's <unk> shenanigans 
 these <unk> included a fair amount of chicks and i think it 's safe to say i lost my virginity thanks to the stolen beer in the shed 
 it was the best summer of my life 
 as for dickface i never saw or heard from him again 
 he sold the store a year later to a guy who seemed much nicer 
 i got another job working there the following summer for actual paychecks 
 the beer did n't even run out till the start of senior year 
 the last i saw of it was chugged by fred at the end of a football game 
 tl dr boss does n't pay for a month of work 
 we steal lots of beer get laid and have a great <unk> november 17th 2010 i was involved in a major vehicle accident 18 year old kids fault 
 i was in the hospital for 6 days and was on disability home rest for 3 months for recovery back <unk> spine 
 when i was coherent enough to deal with business i started talks with his insurance company 
 from the very start they low <unk> me on price from just about everything 
 $ 600 value for a $ 3500 car kelly blue book valued it at $ <unk> and i had a brand new paint job on it from 3 months prior their value : $ 32 and 4 brand new tires not even 2 months old valued : $ 5 a tire 
 they brow beat me into thinking that this was how the processed worked 
 nearly convinced me to settle 
 this insurance company wanted to cut me a check for $ 700 bucks and some change within 5 minutes of talking to me 
 the negotiations started <unk> and i could n't get them to budge for nearly a week 
 i talked to my lawyer and he could n't help but gave me great advice 
 i got additional advice from my own insurance agent on how to deal with them and basically asked professionals on how to approach this 
 it turns out this insurance company the kid used was the <unk> last resort of the last resort kind 
 my lawyer who dealt with the medical bills not car issues told me *edit : removed apparent personal <unk> with the record this kid had he was paying close to ** $ 1600 every 6 <unk> 
 he was <unk> by all standards but it was his insurance company that was the worst of the worst 
 they were playing the <unk> tactics game with me 
 what they had n't planned on was a guy with nothing but time on his hands and my <unk> had definitely been <unk> 
 i inquired on every single item in and on my car 
 i located receipts got estimates on everything i had and <unk> them with <unk> and paperwork 
 at every opportunity i begged and pleaded with the companies i dealt with in estimates to over inflate the price of the cost 
 $ 700 repair for a leather jacket $ <unk> for a <unk> <unk> laptop $ <unk> for designer '' jeans probably <unk> signature if i recall 
 this insurance company only <unk> a bit on the fair market value price so they started playing a new game with me 
 not taking my calls or not responding to my emails 
 when my claims adjuster agent did call back my phone would ring once ... as in 5 seconds and he would hang up so it looks like they made an attempt to call 
 i would immediately return the call but would get *your claims adjuster just stepped out of the <unk> '' or *he 's headed into a <unk> '' from the <unk> 
 nearly 3 weeks of these phone tag and email <unk> games led me to create a detailed <unk> of my agents whereabouts and excuses of why he could n't take my calls 
 i then upped my game 
 i called his bosses talked to other agents and told my story to all of them 
 when that got no where i upped my game even more 
 i called **every hour on the <unk> for 8 business days in a row 
 i was on a first name basis with 4 of his co-workers knew his supervisors name and bosses name and had all of their <unk> and email addresses on speed dial 
 i was even <unk> all of them on every email i sent so my agent had 0 excuse that he did n't get my calls 
 shortly after a settlement offer was sent via email as he refused to talk to me at all over the phone in the amounts of $ <unk> for my vehicle and $ 1200 for my personal items 
 i wanted $ 3500 and $ 1750 and was n't going to settle for less 
 he chose to make this personal and not business so i did the only logical thing ... i made it business in the worst possible way 
 i called on a friday afternoon and left a message on ever co-workers phone as well as the supervisors phone that because my agent refuses to negotiate properly nor return my calls that i would now be calling all of them every hour on the hour as well as the supervisor and boss 
 leaving detailed messages to call me back and offer me what my vehicle and personal items were worth 
 i stated i would be starting this on monday morning 8am sharp 
 needless to say by tuesday afternoon i had a settlement offer of $ <unk> for my vehicle and $ <unk> for my personal effects 
 dollar figures that were very fair and almost generous in the industry but i replied back with the following 
 <unk> what bothers me is that i would have settled for less than this amount far earlier in the negotiations 
 but after all this time and effort i will not settle for anything less than $ 3530 for my vehicle and $ <unk> for my personal effects 
 i will start calling again tomorrow morning until these terms are met 
 * '' within 2 hours of leaving that message i had a new email with the settlement offer of $ 3530 for my vehicle and $ <unk> for personal effects 
 i accepted much to their delight 
 **tl : dr <unk> insurance company tries to use lowball and scare tactics to get me to settle for less than the value of my car 
 i <unk> them with <unk> and emails every hour on the hour for almost 2 weeks 
 ** *edit : this post was temporarily removed because some unnamed '' redditor claimed pi was shown 
 its since edited and the personal information removed and its now back up 
 mod approved once again 
 *i 've been a real estate broker in chicago for nearly 20 years 
 i started at a very small independent brokerage 
 it was my first week there when the <unk> gave me a lead 
 he was older and was n't in very good health so he passed a lot of his leads to his agents 
 one of the broker 's friends passed away and the friend 's son wanted to sell the house 
 i call the son who tells me he 's known the broker for <unk> years and how close their families were 
 he seems like a really nice guy 
 i go over and check out the house 
 i work up a gorgeous <unk> market analysis 
 i have other <unk> check my numbers i was new and wanted to do a perfect job for my new client 
 i <unk> my presentation have my stuff professionally printed prepare for any possible questions have responses ready for objections and i head out 
 i <unk> this guy with my presentation 
 he likes the $ 135,000 list price i recommended 
 he 's fine with the commission 
 he has no objections but he asks me to give him 2 months to clean out the house give his siblings a chance to go through everything and then <unk> 
 now i know how to handle this but at the time i just said i 'd call him in 2 months to get it listed ... bad move but i trusted him because he and <unk> father were so close with my broker 
 i did n't expect what would come next 
 three days later i 'm driving through town and i see a for sale by owner '' sign in the yard 
 that 's when i realized that i wasted several hours doing work for him and he completely <unk> me and used me 
 i did n't call him back then 
 <unk> i would n't either but that 's only because i 'd have the listing before he had a chance to put that <unk> sign in the yard 
 experience counts for a lot 
 anyway my broker was at city hall about 5-6 weeks later paying for transfer stamps when he just happened to notice in the registry that the previous customer was the son 
 the son had just paid for transfer stamps earlier which essentially meant that the house had sold 
 i waited until the prescribed 2 months '' and called the son for my revenge 
 i played stupid and the conversation went something like this ... me : hey len it 's myzyri over at abc realty 
 i figured i 'd give you a call to see if you got the house cleaned out and repainted because i had a <unk> company call me with info from a doctor looking to move to the area 
 when i talked to the guy i thought about your house and mentioned it to him 
 since it 's only 2 blocks from the hospital where he 's going to be working and i told him how nice it was he basically told me to make you an offer <unk> 
 i could n't remember what i said the house was worth but i told him $ <unk> 
 he could n't believe how inexpensive it was but he 's living in new york 
 he said your house sounds like it 's three times the size of his and half the price of what he 'd pay in new york city 
 so i do n't remember what i told you it was worth but he 's all cash and wants to be able to move in in 3 weeks so would $ <unk> work for you because i can write it up fax it over to him for <unk> and get you done ... 
 there was a long silence before he exploded 
 len : you fucking asshole 
 you told me it was worth $ 135,000 
 me : well we did n't even list yet and it looks like i just got you $ 80,000 more 
 what are you all upset about 
 len : i just sold that fucking house 
 i sold it for $ 130,000 because you fucking told me that was what i should expect to get 
 me : oh damn you sold it 
 that 's good for you and good to know that that my estimate on the sale price was spot on 
 well no problem i 'm sure i can find something else for my buyer 
 len : fuck your buyer 
 i want $ 80,000 
 me : i do n't know where you 're going with this 
 you sold your house for a price you were happy with 
 i just happened to get an out of <unk> on a fluke who was willing to pay more 
 but hey you sold it and you got fair market value so you did great 
 len : fuck you you prick 
 i want that $ 80,000 
 me : i 've never heard of this before but if you can get the house back i can talk to my buyer and see if he 'll wait for you to close again 
 i do n't know if that 's even a possibility 
 len : no 
 you 're going to pay me $ 80,000 
 me : well that 's not going to happen 
 i can just hire a professional <unk> to show that you got market value for the house 
 my mistake was quoting my buyer the wrong price not you 
 len : you can expect to hear from my attorney 
 me : that 's fine 
 but i 'm going to have to let you go now len 
 i 've got to get over to your old house to see if the new owners would be willing to give me a copy of their appraisal and see if they might want to sell it for a quick profit 
 do you know if they moved in already 
 len : mother fucker 
 and that 's when he slammed the phone down 
 i would never do this now even though i have plenty of people who waste my time 
 it comes with the job and getting upset does n't make it better 
 however i still think about that call today and while part of me feels like a jerk i still get a little smile thinking about him kicking himself for screwing me over 
 here 's a little more to the story ... something i do to drum up business is offer help finding tax <unk> for people so they can try to get a tax reduction from the county 
 i actually went to meet the new owners of that house and offered to help them dispute their taxes free of charge 
 they were actually a really nice couple and they ended up using me to sell that house 8 years later just before the market crash 
 so they 'd done some really nice stuff to the house had a top notch price and they ended up getting $ <unk> for it 
 they were doing a <unk> closing sell one and buy the new one on the same day 
 the house they were buying burned down but they still sold theirs and moved in with relatives while they looked for something new 
 the market literally crashed two months later while they were living with the wife 's grandparents 
 they stayed there for two more years and then i helped them buy a huge 4000 square foot foreclosure for $ 130,000 
 new construction that had n't been completed 
 just needed trim a garage some light fixtures and a kitchen which they were happy to install on their own considering the price and location 
 it 's currently worth about $ <unk> since that area is just booming again 
 they 've been very happy with me and have sent me a few <unk> 
 as a side note i told them about len a very <unk> down version that did n't make me look like a dick and they happily gave me a copy of their appraisal just in case he decided to call a lawyer 
 they said he was a jerk to deal with and got into a huge fight with his siblings at the closing saying he should get $ 20,000 more because he had to handle the sale and that 's what the realtor would have charged '' 
 no ... since his dad was close with my broker we were only charging him <unk> % - $ <unk> on $ 130,000 
 soooo ... did he ever call a lawyer 
 yes 
 about a year later he called the only lawyer he knew 
 another family friend 
 my broker 's brother 
 the brother talked to my broker who then talked to me 
 i gave him the market analysis and the appraisal 
 we never heard another thing about it 
 tl dr : guy uses me and wastes my time 
 i end up giving him a bs story that makes him think he lost out on $ <unk> $ 85,000 
 we all know the saying in order to make an omelette you got ta crack a few eggs '' 
 a very down to earth saying with a lot of meaning and truth behind it 
 i guess you can even apply this saying to revenge in some cases particularly my story of revenge 
 a story of revenge so great that it might be one of the best cases of revenge so far in the year <unk> or at least i tell myself that 
 in the end unfortunately there was some collateral damage but hey you know the saying ... i am a former marine living in a <unk> town that i am not from trying to make ends meet while i wait for my tech school to start this summer 
 i 've been out of the marines for a few years now and after partying day in and day out and making ends meet by bar tending at various bars around my state i have finally convinced myself that it 's time to stop being a <unk> and work toward a stable career 
 hence i 've enrolled myself in a tech school 
 in the mean time i figured can squeeze as much as i can out of the service industry until i complete school and graduate 
 well that was the plan and it still is but not at the <unk> i thought it would be 
 i moved to this town from another state with my girlfriend due to a <unk> in her family 
 after living off savings for a few months i decided to snag a job to make things easier to stay afloat 
 i ended up at a <unk> little restaurant very close to where my girlfriend worked 
 a restaurant recently <unk> by it 's corporate ownership after a terrible franchise owner had control of it 
 all of the staff were new hires from the top to the bottom 
 the restaurant was now full service as opposed to ordering at a counter 
 it had a beautiful <unk> bar that <unk> well with the theme of the restaurant that was <unk> off from the dining side of it 
 great food and even better drink <unk> the perfect place for me to make ends meet while i attend school 
 it was convenient in so many ways my girlfriend and i could save gas by driving in one vehicle when our schedules matched she could come eat lunch or dinner on her break and get a discount on food things just seemed perfect 
 when i first started working at this restaurant management seemed to really like having me around 
 i was very good at entertaining guests i brought people in to the bar and i was great at making drinks 
 one night stands out the most i had a couple walk in to the restaurant minutes from closing 
 often when this happens you will get a server who is upset that they have to do their job a little longer and that will reflect on their service 
 not me it is their money and we are still technically open 10 minutes until we close so i am going to treat these guests just like i would any other guest 
 the couple clearly had a great night and left me a very big tip 
 the next day i was shown an email that was sent to corporate with nothing but <unk> about my service and attitude 
 i assumed it was from the same couple but who knows 
 after that incident the atmosphere and management 's attitude toward me seemed to <unk> shift 
 before we get into that though let 's discuss the management team 
 first we have the gm let 's call him jack '' 
 jack '' is a round man in his early <unk> who on the surface seems like a stand up guy you 'd think he 'd have your back until the bitter end when you first meet him 
 then we have nessa '' the assistant gm 
 nessa '' is a short woman in her late 40s my first impressions was that she is a quiet but professional woman does things by the book 
 and finally we have courtney '' 
 courtney '' was the bar manager '' i will explain the <unk> a little further in the story from the <unk> courtney rubbed me the wrong way 
 courtney was in her late <unk> and never really smiled 
 something about her just seemed dishonest i could n't quite put my finger on it at first 
 oh and i should also mention kara '' 
 kara '' was a woman about <unk> years old and she was best friends with jack the gm 
 she was the other bartender for the restaurant that would work shifts that i did n't work 
 in the end i had nothing but great things to say about kara and i did n't want things to end the way they did but hey you know the saying ... now back to the story after receiving the positive review i noticed i would get <unk> from both nessa and courtney for little things 
 they would reprimand me in rude ways without any <unk> 
 one night nessa out of nowhere told me i was arrogant 
 of course i <unk> myself and this caused a dispute that ended up with both of us apologizing i still have no idea what i was apologizing for but i just wanted a peaceful end to the matter 
 another day courtney pulled me aside as i came in for my shift and told me that guests had told her that i was giving them free drinks she tried to get me to <unk> up to this and i <unk> denied the claims i even told her to check the cameras or i will have jack check the cameras 
 i never ever stole from the bar or gave people free drinks 
 then there was that time i came in for a shift and courtney immediately jumped down my throat for leaving tables a mess '' later proven to be a lie before leaving the bar after closing she says this as she walks out the door from her morning shift leaving three tables <unk> 
 it was like something out of a <unk> sketch 
 another thing that may have struck you as odd courtney the bar manager '' was scheduling herself bar shifts while getting management pay 
 odd right 
 my theory on this sudden change of attitude toward me from the management is that it may have not been so sudden at all 
 i do n't think courtney liked me from the start i remember one time when i was training i had to make an easy drink for a guest because she did n't know how to make it 
 she put <unk> juice n a long island <unk> tea ... <unk> 
 this was probably embarrassing for her and i remember the guest making a comment along the lines of maybe he should be bar manager 
 hahaha '' said in <unk> but i could tell that it really upset courtney 
 i also was told that by another employee that during a busy night over the holidays courtney told nessa and jack that she thought i was stealing from the bar 
 i can not verify these claims but after the conclusion of everything that happened i would n't put it past courtney 
 this negative stigma toward me most likely rubbed off on jack because surely enough his attitude toward me changed 
 i started to feel held <unk> and <unk> going to work 
 i felt as though my <unk> was being <unk> behind my back my reputation was being <unk> i was <unk> in <unk> and had no way of defending myself when all these claims were made behind my back 
 one shift my girlfriend was on her lunch break and while i was in the back getting side work done jack had made a rude comment to her or was very rude to her 
 she was n't clear when she told me about it later that night but she did n't feel comfortable going back in there 
 her feelings were hurt 
 i confronted jack about this and he just brushed it off and quickly changed the subject by telling me to find something to do '' 
 all of this hate would soon hit a boiling point and that 's where the omelette comes in ... a little over a week ago i was enjoying a night off 
 me and the gf watched some making a murderer '' ironically relevant to the story before both drifting off to sleep 
 i woke up bright and early the next day did some laundry and got some cleaning done while my gf slept in she works two jobs and deserves it 
 i took a shower and prepared to head in to work hopefully making some good tips 
 i walk in 5 minutes early and the managers are all at a table outside of the bar talking 
 they see me walk in and sat me down 
 they told me that the night before someone had served a minor some drinks and it got reported to the police somehow 
 <unk> it was n't me i thought i did n't even work that night and i always id people i am unsure of 
 they told me that i need to be sure to always id people and i assured them that i do 
 both jack and nessa walked off to the dining side 
 i talked with courtney a bit and the conversation was a bit odd 
 she said yeah we need to be sure to id people and you probably just assumed he was <unk> '' i cut her off and told her that it was n't me who worked last night 
 she <unk> back oh i meant kara '' 
 yeah it was kara who messed up 
 kara who i really loved working with but who was also best friends with jack 
 so you can assume how things were taken care of 
 this would of immediately been my termination if it were me in kara 's shoes 
 i did n't hold any grudge i was glad she kept her job 
 after the doors were locked that night 
 nessa came up to me and brought up the underage incident again it was odd she spoke kind of loud but not rudely and told me i need to be sure and id people from now on so this does n't happen again 
 i stood my ground i told her that with all due respect it was n't me who served the kid 
 she said look i know i am just saying '' 
 what were they trying to pull here 
 i had the next day off chilling in my apartment all by myself playing <unk> eating like a pig 
 when my phone <unk> 
 it was a notification telling me that i need to come in to work an hour early because the managers were having a meeting 
 no sweat more hours more money 
 i continue doing my thing 
 the next day i go in an hour early as instructed once again the managers are sitting at a table near the bar 
 they all stare at me as i walk in things did n't seem right 
 jack tells me that he needs to talk to me 
 jack and nessa both sit me down in the dining area 
 jack tells me that he heard that i had a dispute with nessa a few weeks back and he ca n't have that attitude around here 
 he tells me he is letting me go 
 i was shocked i told him that me and nessa already <unk> out our differences and this happened weeks ago 
 i look over at nessa and she shoots me a smirk well now you are talking to your gm about it '' 
 i felt the marine in me start to come out i was getting angry and about to do something stupid 
 it took everything in me not to throw the table over and punch jack right in the jaw 
 i took a deep breath stood up told them good to go '' and walked out 
 and courtney was sure to give me a <unk> <unk> '' as i walked out the door 
 what the hell just happened 
 this was weeks ago and they are firing me for this 
 this ca n't be right 
 i get to my car and slam my hands down on the steering wheel 
 i was so angry i just wanted to call my girlfriend and hear her tell me everything was going to be alright 
 i grab my phone and find her name in my contacts i 'm thinking to myself how i am going to break the news babe they fired me for no reason 
 jack is such a fucking prick 
 kara served someone underage and nothing came of that but they fire me for something that happened weeks ago 
 i did n't hit the call button i put my phone down 
 it all hit me at once 
 these motherfuckers were trying to burn me for what kara did 
 since it got reported to the police somebody needed to pay and it sure as hell was n't going to be kara 
 i peeled out as i left the parking lot not because i was angry but because i needed to act fast 
 if i did n't act fast they would get away with murder 
 most the people who join the marines join to fight 
 as crazy as this sounds this is largely why people <unk> in the <unk> side of marines 
 people like us have a desire to fight and the marines is a great outlet 
 most marines love fighting most of us love conflict 
 we <unk> off of it and we know how to react when the cards are n't in our favor 
 we are generally some of the nicest and loyal people you will ever meet but you do n't fuck with a us marine ... i open my door and rush to grab my laptop 
 my girlfriend asks me what 's wrong and i quickly say nothing babe got fired love you '' 
 grab my laptop and sit on my <unk> 
 she says what 
 i just motion with my hands 1 second as i load up google 
 i find the restaurant 's corporate website it did n't have a number for corporate but it did have the email address of every single franchise in the company 
 even better '' i thought to myself 
 so i wrote a long email to a franchise copied and pasted it to every other one 
 i explained in detail about the <unk> that was happening with jack and kara 
 i explained how kara had served someone underage and i had the feelings they were trying to pin it on me 
 i explained how courtney would get manager pay while taking tips as a bartender 
 i explained how nessa would occasionally have me make a drink and she would give it to her teenage daughter who also worked at the restaurant 
 i provided times dates and even showed them the email i sent to our state 's alcohol control about the underage drinking incidents to ensure my hands were clean 
 i explained how an expensive bottle of jack <unk> 's sinatra seemed to have a <unk> in it nights after jack had worked 
 every bit of dirt i ever saw or heard about i put in the email and i let every franchise in the company know about it 
 i demanded that i get a call back and i also demanded that i get my termination papers to make sure i was n't being framed 
 i typed so fast and things just seemed to melt in to place as i made the email 
 my fingers were my weapon you do n't fuck with a marine 
 my girlfriend is staring at me the entire time 
 what the hell is going on 
 i finish the email and explain to her the situation 
 she asks me if i am afraid other 's will get in to trouble i tell her ... well you know the saying 
 i fill out applications and the same day i get a call from a very well known and popular restaurant they want me to come in for an interview the next day 
 perfect 
 i already have another job 
 i did n't hear from corporate at all that day it was very late in the afternoon so i expected as much 
 the next day i get a phone call early in the morning 
 it is corporate hr that owns the restaurant that i worked at 
 she tells me that they are on their way to the restaurant to investigate my claims 
 she asks me a bunch of questions i am guessing i was being recorded 
 i stayed consistent and honest she tells me all of the things i mentioned in the email were 100 % against company policy but the claims would be investigated before any action was taken 
 i asked her if they have access to the camera feed she ensured me that they did 
 thank fucking god for cameras 
 she told me to call back immediately if i could remember anything else that was going on 
 we hung up and i got dressed and headed out the door for my interview at a new potential job 
 well the interview could n't of gone better 
 i met most of the management at this team and i got such an amazing vibe from them 
 they even want to cross train me as a bartender almost immediately 
 most of the time this place only <unk> from within they must have really liked me 
 so i got the job and i am going to try my hardest to be a great employee 
 anyways back to my revenge story 
 i later got word from an <unk> that they did indeed try and pin the underage incident on me 
 little did they know ... i am laying in bed that same night drifting off in to sleep listening to sam <unk> 's <unk> my girlfriend is sitting up in bed browsing facebook 
 all of the sudden she gasps 
 she startled me because i was almost asleep i jump up and asks her what 's wrong 
 she shows me her phone ... <unk> wow '' 
 i said calmly 
 i guess things were worse off there than i thought but damn i did n't expect things to get taken that far 
 well you do n't fuck with a marine i thought 
 i got out of bed and made some sweet tea 
 do you feel bad '' 
 the gf said 
 well babe you know the saying '' 
 edit : thanks for the gold 
 edit 2 : let 's not <unk> people what 's done is done and justice has been served 
 no it is n't the restaurant people have been posting pics of 
 edit 3 : names have been changed from letters to fake names to make it easier to <unk> back my friend 's bf left her in a load of debt and she bore near all the cost of him moving out and then some as he <unk> racked up credit in her name 
 in a fit of revenge planning at the time she took advantage of the wrong idea with the right offer at the right time and got a credit card in his name thinking she could use it back at him the same way or use it as leverage if he started the same shit up again 
 she was broken into a couple of months ago she was pretty sure it was him and the wheels of justice have been turning slowly regarding that but among the items her ex stole was his own credit card 
 he banged up <unk> on it before confronting her last week about it being his card not hers 
 he 's an idiot and just walked into a pit of his own creation 
 hell <unk> apologize up front for the rather lengthy post but it 's all true and was my greatest revenge 
 it all starts about 10 years ago 
 i was happily engaged to a girl who i knew for about 9 years but had only been dating for about 1 year 
 let 's call her nancy <unk> '' all was good she had her dream engagement ring we had a nice house together both had steady jobs and the wedding plans were coming along nicely 
 about two months prior to the wedding we found out we were going to have a baby 
 such happiness had never been felt before 
 wedding plans continued and the big day was only 28 days away 
 i come home from work and find that nancy is n't home 
 i call her to see if she got held up at work and to see what time she might be home 
 but nancy was n't at work she was at her grandmother 's house in another state 
 nancy calmly told me that she no longer wanted to get married and that she was not coming home 
 complete and utter shock 
 what in the fuck just happened 
 i try to call her back her phone is off 
 i call her grandmother no answer 
 what about the wedding 
 what about our baby 
 what about everything 
 no answers 
 no contact for three days 
 three days of no breath in my body no clues nothing 
 on day four nancy shows up and starts packing her stuff 
 she wo n't say a word to me 
 nothing 
 she leaves and sends me an email saying that she ca n't be with me again no reasons 
 i begin calling her sister and asking what the fuck happened 
 her sister tells me that she has no idea but gives me their mom 's phone number 
 strange nancy said her mom was out of the picture because she was an abusive alcoholic 
 nevertheless i call mom 
 mom tells me that i am lucky number three who has fallen for this trap 
 nancy cut mom out of her life so mom could n't ruin nancy 's game of <unk> guys for money and resources 
 nancy has been pregnant twice before and had <unk> '' and <unk> guys for everything she could before running off to super christian grandma 's house and claiming abuse so grandma will take her in until the dust <unk> and she can do it again 
 what 
 the 
 fuck 
 weeks go by and still no contact with nancy 
 i 've lost 20 pounds and have been <unk> at my job for poor work performance 
 my family is mad as fuck 
 family members lost money on travel plans to the wedding and i am mortified 
 i lost all of the deposits on everything for the wedding since it was less than 30 days before it was cancelled 
 i 'm piss broke 
 i check our joint bank account negative $ 2k 
 fuck 
 guess i wo n't be paying the mortgage 
 i start to get my shit together and my sadness turns to rage 
 i had so much anger inside of me i actually had to scale it back a bit or i might have gone to prison 
 a month and a half after the split i get a text 
 i had a miscarriage you stressed me out too much and my daughter is dead now '' ... ... daughter 
 i was having a daughter 
 you 're blaming me for this 
 that 's it i 'm going to kill this bitch ... .. no wait ... breathe ... get your shit together ... take this bitch apart at the seems 
 a few days of <unk> and whiskey get me over the <unk> of sadness again ... back to rage ... let 's do this 
 most of nancy 's shit was still at my house which i have to walk away from because i can afford it 
 i start to pack it all up and in order to get rid of it somehow 
 but i stumble upon a few things 
 her résumé and her checkbook to her personal bank account 
 i read her résumé it 's all bullshit like everything else 
 i hop on the computer create a new yahoo email address and send a long letter to her corporate office telling them <unk> how it 's all lies 
 feels good 
 operation checkbook 
 i sign her name on every check and rip them all out of the book 
 i drive 30 minutes to the <unk> part of town and leave them on a sidewalk in front of an am pm ... too much good stuff 
 i go back home and throw out all of her shit 
 fuck it 
 sue me bitch 
 except her laptop i keep that shit 
 two weeks go by 
 nancy calls i do n't answer 
 voicemail says she got laid off due to cut backs 
 i know that 's not true 
 fuck yeah 
 two more weeks go by and letters from some district attorney 's bad check restitution program begin to <unk> in the mail 
 fuck yeah 
 oh and the registration renewal for her car 
 <unk> all that shit 
 oh while i 'm at it i might as well put a change of address in for her at the post office 
 where to 
 the temporary shelter for the homeless sounds good 
 i hear through a mutual friend that since nancy is out of work now she is staying with friends and supported financially by super christian grandma 
 fuck that 
 i hop on her laptop and make a new yahoo email address that is only one number different from nancy 's real email 
 i email super christian grandma a video of nancy finger blasting herself that i had saved 
 i titled the email hey grandma check out this video i took of my job i hope i uploaded it right '' fuck yeah 
 email reply 
 you are disgusting 
 i hope your new job pays well because i 'm not supporting you if you act like that '' oh <unk> a two for one deal 
 embarrassment and financial <unk> 
 <unk> 
 weeks go by and i get a call from rent-a-center 
 wtf 
 oh they want all of nancy 's furniture back 
 i had no idea it was rent to own shit 
 i tell them i do n't have it 
 they argue and say she says in have it 
 i stick to my guns and tell them i do not have it and i do n't know where it is 
 that night i burn it all in the yard 
 $ <unk> owed 
 <unk> 
 i find out that nancy has a new job and as i am planning my next move i hear great news 
 nancy has been arrested and is in jail for <unk> 
 apparently she had some money problems and stole $ <unk> out of petty cash and got busted 
 oh god this is great 
 she fucked herself 
 months go by with no updates and then i hear from a friend that she was bailed out of jail by grandma after only a few days and ended up taking a <unk> bargain for a felony <unk> and three years of probation along with restitution 
 <unk> 
 i hang my hat and call it a day 
 i have gotten my revenge 
 i 'll leave it there time to move on 
 a couple months later the phone rings 
 it 's a repo company looking for info on where nancy is because they are trying to <unk> her car 
 hahaha ok one last nail in the coffin 
 i make a few calls and find the address where she is staying 
 i call the repo company back and give them the info 
 they thank me and say i am eligible for a $ 100 reward if they get the car back 
 no thanks this one 's on me '' 
 nancy is now a felon jobless and a single mom of a kid she recently had from some random guy 
 she lives in an apartment with her brother and his girlfriend 
 i am happily married with a beautiful daughter and a great life 
 yesterday i get a facebook message from nancy 
 <unk> on the marriage and daughter i 'm glad you 're happy '' i reply go fuck yourself : '' she blocked me 
 life is good 
 sometimes taking the low road heals the soul 
 being the only person who can bail someone out is delightful 
 years ago in grad school i was living with my girlfriend 
 her computer had died so she was using my desktop machine to write her thesis 
 she never made backups of any sort 
 ever 
 even though i repeatedly <unk> her of the <unk> of not backing up she shrugged it off with it 'll be fine '' 
 then came the day when i caught her cheating 
 not just flirting with another guy i do n't give a fuck about that but walked in on them banging in the apartment 
 later i also discovered chat logs on my computer as well 
 we broke up and because the apartment was on a <unk> lease at that point i just walked 
 a week later i get a call from her asking for all the files associated with her thesis 
 you know the ones that were on my computer that she never backed up despite my <unk> 
 me : sure i 'll be happy to get those to you 
 for $ 500 '' 
 her screaming : what '' 
 me : oh right 
 those files are incredibly important representing about ten months of work at this point are n't they '' 
 her : yes '' 
 me : that 'll be $ 1,000 then '' 
 her : fuck you '' 
 me : $ 1,100 - and if you swear at me again the price goes up 
 the price goes up by $ 100 a day 
 i 'd act fast or it 'll get pretty expensive 
 it 's too bad there was n't some cheap way to have a second copy of those files is n't it 
 oh and it 'll have to be cash '' 
 i hung up on her 
 in the end she paid $ <unk> we 've all dealt with idiotic craigslist sellers out there but this woman was too greedy not to have this coming to her : i collect vintage road bicycles of which one showed up on our local craigslist for $ 100 being sold by greedy bicycle lady g.b.l 
 it is an <unk> road bike by one of the better english manufacturers of the 1970s 
 at best it 's worth $ 300 cleaned fixed up and perfect 
 as it is now $ <unk> tops 
 i know a good deal when i see one so i email g.b.l 
 with my phone number and tell her i can come by within the hour and buy it 
 shortly thereafter i receive this response in my inbox : ok so i know realize that the bike is worth more 
 i 've upped my price to $ 200 
 give me a call if you 're interested '' 
 it 's not as good a deal as before but it 's still a bike i 'd like to have in my collection 
 this time i call her to confirm an appointment time 
 i have n't been talking to her for 30 seconds before i am informed that the price is now $ 350 based on the latest inquiry she has had which have been numerous '' 
 i do n't mind a bit of friendly competition but this is ridiculous 
 sure she has a right to getting what the market will offer but deals can not be made with sellers that can not stand behind their word 
 i ask if she 's willing to stand by this price if i commit to driving halfway across town to pick it up right that minute 
 no '' 
 lady i doubt you 'll find anyone willing to put up with this nonsense 
 i could drive across town and find that you 've <unk> the price by the time i get there 
 good day '' 
 *edit : i think it should be noted that i 'm really not interested in the bike anymore at this point 
 vintage <unk> were unusually common in my city at the time of this story and i knew - with time - i could put my efforts towards something much nicer and i did with the acquisition of two chrome <unk> <unk> shortly thereafter 
 not to mention that my collection was already quite sizable at the time a fleet of over 15 classic and vintage road and touring bicycles 
 yes i had the <unk> syndrome quite bad back then 
 * but back to the story 
 my last email seemed to end any hope of further discussion ... but too many old movies have taught me that the greedy person is the easiest to have fun '' with 
 especially when spare '' email addresses are close at hand 
 no longer was it about the bike 
 within 10 minutes <unk> <unk> l. had a $ 500 offer from mr. a ready to come by 
 and 5 minutes later mr. b just had to have the bike for $ 750 
 and thus g.b.l 
 told mr. a that the price was now $ 850 
 so mr. a confirmed that he 'd match that offer while mr. b dropped out 
 but then mr. c pops up : will buy now no questions asked $ 1,500 '' and of course g.b.l 
 will take mr. c 's offer any day of the week 
 but mr. c ca n't commit to show up until the weekend - almost a week later 
 that 's fine with her 
 mr. a however soon gets an email with the new $ 1,500 price 
 mr. a can match it 
 but mr. a drops off the face of the earth come his appointment time the next day 
 so she tries to get mr. c back who confirms for that weekend ... then drops off the face of the earth too 
 the day after mr. c. misses his appointment mr. a gets back in touch with our greedy <unk> friend who apologies for his family emergency '' 
 he makes an appointment for the weekend after 
 ... and mr. a misses that appointment too 
 in the meantime mr. b wants to know if she 'll do his $ 750 as the ad still appears to be up '' 
 ... and mr. b does n't show up for *his* appointment 
 and thus begins a vicious circle of emails from bicycle lady to mr. a b and c as she desperately tries to get at least one sucker with more money than brains to her doorstep following three weeks of <unk> 
 of course nobody ever replies - and by this point no *real* buyers from craigslist are willing to bother with her nonsense either 
 and so the bike disappears off craigslist 
 but almost exactly a year later g.b.l 
 posts the bike back up 
 same seller name new pictures nothing done to improve the bike 's condition 
 the asking price is a flat $ 500 
 thus i emailed her from my original address as myself just to be a pest : remember me lady 
 when you want to talk about that $ 200 price again give me a call 
 maybe you 'll actually get to sell it this time '' 
 <unk> my work is pretty relaxed about theft 
 we trust each other not to take anything without asking first and that <unk> to food 
 we 're all adults and we know better than to steal 
 i only lock my locker so a customer ca n't wander in and take something not because i 'm worried about my coworkers 
 anyway we had a food thief <unk> up 
 it was becoming irritating 
 and then a coworker had a brilliant plan 
 she brought an extra sausage <unk> to work and left it on the break room table as if she was going to come back and eat it later 
 however what she did n't tell anyone until later was that she had gotten a bottle of a dog chewing <unk> bitter spray off the sales floor and sprayed the sausage <unk> with it before wrapping everything back up 
 around an hour later there was a glorious moment when someone on the cleaning crew <unk> from the break room coughing and gagging and making the most awful faces 
 that shit is potent 
 and that person is down a <unk> i was 16 a guy in my chemistry class in the year above and a bit of a <unk> was telling a bunch of people that i 'd slept with some guy also in the year above 
 it was <unk> so when i found out i calmly told him that it was n't true and that i 'd appreciate it if he stopped saying it to people 
 i 'd heard a few days later that he was still telling people and i was really mad so i thought i 'd start a rumour of my own 
 i had to choose a rumour that was ridiculous but not so ridiculous that no-one would spread it but not in a way that would have too negative an effect on his life 
 in the 2nd last class of the day which almost entirely consisted of people from the year above i said to a few people i sat with hey did you hear that tim fingered a cat '' 
 that was it 
 the rumour <unk> 
 teenagers love awkward sex stories and this one was just too awkward not to share 
 plus it was so bizarre that most people would know that it was n't true so no-one would call animal protection on him 
 at the end of the day i was walking home with a friend who had heard from loads of the other people in the upper class about this rumour 
 i did n't even tell her it was me so that it could n't be traced back 
 kids joked about it for the rest of our school days which was only a few months because they upper class graduated after that school year 
 it <unk> into tim fingered his <unk> 's cat '' and people would poke him in the stomach singing na na na na na na catman '' 
 i remember someone shouted it across the social area one day and he exclaimed to a bunch of us i do n't even know where this came from '' 
 and i kept a <unk> smile on my face 
 i went home last christmas then aged 22 and someone said they 'd seen tim catman 
 i 'm glad to hear it <unk> roommate threw a huge party in our room while i was out with friends and when she was super drunk spilled shitty beer all over my childhood <unk> bear and threw him out 
 every morning since i 've been turning her alarm off right after she sets it while she 's <unk> her teeth before going to bed 
 she 's missed her last four 9 am classes officially lowering her grade to a c thinks her phone is broken and is about to spend a shit ton of money she does n't have on a new one 
 that 's what you get for messing with larry <unk> fucker 
 edit : holy shit gold and this is basically my fourth ever post to reddit 
 i love you random <unk> i am a bouncer username relevant 
 backstory : i transferred to a private school in 6th grade 
 because i was the new kid i got picked on a lot 
 i mean a lot 
 i admit i was kind of dorky and chubby but not so much as to earn this kind of taunting 
 my bullying was <unk> by this one kid 
 we 'll call him seth 
 seth <unk> me of <unk> from south park but not funny 
 just mean 
 he would get all of his little <unk> friends and follow me around at lunch calling me names pushing me making me feel like shit 
 even the teachers would n't do anything about it because seth 's parents were very powerful and long time friends of this school 
 i only had one friend the entire year i was there because of him then i transferred because i was being bullied so hard 
 present day : i am a bouncer at the local bar in college 
 proof : i have <unk> my dorky and chubby stage 
 i was the team captain of the football and powerlifting teams 
 i won a national <unk> in powerlifting and was an all district offensive lineman in high school and played <unk> football for a little while 
 i am currently 6'5 <unk> lbs 
 long story short im a big powerful dude 
 heres proof me <unk> <unk> at <unk> at the national powerlifting meet : so anyways im working on a normal night at the bar 
 making sure everything is going smoothly when who would walk in but seth 
 seth has gotten fat 
 seth is drunk 
 seth is not doing well 
 i tried to be professional about it and just ignore him like i did n't recognize him 
 a little while later seth stumbles over to me and says hey 
 i remember you 
 we went to school together 
 it 's me seth '' 
 i responded saying oh yeah good to see you dude blah blah blah '' he said some more drunken <unk> and went off to play pool 
 im above throwing him out for something he did 10 years ago 
 well about an hour later seth is shithoused 
 and he does n't like that he 's losing pool 
 so he starts sticking his finger into the face of the guy he 's playing and starts yelling at this guy that he 's gon na whoop his ass and whatnot 
 i looked at my coworker and said i got this one 
 i walked up to seth and said hey man i think it 's about time that you leave '' 
 seth looked at me and said fuck you bitch 
 i aint leaving '' 
 i grabbed him by his collar and said that was n't a request '' seth turns to me and says you aint gon na do shit 
 <unk> still a bitch like you always were '' 
 so then seth decides it would be a good idea to swing his pool stick at my head 
 i caught it 
 i thought right after holy shit that was the coolest thing ive ever done in my life 
 okay now time to bounce this fucker '' he has attempted assault towards me so legally i can hit back 
 i take my hand off the pool stick and uppercut this mother fucker off the ground 
 as he 's laying there i grab him by his collar and start to drag him to the door 
 he comes to and <unk> his way out of his shirt and stands up 
 i see my fellow bouncers come to help me and i hold up my hand to stop them 
 i want this asshole by myself 
 seth runs at me and tries to tackle me 
 i step sideways and send him <unk> into a trash can 
 you 're not gon na win this fight fatass '' 
 i yell as he gets up 
 this is where shit gets real 
 seth stands up and pulls a knife out of his pocket 
 this has never happened to me but luckily i have knife on me at all times so i pull mine out as well 
 we stand there for a few seconds when a police officer walks in to do his routine check of the bar 
 i know this officer fairly well as he comes to the bar often on his off days 
 the officer pulls out his <unk> and screams drop the weapon '' 
 seth does not comply 
 so the cop <unk> his ass right there in front of god and everybody 
 he drops like the fatass bitch he is and gets arrested for armed assault 
 they run him through the system and it turns out that seth is on probation 
 uh oh 
 so seth gets <unk> off to jail and the police ask me a few questions about the situation 
 everyone in the bar agrees with my story and there is a security tape to <unk> my story 
 the court date has n't been set yet but i have to go and state my story as a witness or victim or whatever i am against ole seth 
 i guess i 'm not a bitch anymore eh seth 
 hope y'all enjoyed the story 
 tl dr <unk> school bully comes into the bar i work at 
 tries to fight me 
 i kick his ass then he gets <unk> arrested and lots of jail time 
 ** edit : hot damn 
 i woke up and l was popular 
 thanks for all of the support guys 
 i 'm getting a lot of ideas for new weapons by the way 
 i had just always normally carried a knife and that was the first time i 'd ever used it 
 i 'll update this when the court date comes out and they notify me what i need to do 
 and if i can get the video then i 'll upload it and let y'all see what i did 
 edit 2 : and no i 'm sorry i 've never seen <unk> 
 please forgive me 
 edit 3 : for the <unk> sometimes things like this actually happen in real life 
 that cop saved my life and i 'm forever grateful that he walked in when he did 
 and if you still do n't believe me this is my first time posting in this sub and really its the only time i 've ever gotten revenge on someone in my life 
 this was all a few years back but about the same time of year 
 looking back i was an easy target for bullies back then but i had never thought that i would be bullied by a girl 
 let 's call her beth 
 beth was the type of person that would cut to the front of the lunch line because her time was more important than everyone else 's 
 she was the kind of person that would mock you if you got a bad grade 
 she was just an <unk> douchebag that felt that the world owed her something 
 and something about me had pissed her off 
 she was a senior and i was a junior and as a result we did n't come in contact very often 
 but whenever she saw my in the hallway or in the one class we shared she would make a point of insulting me knocking my head around or calling me names 
 at my school the period you had gym could change for some people halfway through the year 
 i had overheard that beth 's gym period was changing and that she would be coming to the bio room during the same period that i was there 
 the bio teacher was a really nice woman who let my friends and i hang out there while she was on her lunch break 
 so there would be no adult in this room and i would be almost alone with beth 
 i knew that since there was no adult around she would take the opportunity to mess with me 
 the next day i went to the bio room early 
 i hid my phone behind a bunch of textbooks on a shelf and turned on the video camera 
 then i sat in a chair where i could be seen by the camera and waited 
 when she came in she started mocking me as i had expected 
 called me a shithead and a social reject 
 asked me why i was in here all alone and said that i had no friends 
 messed up my hair and hit me on the back of my head 
 but i was playing the part of the victim : i did n't say a word 
 after she had sufficiently tormented me she logged onto a computer and started doing some work 
 i went over to the shelf and took out a textbook so that i would have an excuse to retrieve my phone 
 i looked at the video that night 
 it made me sad but i knew that i would have the upper hand in the end 
 the only problem was that the audio was shit because the camera was far away so i decided i would do an audio recording the next day 
 i sat in the same seat but i had my phone on the table in front of me with the screen off but the voice recording app <unk> 
 the audio was much better this time you could clearly hear what she was saying to me 
 now for the revenge 
 i knew that if i went to the principal probably nothing would happen and i would n't be allowed to stay in that room at lunch anymore 
 but it just so happened that beth had applied for early admission at a very prestigious very expensive university 
 this college required that if you applied for early admission you must not apply to any other schools 
 it also stated that when you apply for early admission you waive any possibility of getting student aid 
 it was her dream school and her daddy was going to pay for the whole thing 
 pretty much everyone that applies for early admission to this school gets in because the college is making bank off of you 
 so when beth got her acceptance letter she was bragging to everyone that she had gotten into this prestigious university 
 and that 's when i decided to call the college 's admission 's center 
 i had uploaded the video + the audio recording to youtube under a private link 
 i told the admissions officer that beth bullying me on a daily basis and that being around her was a living nightmare 
 i had him view the video and he said he would discuss a course of action with the other admissions officers 
 beth skipped school for 4 days in shame 
 when she came back she was bawling her eyes out to anyone that listened 
 she was devastated 
 nothing had ever gone wrong in her life up to this point certainly nothing this important 
 some people have to learn the hard way in life 
 i never told her that it was me and i do n't know what happened to her 
 i hope no one ever has to go through what i went through 
 bullying sucks 
 thanks for <unk> my car on holiday and insurance arranged for a rental to get home 
 that was the limit of the insurance cover <unk> im a <unk> and i always assumed i could use the wife 's car 
 unfortunatly that was in for a major service <unk> for whilst we we were away 
 total bummer 
 so i asked to extend the hire for a week self pay 
 no problems week went by and the rental car was picked up from home 
 then the rental company billed me to fill the tank <unk> 3 <unk> of <unk> 
 plus $ 50 <unk> 
 *i lived within <unk> of a gas station 
 * i phoned the hire car company but they completly <unk> my <unk> the charge 
 their word against mine '' 
 full means full '' 
 total stonewall 
 even started to mention that if i wanted to take it any further that i should get my lawyer to write to their lawyers 
 i phoned the insurance company went over the story and explained that the only way i could have had a <unk> tank was if they had picked it up at the gas pump itself 
 the operative called over a manager and they <unk> got very <unk> 
 further managers were called and a copy of my bill for 3 litres was requested 
 insurance company phoned back a week later and said the charge had been dropped 
 also because of my phone call their accountants had gone back over a year 's worth of using that hire company and were currently in dispute over many <unk> $ * worth of <unk> that <unk> we ca n't mention that may or may not be related to your complaint '' so not directly my <unk> but certainly a good level of smug satisfaction hire car company 
 <unk> my wrath 
 *tl dr : fuck boy is a fuck boy and makes my job a lot harder when i <unk> on him 
 sexually assaults a girl gets fucked up gets fired goes to jail 
 titties 
 so i am a bouncer 
 proof : username 
 backstory : a few months ago we hired this dude 
 we all call him ralph because he has a tattoo of the ralph <unk> horse on his chest where the logo would be on a shirt 
 this dude is a fuck boy 
 he got cut from every single fraternity in rush because he sold drugs and was <unk> with girls 
 even the douche bag fraternity that i 've written about in my previous stories said nah man you 're a fucking dick '' 
 he also got kicked off the <unk> squad because he always started fights 
 ralph is the kind of guy at a party that wo n't shut the fuck up about how he used to fight <unk> and how many hot girls he 's fucked 
 now all of this i can deal with 
 i do n't give a shit what you do on your own time as long as you do your job at work and do n't make my life harder 
 ralph did n't do his job and that 's what pissed me off 
 when we were supposed to be watching the crowd he would <unk> off to go dance with girls or get drunk in the bathroom 
 so it would be me and just one other guy managing almost 600 people 
 he would never break up fights or pull beers from underage kids 
 i would come back in from breaking up a fight and asked him why he did n't jump in and he would brush me off with a fuck you '' 
 he was literally useless 
 to add the icing on the cake he would constantly be bitching about not getting paid enough and he would rat anyone else out that complained 
 he made my job <unk> harder 
 after complaining to the managers to get him to do something else and nothing happening i had about had enough of ralph 
 what happened : i was working the floor when ralph was off 
 ralph came in blacked the fuck out 
 now remember when i said ralph was rough with women 
 well he was a bit too rough this night with the wrong group of girls 
 where i work there are a lot of <unk> that go to the local college 
 most of them come to play sports 
 a frequent group that came into the bar was the women 's volleyball team 
 i 'm a big dude i was an offensive lineman in college and a champion powerlifter 
 these girls <unk> me 
 they 're all around 6'7 and above with the most <unk> legs i 've ever seen on women 
 plus they 're all from like germany and <unk> and those european countries where they <unk> and eat bricks while still remaining attractive 
 well ralph decided one night that he wanted to climb those legs whether they wanted him to or not 
 i watched him from across the bar 
 he stumbled his way over to the group of <unk> and started talking them up 
 from the get go they were not interested 
 he would n't take no for an answer though 
 he was starting to get a little grabby and i started to <unk> over there to tell him to fuck off when it happened 
 ralph had struck out with all of his other tactics so all of the sudden he reaches under this girl 's dress and grabs her crotch 
 he <unk> her hard 
 before i could move this girl delivers an elbow to <unk> face that would make the rock do a double take 
 as ralph grabbed his nose and yelled the girl started yelling something in german at her friends and holding her private area 
 it was like watching the discovery <unk> 
 and i always root for the <unk> 
 this team of beautiful <unk> women <unk> upon ralph 
 they were fucking livid 
 they started beating the shit out of ralph 
 and at that moment i remembered that i was little <unk> from leg day so i took my sweet ass time walking over there 
 it was n't more than a few seconds but it was enough 
 when i broke up the fight ralph had a clearly broken nose claw marks on his face and neck his shirt was ripped in half and he was covered in mud 
 now what i could 've done was taken him out the side cleaned him up and gotten him a ride home 
 those girls fucked him up and he got his just <unk> 
 but i remembered how hard he had made my job for months by not doing his share 
 i picked him up and paraded his ass through the bar and straight to the cop on duty outside 
 i explained to the officer that ralph had sexually assaulted a girl inside and she reacted in self defense 
 my boss came running up and i explained to him what happened and he fired ralph on the spot 
 ralph got taken to jail and the girl whose <unk> he grabbed is pressing charges against him 
 that 's what you get for being a fuck boy ralph 
 you should n't make your coworker 's jobs harder and tell them to fuck off 
 i did n't appreciate <unk> happened a long time ago when i worked on cruise ships 
 we always had dick heads from the internet forum cruise critic '' 
 this guy had printed a sign i am a cruise critic '' and put it on his cabin door 
 basically these people expect special service and complain about absolutely everything to get free upgrades drinks or even a free cruise 
 as soon as he got on board he complained about his cabin and was upgraded to a balcony suite to shut him up 
 it still was n't good enough 
 he kept complaining that his tv reception was n't crystal clear 
 we visited his cabin and saw no issue with the image in fact it was better than most <unk> as it was close to the <unk> for that section 
 after replacing the tv anyway & amp explaining that we are tracking a <unk> tv satellite on a moving ship with a <unk> <unk> dish and millions of dollars of above and below decks equipment he still kept complaining that the picture was n't as clear as his tv at home 
 after 48 hours of him complaining and demanding a <unk> cruise he was already cruising for free after complaining so much about his last cruise we planned our revenge 
 when we knew he was at his allocated dining time my av team showed up in the cabin & amp gathered a team of engineers <unk> and <unk> 
 we stripped all of the wall & amp roof panels and pulled out all the av wiring dumping a <unk> of dust everywhere before <unk> tools & amp calling it a day 
 after the guest & amp his wife returned after dinner and a show he called the front desk furious that his cabin had been turned into an <unk> construction site 
 it was explained to him that we listened to his demands and as such were <unk> his cabin to ensure he has crystal clear tv reception just like he asked 
 he was advised would take a few days the rest of the cruise as it is a complex job 
 he went quiet before asking to be moved to another cabin 
 he was moved to a cabin smaller than his original cabin and above the bow <unk> 
 he was not heard from again the rest of the cruise 
 edit : thanks for all the comments i have n't been on reddit for a few days so coming back to this was a surprise 
 i will do my best to reply to some of the <unk> : for all those referring to me as a he '' ... think again 
 throwaway for privacy reasons 
 i own a construction equipment dealership <unk> in excavation gear 
 the main brand i carry has dealership every 2 blocks '' to the point that there are over 800 in the lower 48 states alone 
 they do this to keep prices down because dealers have to compete with each other 
 my story starts in <unk> business was booming i was making 15 % on all new gear and selling it by the truck load 
 i was one of the largest dealers in the u.s. and i was the largest in my region 
 the factory provides us with the machine as well as accessories for it 
 as a dealer we are not allowed to sell non <unk> after market accessories if the machine itself is being financed through the factory 
 i had many complaints about the lowering quality in accessories made by the factory to the point that i was no longer comfortable putting my name anywhere near it 
 i asked a friend of mine that deals only in used <unk> where he gets all his gear and he introduced me to a factory in china 
 long story short i go visit the supplier and impressed and from that day on only use after market accessories 
 i get around the financing issue by selling all machines with no gear which means no quick <unk> buckets or hydraulic thumbs and getting that financed then the customer has to pay cash for the accessories 
 if that is an issue i have a secondary bank that will finance them just not at 0 % 
 in addition to a better quality product i now can provide a much better price 
 for example a 24 '' dig bucket would typically sell for about $ 1,500 and we would buy it for $ <unk> 
 i 'll now sell it for $ 700 and pay my man in china about $ 300 
 this of course helped me get more deals which would have gone to other dealers 
 now instead of being able to call up another dealer and take a machine in on trade if i do n't have it i can only get them from the factory meaning instead of needing to hold $ <unk> $ <unk> of inventory i was having to hold about double that 
 at one point i sell a machine in to the heart of another dealers territory non restricted i may add and the customer turns out to be the dealerships owners neighbor 
 this pisses off the other dealership to no end and he finds out where my price advantage is coming from 
 his neighbor tells him that he did n't pay for the accessories separate and he takes this as he financed it all 
 the other dealer turns me in to the factory and implies that i 've always used after market gear and that i 've always financed it through the factory neither of which are true 
 he made enough waves that the factory sent people out to inventory my lot to make sure i actually had all the machines on my lot that i claim i do and to make sure all the accessories i claim are theirs actually are 
 they audit my sales for the past 8 or 9 years of our business relationship and going through everything with a fine tooth comb 
 the kicker 
 they do n't let me use any financing they offer while they 're searching for a non <unk> <unk> on my part 
 after about 2 months of having 2 or 3 men going through all of our paperwork inspecting every signature and calling over 150 different customers i get the green light to keep selling and they leave 
 unfortunately this turns what should have been the height of the season in to one of the worst quarters i 've ever had 
 tldr i get an advantage and another dealer <unk> <unk> and messes with my <unk> 
 time for the revenge in our 2008 as you may be aware the world ended 
 dealers were getting ready to close down 
 i went from making 15 % on the new machines to making 5 % and i went from over <unk> my money on each accessory to selling them at $ 100 over cost 
 i 'm proud to say i did n't lose a single penny during this 
 i eventually had to cut back my sales staff but we never lost a cent 
 anyway dealers were trying to get rid of their inventory because they did n't want to have to pay for it when the flooring expired 
 well flooring started <unk> and the dealers did n't have networks in place to be able to sell them far enough or <unk> in place to sell them cheep enough so they were getting stuck 
 at this point i was selling everything cheep but was still selling it and still making at least $ 2,000 a sale so i did n't run out of flooring on a single item 
 once a dealer ran out of flooring and could n't pay for their gear the factory would be responsible for trucking it back to their distribution centers and then they would be stuck with all the gear 
 i struck a deal with the factory and the short version is the other dealers were now getting free extended flooring and were n't paying for their machines 
 if i needed it or could sell it they would pay my shipping expense so i could sell it 
 the other dealers were mostly fine with this because i was freeing them of hundreds of thousands of debt every month 
 well most dealers loved this 
 out of the 7 or so dealers in my area i would only take trades from 6 of them 
 that 's right i stuck the dealer that turned me in with every single item he had 
 he tried to get me to take them literally offering my thousands of dollars to do so so he would n't have to either pay the factory or lose his contract with them 
 well it came to the point that our state had about $ <unk> worth of inventory on hand across all 7 dealers 
 guess what 
 nearly half of that was all on dealer 7 and his inability to sell them and inability to pay for them cost him his contract with the factory and his dealership as a hole 
 once the started turning around i had the chance to actually buy his location building land shop etc but turned it down 
 another dealership did buy it and actually hired him on as a manager 
 after a few months though he got fired as he just could n't close a deal anymore 
 true tldr 
 fuck with me and take food off of my table i 'll destroy the business that you 've ran for decades that was founded by your father 
 edit : sorry if this is a bit hard to read it took a few drinks to be able to feel <unk> enough to post this and it 's pretty late where i am right now 
 i 'll answer any questions in the comments if it was a little <unk> is my first post in pro-revenge 
 i say that more for my own records than anything but i feel it 's a good <unk> 
 nice and neutral 
 this story starts off with me sir <unk> of the <unk> moving out of an <unk> apartment and into slum-lord 's offered <unk> 
 i found the apartment on craigslist the rent was <unk> but the <unk> looked really nice 
 the building was old : she was built in a late 19th century <unk> arts style <unk> typical of former banking towns in <unk> 
 she was also conveniently located '' next to the only regional hospital thus ensuring i 'd have ambulances going past several times an hour sirens and lights like it was the end of days 
 i now know never to rent <unk> near a hospital 
 i was very satisfied with the initial <unk> 
 the apartment had high ceilings wood floors and framed <unk> 
 it was all very nice <unk> 
 i was hooked 
 i also was in <unk> <unk> with my <unk> who was going through some sort of weird relationship induced <unk> 
 all in all having this fall in my lap as it did seemed awesome 
 i had a place a <unk> 1. top floor of a walk up but who cares 
 i could afford it etc 
 then the trouble starts 
 the building 's electrical is from <unk> none of the outlets are grounded that means two <unk> holes instead of the normal three like we use in the 21st century 
 there is also a premium on these outlets as there is only one outlet in each of the 6 rooms including the bathroom and kitchen 
 this is a huge deal because i work from home and the computer and towers draws a lot of electricity for my work 
 more than the bullshit geriatric illegal wiring could handle 
 their <unk> measures were cutting into my earnings 
 on top of it all the <unk> was actually a <unk> number 
 fuck <unk> 
 the rent was 1,100 dollars for an apartment <unk> for wilson <unk> <unk> 
 i start submitting complaints 
 the breaker box was in the basement behind a locked door only the management could get to because the whole 24 apartment building was run through one breaker box for those who know electrical you 'll see where this is going 
 this was a huge problem 
 in summer you had the option of television or fan 
 winter computer or <unk> 
 if you felt adventurous you could plug something else in or turn on a light but then the whole apartment would be <unk> into darkness and you 'd have to wait for hours and hours until it was convenient for one of those <unk> to come over and reset the breaker box in the basement 
 then they had the audacity to charge you money for the service 
 the complaints continue 
 they start getting surly 
 they start getting aggressive 
 they start showing up on the first of the month to collect in person with the maintenance guys as back up 
 they start sending me threatening letters accusing me of all sorts of insanity because i had the brass balls to call them on their scam 
 this went on for several months before i was stranded over a weekend with no electrical 
 that was the breaking point 
 i called an electrician to come and look at my house 
 he tested the outlets everything 
 he was n't impressed but this was the start 
 he told me this was basically a fire trap 
 this was <unk> <unk> as i lived on the <unk> floor of a <unk> 
 i then called the fire department who directed me to the health department 
 the health department came over and did a walk through 
 he wrote up a work order for the city wiring inspector 
 the wiring inspector came over took one look at my fuse box and wrote a work order for a replacement breaker box 
 this means the fuse box needs to be torn out replaced with a breaker box the breaker line needs to be installed in this case that meant drilling through 5 floors and laying the line since it did n't exist an expense of several several thousand dollars 
 i had a breaker box but it 's not over 
 the wiring inspector was so appalled by what he saw he requested to see the rest of the building 
 turns out that the whole building is way the fuck out of code and every single apartment needs to be renovated at the cost of a couple hundred grand 
 i then used this and sued for back rent 
 i got the whole year of my time there free since the place was so out of code and slum-lord still had to repair the building on his own dime 
 tl dr they did n't deal with me so they dealt with the state 
 i won though 
 edit : after reading through some of the comments i 've found i was n't completely clear 
 no i do not live there anymore 
 edit ii : i got about 800 dollars in back rent which is equal to about 10 % of my rent a month but then the courts also voided the rent i payed him for my time there so it was a year + $ <unk> 
 so at the end of the day the 800 went back to my lawyer basically and i got the year for free 
 edit iii : yes i got payed 
 <unk> a year ago i finally decided to get out on my own for good and true because living with other people causes me <unk> stress but the only way to get into a place quickly was to take a unit on the edge of the <unk> district of town 
 i figured since there was a police station literally across the road i would be safe 
 needless to say i do n't live there any more 
 at first everything seemed fine 
 i got all my stuff moved in started learning how to cook stuff more complicated than chicken <unk> it was all good 
 most everyone in my row of units tended to keep themselves to themselves 
 apart from my neighbour on one side having noisy shower sex at two in the morning everyone left me alone 
 except this one dude 
 he was in the unit on the other side from the shower sex people and he was in retrospect way too <unk> to have a single lady moving in next door 
 he was constantly coming over just to <unk> hi and <unk> how i was <unk> in and often had to be physically pushed out the door 
 he often stank of booze and took advantage of the summer weather and sealed windows no shit this place had locked windows and tenants did n't get keys to them to come wandering in when i was working 
 he drove me nuts but seemed relatively harmless 
 the first sign that something <unk> than the guy being completely unable to get the message to fuck off and leave me alone was when the cops came around to try and serve a warrant on him 
 i do n't know exactly what came of that but he swore blind they 'd actually been after the previous tenant and he had n't come out because he was sleeping 
 which in retrospect i was a fucking idiot for believing because i am a heavy sleeper and they woke <unk> up 
 then he asked if he could use my computer to check his email because his was <unk> the shop 
 i let him because it got him to shut up and let me work faster 
 i did n't think much of this until one night when he and the guy from the unit on the other side of him got a bit drunk and came over asking to watch top gear 
 the other guy was very nice and friendly even drunk but he got louder and more and more <unk> until he crossed the line and made some jokes about raping the other guy 
 i told him not to make those jokes and to get out and while he was leaving i heard the words i 'm not fucking joking i 'll rape him if he does n't shut the fuck up '' 
 next day i spoke to the other dude and found out his computer had been confiscated by the police 
 the neighbour then promptly disappeared for a month and i had the real estate agents asking me if i had any idea where he 'd gone and why he was n't paying rent 
 he then promptly <unk> paid his owing rent and went around <unk> that he 'd had so many parking tickets they 'd arrested him 
 i do n't know much about the law but i know you do n't get a month in jail here for tickets 
 i still would have let it pass except i came down with the <unk> flu and was very very very sick for a week and every time the neighbour turned up i had to tell him to go away 
 this week was also the week a <unk> hit upstate and the heavy <unk> caused a lot of property damage all over our city and between the noise and the flu i did n't get more then about ten minutes sleep for the entire week 
 the neighbour turned up at 11pm one night demanding to let me in and in my miserable sick <unk> state i told him to fuck right off 
 the next day the seat and tyres of my motorcycle were cut to ribbons 
 even though the police and i both knew damn well who did it without any physical evidence or a witness they could n't actually do anything 
 revenge was now going to be mine 
 first i let neighbour use my computer again 
 he had a habit of not signing out of his email so instead of doing what i usually did and signing out for him i left him logged in and called an old school friend 
 said school friend is now a cop 
 i explained the situation to him and as soon as i named names he told me to stay logged in and he 'd be right over 
 two hours later my computer was being <unk> by a police department technician who downloaded pretty much everything the guy had ever written to anyone 
 i did n't see much but what i did see was fucking sick 
 i then gave statements to a few officers and found out that when neighbour was in jail for <unk> tickets he was actually in trouble for <unk> and trying to sexually assault a girl in a local bar and had only gotten out because his mum had posted bail despite him being a registered sex offender 
 the prison he 'd been in did n't even have a low security wing 
 he 'd obviously lied to the real estate agents about what was actually going on because any criminal record beyond parking or speeding tickets made them reject you for rental 
 neighbour was arrested again for something they 'd wanted to pin on him but had n't been able to until they got the emails i got <unk> as a witness and he got <unk> off to <unk> trial 
 and then just to add insult to injury my <unk> friend called the real estate agents about his record and he got evicted 
 i saw him in court last week when i gave my testimony and he lost his shit when he realised i was the one who 'd finally gotten the police the evidence they needed to send him down 
 i then got the glorious pleasure of hearing him sentenced to ten years 
 tl dr : criminal neighbour knifes my motorbike when i wo n't let him visit at 11pm i give police access to his email and he gets arrested and loses everything 
 edit : i ran into the lawyer who was <unk> the case just now at the shops looks like the jerk 's getting deported back to his home country to serve his term there 
 hah 
 that 's fucking beautiful 
 edit 2 : the <unk> did n't tell me where he 's being deported to because it 's actually against the law for him to reveal most case details however judging by the <unk> bastard 's accent he 's gon na be freezing his bollocks off somewhere <unk> 
 ouch 
 <unk> in advance for <unk> in my senior year of college only a year ago i was required to take a <unk> class for my major 
 i was n't interested in jewish studies asian literature or anything else that they offered 
 my girlfriend had taken a sociology class which qualified called <unk> 325 sociology of gender '' 
 she said it was really interesting and not at all what a stereotypical womans studies class might be like 
 so i thought what the heck i 'll give it a shot 
 unfortunately the thought <unk> discussion <unk> professor that she had was not the same one that i would be having 
 <unk> to me there were two different professors and i was in the section with the awful one 
 this professor had an agenda and made damn sure that anyone in her class would have to agree or get out 
 any <unk> was <unk> 
 over the course of the semester it was very clear that despite the class being about a very thought <unk> subject in which there are many different theories and ideas to her there was a right answer and a wrong answer to every question that may come up 
 i love playing devil 's advocate so whenever there is a <unk> in someone 's argument even if i agree with the argument i 'll speak up and try to get whoever is making the argument prove their point i was a criminal justice major beyond a reasonable doubt '' was my standard to get me to agree with you one way or another 
 so we butted heads a lot 
 it came to a head when we read <unk> from *the <unk> of the vaginal <unk> by <unk> koedt a classic feminist novel in which she among other things claims that woman are <unk> into thinking that sex is <unk> sex is pleasurable when in fact it doesnt do anything for them and ca n't feel any stimulation when <unk> 
 when i read this i laughed out loud 
 it just sounds like such bullshit that i couldnt believe we were taking it seriously 
 the author does make some good points in the book such as <unk> some <unk> <unk> but that <unk> was laughable to me 
 when it came time to discuss it in class i brought this up as total bs 
 i wish i had written it down at the time because the back and forth was pure gold 
 i raised the point that another of our readings raised the point that some woman can and some woman cant orgasm from pure vaginal stimulation 
 koedt might have been one who couldnt and since she was a <unk> not a researcher her views may have been skewed along those lines 
 my professor was arguing that koedt was right and we had been assigned the other reading a study by <unk> <unk> an early sex researcher to prove that these other woman had adopted the ideology of the <unk> society 
 if that was the case i said how can my girlfriend of 4 years have an orgasm when we have sex and her <unk> isnt being <unk> 
 obviously it was because she had adopted the ideology as well so that you could continue to have sex with her 
 so she was faking it 
 yes 
 even though i know she wasnt 
 she was lying to <unk> your ego 
 so disregarding the fact that she had just called my girlfriend a liar i brought up the point that <unk> use <unk> on each other for sex as well 
 if they couldnt feel pleasure from that then what was the point 
 and on that note apparently i was going too far down the smut train though she was perfectly happy talking about sex before and she changed the subject 
 i think making a well thought out argument against her personal beliefs made me a marked man in her book and she was determined to see me fail no matter what 
 luckily in this class we only had three grades the whole year 
 a midterm 25 % of the grade a final 40 % of the grade and a final paper 35 % 
 the two tests were both multiple choice and she could n't <unk> my grade on them one way or the other 
 i did ok on them a c and a b and just needed a 70 % on the final paper to pass the class 
 the paper 's prompt was very open ended basically any kind of gender studies research paper so i decided to poke the bear 
 not the best idea on my part but i decided to create a survey asking girls if they could have a vaginal orgasm along with some other questions about sexuality and feminist sexuality theory 
 from the research i concluded that koedt was wrong the <unk> experiment we read was outdated and wrong and that females could in fact have a vaginal orgasm 
 alert the media 
 call a news conference 
 i had <unk> my survey and <unk> in a very <unk> significant way and had <unk> of prior research to support my claims 
 despite all of this my professor gave me a 60 % on the paper on the basis that my survey had a bias the research was <unk> and my conclusions were improper for the data collected 
 she wouldnt budge despite another professor who i had asked for help in <unk> the survey speaking on my behalf 
 so the grade stayed and i failed the class 
 luckily in my university there was a process to appeal a final grade 
 what happens is that the original paper or test is submitted to a panel of other professors in the department and they all grade it separately and if the new average is very different from the original than it can be changed 
 the comments are also submitted along with testimony from myself anyone i want to have there and the professor and anyone she wants to have there 
 so the board found that my paper was very well structured and i had effectively <unk> koedt 's claims 
 they also agreed with my conclusion that the other study we looked at was outdated they were sociology professors too and knew all about the subject 
 so after the professor who i had helping me talked to them and i talked to them my professor talked to them 
 the grade was changed i got an a on the final and a b in the class 
 thank god no more gender studies for me 
 the next semester before i was going to graduate i went to see the professor who had helped me 
 he had written a great recommendation for grad school and i had gotten into my first choice and went to thank him 
 in the course of our discussion i brought up the other professor who we had shut down and he gave me some great news 
 because the board had felt she graded me extremely <unk> and on the basis of her own personal beliefs they submitted the case to the dean of the college of <unk> <unk> 
 it was not the first time that she had had complaints against her and now with this hard evidence along with the findings of the other professors she was fired 
 i had a big problem with her because <unk> should be <unk> and discussion is healthy 
 the my way or the highway '' attitude is really bad especially for the gray area of gender studies 
 so while getting someone fired isnt really something to celebrate i was glad that no more students would be subjected to her bullshit 
 **the happy : ** years ago i used to be married to <unk> <unk> 
 for the purposes of <unk> we shall call her alice 
 somewhat significant age gap when we got married : i was 27 and alice was 19 at the time 
 we had our share of ups and downs and during one particularly hard time about a year after we got married we were sunk in credit card debt and had to move in with her mother who had a whole bunch of chronic medical problems and no insurance 
 stepdad is a <unk> mechanic who was not bad at it actually but could n't get regular work because he had medical problems all his own 
 move in cut some costs help family 
 it 's the right thing to do right 
 problem was alice and i could n't seem to both hold jobs at the same time 
 she would get laid off a week before i would start a new job and <unk> 
 after about 9 months of this i was like fuck it <unk> get all the jobs 
 i get a job working <unk> 
 i get a weekend job 
 the temp service i signed up with was really aggressive and got me decent <unk> jobs on a regular basis 
 only problem was these jobs were over an hour away from her mom 's and i 'd be so dead tired from working i 'd crash at my brother 's place which was 10 minutes away the next city over 
 i 'd only be able to go home to see alice every few days then have to get up a few hours later so i could beat the rush hour in to work 
 four months pass and we find ourselves slowly inching from the red into the black 
 one day alice lets me know that she got a job 
 it 's about 20 minutes away and only i have a working car 
 she has friends that can give her a ride when i 'm not home and i take her to work or pick her up every chance i get 
 this goes on for about a month 
 finally she says i think i need my own car '' 
 it 's all good she 's an independent girl and i can see how hard it is for her to be so <unk> on other people 
 i do some quick math and figure it would take about four months for us to get enough money together to get a decent beater that wo n't die in a year 
 she nods her understanding 
 i see her disappointment and my man-pride can not take it 
 i level up and go beast mode 
 i start taking side jobs mostly construction with a friend of a friend who pays on a <unk> basis to fill out the times when i have <unk> on weekdays when the temp agency has n't got anything for me and i pull double shifts for the weekend job 
 i sleep an average of four or five hours a day 
 three weeks later i have purchased a car for her a cute little <unk> that i saw on craigslist 
 <unk> sound but was dirty af 
 i park it at a friend 's place and over the course of a week give that grimy bastard the most <unk> cleaning of its life 
 you could have eaten off the wheel wells i shit you not 
 my good buddy nathan <unk> for some cheap but nice <unk> wheel paint seat covers floor mats etc 
 and we make it look even better 
 when we move it out of the garage my friend 's mom swears it <unk> be the same car and i have to prove it to her 
 i leave my car with nathan and drive home in her car 
 timing is perfect 
 i 'm about 10 minutes away from home when alice calls me on my cell 
 she wants to go get some groceries 
 i let her know i 'll be there in a bit and park by the curb one house down 
 i knock on the door and tell her to come out so we can go 
 she steps out and looks around 
 where 's your car '' 
 left it at nathan 's '' 
 what did you drive '' 
 that '' 
 i point at the car 
 whose car is that '' 
 yours '' 
 she takes a couple of seconds to process that single word 
 then her jaw drops and alice runs back inside screaming mom <unk> got me a car '' 
 **the sad : ** a couple of years go by 
 alice has learned how to use a manual transmission because her baby has one 
 between myself and her stepdad alice has learned to change the oil herself and even took an active part in replacing the brake pads and all four shock <unk> on her baby 
 she <unk> her baby herself 
 she has learned to take care of her baby 
 mil 's medical problems are mostly manageable with meds now and stepdad is getting almost regular work thrown his way by friends and previous customers 
 we have moved out of her mom 's place and i 'm only working two jobs now 
 credit card debt is down by 80 % 
 alice also has a steady job and is thinking of going back to school 
 and then i find out she is cheating on me 
 fool me once shame on you 
 fool me twice shame on me 
 there is no third time 
 there must be payback 
 my man-pride demands it 
 **the mad : ** a week after the nuke drops on our marriage i 've worked out the problem 
 she 's already gotten her stuff and moved out by then 
 i call her up to meet 
 lunchtime her work 
 just to talk i say 
 there 's a little <unk> <unk> area right by the building she works at and there 's a fair amount of foot traffic ie witnesses 
 there 's some chitchat and she makes a vague appeal to work things out by dragging my dead dad into it 
 <unk> <unk> 
 you do n't have the right to do that 
 you had a one percent chance but that just flat out dropped it to zero 
 i cut her off mid-sentence 
 i 'm taking the car 
 your car '' 
 wut '' 
 the pink slip is in my name 
 i 'm taking back my property right now 
 and if you do n't hand over the keys right now i 'm going to report it stolen to the police '' 
 but you gave that car to *me* '' 
 i 'd been talking in a normal <unk> tone up until this time 
 her betrayal <unk> into my chest for the <unk> time 
 my voice <unk> 
 i did n't give the car to you 
 **i gave the car to <unk> <unk> 
 ** '' her brain still is n't firing on all <unk> 
 she asks <unk> how will i get to work '' 
 get your boyfriend to drive you '' 
 i 'm still looking at her 
 her face goes slack as she realizes that i am 
 not 
 kidding 
 i take the keys get into the her baby and drive off 
 i look at her as we pass 
 she still has the same look on her face 
 and i drive all the way home with the biggest shit-eating grin on mine 
 **tl dr** - i buy my wife a car 
 she cheats on me 
 we break up 
 i take the car back 
 p.s 
 - goddamn that was cathartic 
 this is the best i 've felt in over a decade 
 <unk> 
 - car stuck around for another year before i sold it to my buddy nathan 
 i only wanted $ 100 for it and he wanted to pay blue book 
 we <unk> i sold it for the same price i bought it 
 which was way cheaper than blue book 
 <unk> - thanks for the gold anonymous redditor 
 edit - as suggested did some name changing to make it flow better 
 also not their real names 
 there 's always that one person 
 a little back story first 
 my older brother adopted me when i was 14 i lived with him his wife and her two children one a couple months older than me the other a year older 
 i have never gotten along with the younger one his mother and father went through a divorce and both parents spoiled the hell out of him 
 his father owned several businesses making around a million a year so he 's your typical entitled douchebag who has always <unk> with me someone who grew up poor 
 this is the type of dude that kicked a dog we all raised from a 4 week old puppy because she was excited to see him after not seeing him for six months and she was jumping around 
 he 's the type of dude that has ruined thanksgiving because the milk was 2 % instead of 1 % by screaming yelling and cussing everyone out at the age of <unk> now on to the story : i was on a phone plan with his mother but i lost my job unable to pay the last $ 60 i owe her but we had worked it out that i would pay her back on thanksgiving by installing a stereo my brother 's her husbands new pickup 
 a little over a week ago i was picking up fallout 4 for a friend who was at work at the <unk> in the local mall nephew works across the little walkway and saw me walk in from outside where he was walking in to work 
 while i 'm in line he comes in cuts in front of everyone and <unk> me out saying i should n't be buying games when i owe his mom money 
 i told him he needed to back the hell off and not talk about shit he knew nothing about 
 he kept going on and on running his mouth 
 i got my friends game and walked out with him following me out the door 
 when i got to the door he stopped ranting and went back to work with a smug look on his face 
 i lived with this guy for years so i know him very well 
 when i hopped in my car i realized he had parked in front of me and my dash cam was on 
 he sells weed out of his truck to <unk> his low wages at the mall and i remembered that he always showed up to work early to so 
 i <unk> my dash cam and sure enough you could clearly see him sell weed 
 i sent an email with the video of him selling the weed to the management of the mall from a new email address as a concerned citizen '' 
 three days later while talking to my brother he told me that my nephew got fired from his job and banned from the mall property 
 my response that sucks '' 
 enjoy not getting that unemployment check asshole 
 edit : just a bit of a preface besides the landlord trying to <unk> me he also sent me emails prior to the court date saying that i have no chance of winning and should settle for under 50 % of the total cost 
 claims he has never lost in court 
 waited in the court lobby for nearly two hours 
 landlord sat <unk> to me and kept trying to make stupid <unk> talk with me 
 i ignored him completely 
 finally get pulled into the court room after the office was supposed to have closed about 4:00pm 
 the judge asks if there is anything she can do to help us reach an <unk> settlement without having to go through the <unk> process 
 i explain that i attempted that before any court proceedings and landlord would not accept my offer 
 his <unk> was <unk> low 
 unfortunately we have to do the thing 
 we are sworn in 
 judge asks for a copy of the lease 
 she reads off the monthly rent amount then the security deposit amount 
 asks me when i sent it to landlord originally i tell her around july 4th <unk> landlord confirms to her that he received it 
 judge asks landlord what he did with the security deposit 
 i deposited it '' he says 
 judge explains that she needs details 
 what financial institution type of account etc 
 i just deposited it into my wells <unk> or whatever he said account '' 
 judge lets out an audible sigh 
 mr. tenant where you told what financial institution this was deposited in 
 i explain that i was never informed 
 another audible sigh 
 judge asks if she can speak with each of us separately 
 we agree landlord goes first 
 about ten minutes later they return and i go with the judge 
 i 'm ready to explain all of the claims he made as to why he was keeping the money show her all of the evidence i 've documented and brought with me brought 3 <unk> each with their own copies of various things 
 judge closes the door to her office and explains that he is going to give me the entirety of the deposit 
 she explains that since he never <unk> the location of the deposit or put it in an interest bearing account he essentially had no case 
 she explains that the **pennsylvania** landlord-tenant act of 1951 is very specific and the landlord has a lot of things he needs to follow 
 i ask if that means he will also be paying for the court fees about $ <unk> 
 she tells me that i can request that but since this will technically be a <unk> she was being nice and not putting in a judgment against him but he still had to pay the full amount she did n't ask him about that 
 i suggest that he pay half as a sign of good faith and also i wanted this shit to be done with 
 she thinks this is very reasonable 
 we go back into the court room and she explains that landlord has agreed to pay the full amount and also informs him that he will be paying half of the court fees 
 the judge asks how long i 'd like to give him 
 she suggests 3 business days 
 i offer a full week because i 'm way too fucking nice 
 landlord offers to write the check right then and there 
 he does 
 i receive the check and i return to him the <unk> check he originally tried to return me less than 25 % of the initial deposit 
 in my final moments of glory the judge again suggests to landlord that he read up on the **pennsylvania** landlord-tenant act of 1951 as being a landlord is n't something you should <unk> 
 i pipe up and explain to him that i had already done him the favor and pull out the entire agreement which i had already printed up and highlighted the relevant sections 
 i tell him he can keep it as i 've already read it 
 the judge says we are free to go 
 today was a good <unk> reading the news this morning about how cheating is <unk> in india it brought back a memory of my time in college ... our story begins in a little school called <unk> in upstate new york about 5-6 years ago 
 state run school that they tried to <unk> as an <unk> '' of technology 
 this was a school that only had wireless in one building out of six had it equipment from as far back as <unk> according to the <unk> and professors who were <unk> <unk> or in my case <unk> 
 i was in what was called an <unk> course '' which meant it would count towards my degree but would be <unk> 
 we were required to take at least four of these 493 '' classes over the course of our attendance in order to graduate 
 it was bullshit but that was the rule 
 one of these classes was run by an elderly professor who was known for being <unk> <unk> and literally a relic of the past 
 he constantly claimed he '' <unk> token ring and how it was superior to ethernet in almost every way 
 every exam had a token ring related question and the only way to get a perfect score on that question was to <unk> academic <unk> and <unk> that token ring was superior in that <unk> because ... whatever 
 very <unk> if you get me 
 now the class itself was a mix of foreign graduate students from india and undergrad students from new york 
 we were typically assigned group work and the six of us from ny would work together turn in our papers the usual ... and the graduate students would do the same 
 for the final project the professor decided that the <unk> could learn better if they worked at the graduate level so the normal teams were split up and i was put on a team of all indian graduate students 
 we were given 6 weeks to <unk> a product and apply previous course work and knowledge into making the product more <unk> 
 an example would be a lawnmower that you could control via a cell phone 
 we could simply say it was a lawnmower but we 'd have to explain in detail the <unk> used over the network <unk> error control how it would handle signal degradation etc 
 very challenging and yet a great way to show off what i 've learned so far 
 furthermore we 'd all have to grade each other in <unk> forms and get the other teammates to sign off on it 
 so if you wanted to give someone a c you 'd have to explain to them why you graded them that way 
 i was not a fan of this as i felt it was the professors job to grade us not our fellow students 
 he was <unk> his duties but the chair of the department was new and did n't want to mess with a <unk> teacher 
 this was the hand i was dealt 
 the first meeting my team had was lacking to say the least 
 the graduate students contributed nothing 
 one of them worked on a paper from another class and the other two were just <unk> 
 any idea i had they instantly approved of 
 felt good the first few times but as time went on it became apparent i was the only one doing the work 
 this pattern continued into week two and three and i finally said i could n't make it anymore due to scheduling <unk> and we 'd <unk> online via email 
 of course the grad students thought this was a great idea and we did n't meet in person again except in class as <unk> by the professor 
 by week four i had done what i felt was my part of the work 
 i 'd written eight pages of content describing how the product would work it 's practical purposes how it 'd communicate over <unk> etc 
 the only thing i could n't get my head wrapped around was the high level stuff like error correction signal drift and that sort of thing 
 math was never my strong point but the grad students said it would be no problem 
 i thanked them told them exactly what needed to be done and even highlighted the important parts of the paper for them 
 at most they 'd have to write one page each to <unk> my eight 
 they were getting a pretty sweet deal and i was going to get to graduate 
 win win i thought 
 week five comes around and i 'm expecting the email with the completed paper 
 there was n't a whole lot of email traffic ... none to be exact for the past week 
 in send out an email asking for a status update since the paper is due next week and we 'll all fail if we miss the deadline 
 the final paper <unk> 40 % of the final grade 
 i get an email 2 days before deadline that we all need to meet in the library to finish the paper and they 've been really busy with other coursework 
 at this point i 'm more nervous than angry as my ass is on the line and ca n't afford to fail a class and miss graduation 
 we decide on a time reserve a room and meet 
 they had literally **nothing** to show for the past five weeks 
 i know people on reddit <unk> the word literally '' a lot but i ca n't <unk> this enough 
 **nothing** 
 i explained the situation we were *all* in and how we 'd all fail if we blew this but they were cocky and sure that he 'd never fail them and they 've had him before etc etc etc 
 excuses 
 they wanted me to bet my degree on excuses and <unk> that was backed by nothing 
 after the meeting i went to meet with the professor 
 at this point i 'm more scared than anything else 
 too scared to be angry but it was still there and incredibly nervous that the old man was n't going to budge 
 sure enough ... he did n't 
 i explained my case showed him all the work i did described every aspect of the project to him verbally to prove i made a full and honest attempt to get this done but my teammates were holding me back 
 80 % of the time he did n't even look at me 
 just kept repeating that this is what the real work world is like and this sort of thing will happen in real life and i need to find a way through it '' and all other sorts of useless guidance 
 in effect i wasted at least an hour of my life in his office 
 the dept chair had an office in the same hallway a few doors down 
 having no other options i just sat down in the hallway against the door waiting for him 
 people would pass by and look at me some would smile most did n't 
 a college student sitting against an office door in a hallway <unk> of desperation and <unk> ... which <unk> up the entire college very nicely in retrospect 
 after what feels like forever the department chair arrives lets me in and says i have <unk> before he has an appointment downstairs so make it brief '' 
 i gathered my thoughts and made the same case i made to the professor how i was being sabotaged by my teammates and the professor refused to hear me out 
 at one point i challenged the chair about why i 'm not going to be graded on my <unk> and knowledge but rather who i was associated with <unk> to begin with 
 finally he had to <unk> me from his office to get to his meeting but told me he 'd look into this '' and shook my hand 
 no <unk> no promises just a handshake 
 -- <unk> -- - the different teams present their products and the professor does his <unk> in a way that makes the <unk> of reddit seem like <unk> <unk> 
 he used his <unk> years of experience to effectively shoot down everyone on every team in any area they felt they <unk> covered 
 <unk> situations and <unk> of costs and scale that turned what was at first a fun project of <unk> with field specific knowledge into what can only be described as technical draft reading in front of a <unk> firing squad 
 then the dreaded moment arrives when my team has to present 
 we get to the front of the class and know what 's coming our way 
 my seated classmates all had the look of <unk> and defeat on their faces and i knew i 'd soon be one of them 
 at this school you got used to being beaten 
 to give you all the scene : i 'm a <unk> '' skinny white kid next to four 6 tall indians who each had at least <unk> on me ... so i 'm the <unk> of the litter up there 
 i pull out my 8 pages and start reading 
 do n't even get off the first page before the professor starts poking holes in individual statements 
 i politely asked him to hold all questions until the end so i would n't lose my place on the paper and because i hoped he 'd forget most of them by the end ... which he agreed to and smiled 
 then he walked up to his desk got a pad of paper and a pen sat back down and told me to continue 
 i smiled at him because it 's all i could do in that moment of defeat 
 instead of taking small beatings along the way i was gon na get fucking destroyed by a <unk> at the end 
 jumping out the window looked like a good option at this point second floor so i 'd live and probably be able to <unk> off with a <unk> 
 by the time i got to the end of page eight he was on page three 
 my classmates had looks of fear and shock when they saw him turning over page after page to jot down notes and questions 
 for an old bastard he was meticulous i 'll give him that 
 so i get to the end and i ask him if he had any questions he 'd like to ask **the <unk> 
 at this point i was the only one who had said a word so it was high fucking time my other teammates chimed in to help 
 his questions were just as sharp and pointed as the ones he asked other teams 
 very advanced and frankly beyond my level 
 after he 'd read a question i 'd call out one of the others and say that 's an <unk> point you made sir i 'll let $ teammate explain that part of the product and hope it 'll answer your question '' 
 i handed my pages to the teammate and let fate take it 's course 
 now we 've all come across people who <unk> they 're great at bullshitting but really are n't 
 you let them dig a hole for a while then fill it in with them at the bottom 
 the professor did exactly that 
 he set them up gave them a length then yanked the leash back and called them out on their misunderstanding of the topic or the product or the part of the course that explained it 
 each question i directed to another teammate one after another 
 number three tried to pass '' but that just <unk> the professor which made him even worse 
 he started calling out those four graduate students asking them to describe certain parts of the product ... which is what he was writing down on his pad of paper the entire time not just questions 
 number four tried <unk> answers and <unk> tactics which again just <unk> the professor 
 at the end he threw us out of the class 
 i 'll never forget that ... he went on a <unk> tirade of how we treated our final project like a joke it was the worst presentation he 'd ever seen in his history at the school and how we should all be ashamed of ourselves if this was our best effort 
 i was already sweating bullets from fear and anxiety and after that speech i was glad to be the first one out the door 
 skipped my other classes went back to the dorm locked myself in my room and went to bed at 3pm 
 did n't know what else to do and i was mentally exhausted ... that kind of exhausted where your brain just goes into <unk> because you ca n't figure a way out of a mess that you should n't have been in in the first place 
 did n't leave the dorm the next day nor eat for the <unk> did n't even want to drink as i knew that 'd make the depression worse 
 i 'd have plenty of time for drinking after telling my parents i was n't graduating 
 two days after the presentation i got an email from the professor asking for a meeting in room 123 where room 123 was the chair 's office 
 i accepted and arrived <unk> early with both the professor and the chair already inside 
 we started early and got right to the point with the professor looking right at me and asking what happened here '' 
 as he pointed to my <unk> report on the desk 
 i explained it as best i could the product the function the technology used ... and then he stopped me 
 he did n't care about that he wanted to know why i was the only one on the team who had an idea of what the presentation was about 
 the chair asked if i had bothered working with my teammates at all since they apparently seemed clueless about what i was <unk> about 
 naturally i denied the claim opening my sent emails folder on my laptop to show all the times i reached out to them and how <unk> they replied 
 i told him about the in-person meetings in the beginning and how i only found out two days before the deadline that they were n't doing anything to contribute 
 i gently reminded them both that i was in their offices as soon as i found out where this was all heading but i admitted that i should have kept a better track of their progress 
 i learned a long time ago that a little <unk> and admitting your own <unk> no matter how small goes a long way 
 the chair let out a huff of air through his nose and gave a look to my professor 
 i could n't tell if it was contempt or not but it made me feel <unk> more at ease 
 the last question i got asked was if the packet of papers was all my original work 
 did you write this all of this solo '' 
 to which i replied that i had except the one paragraph that i did a direct quote but cited properly at the bottom of the page 
 grades got posted the next week for all my classes 
 i did decent but knew i was fucked because the 493 class 
 the grade posted though was a b- 
 i refreshed the page several times to make sure it was n't a formatting problem with the site a common problem back then but the grade held 
 i stopped by the professors office later that day after one of other classes and asked why i got that grade 
 i explained that i had legitimately thought i had failed based on the final project 
 apparently the chair suggested that my team **not** be graded according to the previously mentioned system and be given grades directly from the professor as is normal in every other class 
 my part of the work while lacking in several areas was acceptable for an <unk> student 
 he admitted in plain english that he treats <unk> with more aggression because the world is not a nice place and it 's better you learn that lesson here where you can get back up after a fall '' 
 i told him i appreciated the hard lesson but there might be better ways of going about it 
 he did n't care and i was n't surprised he did n't either 
 turns out that i was not the only one they met with in the office 
 the graduate students were called in one at a time and were required to bring their parts of the project to the meeting 
 they all <unk> 
 they were either too stupid or too lazy to even try and hide it 
 the chair ran their papers though one of those plagiarism <unk> programs and they all came back with <unk> % <unk> 
 one of them i 'll never know who copied straight from <unk> <unk> 
 graduate students 
 he repeated his claim that it was one of the worst presentations he 'd ever seen and how it was shameful ... but this time around i knew he was referring to the graduate students and not me 
 at the end of the meeting i shook his hand not as a courtesy but out of respect 
 his teaching style was <unk> but damned if it was n't effective 
 i 'll never forget the lessons learned from that class and i do n't mean the coursework 
 as for the graduate students 
 failed each of them and 2 more that were n't in my group 
 it was a <unk> sort of thing on campus everyone in the major heard about it and it was the talk of the dining hall for a couple of days 
 because of the grades and the plagiarism hit on their record they all lost their student <unk> 
 while i ca n't be 100 % sure they were deported the plagiarism charge means they ca n't come back to the school and no other schools will touch them for at least a couple semesters 
 they ca n't get a job in the country without a valid visa either so it effectively ended them 
 my degree hangs above my desk at home and <unk> me of those hard lessons learned 
 ** -- tl dr -- ** this is a story about a <unk> senior citizen 3 indians myself a chair and a whole lot of fear 
 also - one of the hardest lessons i 've ever learned 
 no not in that way <unk> from <unk> charlie wilson entered politics as a teenager by running a campaign against his next-door neighbor city council incumbent charles hazard 
 when <unk> years old wilson 's <unk> dog entered hazard 's yard 
 hazard retaliated by mixing crushed glass into the dog 's food causing fatal internal bleeding 
 following this incident wilson obtained a driver 's permit and drove <unk> <unk> primarily black citizens from poor <unk> to the <unk> in his family 's <unk> <unk> 
 as patrons left the car wilson told each of them that he did n't want to influence their vote but that the incumbent hazard had purposely killed his dog 
 after hazard was defeated by a margin of 16 <unk> wilson went to his house to tell him he should n't poison any more dogs 
 wilson cited this as the day he fell in love with <unk> little incident happened over the course of the past few months 
 a little background : my husband and i moved to a new place and did n't know anyone there 
 he 's really <unk> and his new job was filled with people around his age so he made friends easily 
 on the other hand i 'm pretty quiet and all my coworkers are at least 20 years older than me and i 'm not into going out '' thing unlike a lot of people my age <unk> 
 so i ended up joining a <unk> website to meet people that way 
 also i 've always had more guy friends than girl friends because i connect with them better growing up with 3 brothers and no sisters will do that to you 
 so anyway i start talking to this guy named john on the website and he seems really cool 
 as i always do when first chatting with <unk> on the site i told him off the bat that i have a husband in addition to it being in the main area of my profile 
 he said that he totally understood and i believed him 
 we eventually exchanged numbers and began to text and make plans to meet up for the first time 
 before that happened though he started to change 
 he began to try and flirt with me <unk> that he thought i was attractive etc 
 i reminded him that i was being 100 % serious about not looking for anything romantic 
 for a few days he went back to normal 
 the night before we were set to meet he sent me a dick pic which was a really <unk> looking dick and said please <unk> 
 your husband does n't need to know '' 
 at that point i wrote back saying i 'm not interested and i do n't want to meet with you '' 
 within 30 seconds i get a text back saying what is wrong with you 
 followed by a blank text that just says stagefright <unk> '' 
 thankfully not only is my phone patched but the texting app i use wo n't let the video play 
 i replied and told him to leave me alone not mentioning the stagefright message at all 
 a few days passed and i heard nothing from him 
 then out of the blue i get a text from john that says please give me another chance 
 it was hard for me to believe you would n't even consider me '' 
 i told him that it was hard for me to believe that someone would be so malicious as to try and stagefright my phone all over a <unk> 
 he said sorry 
 my pride made me angry '' 
 at that point i knew i could enact my revenge 
 although i only knew his first name i was easily able to find him on facebook through his phone number giving me his last name 
 from there i was able to find everything else ... twitter instagram etc 
 i took screenshots of everything including his incriminating admission of attempting to attack my phone 
 here 's where the revenge comes in : he had previously told me that he had gotten into the school of his dreams to study a certain subject not taught at many other places ... i figured that this college would be interested to hear that one of their <unk> students was <unk> in malicious and potentially illegal activity in their free time so i rang them up 
 i left messages for multiple offices any i could think of that would relate to him 
 the following week i got a call back from the office of the dean of his program 
 they asked that i forward everything i had to them which i did 
 then i did n't hear anything for a few weeks and figured that was the end of it ... until i got a call from the dean herself 
 she told me that the school took my story very seriously and had decided to withdraw their acceptance of john 
 she said that she was happy that i came forward with what he had done because they did n't want someone whose behaviour would reflect poorly on their program 
 i thanked her for getting back to me 
 i immediately checked his twitter account 
 yep sure enough he had made a series of depressed <unk> about how his dream had been stolen from him he did n't know what to do now etc 
 i know that there are way harsher revenge stories out there but i 'm pretty proud of what i did to that <unk> told to post here from <unk> hey all 
 i used to work for a cable company in eastern canada <unk> with <unk> i finished up with them on good terms about 2 years ago and called in due to some issues with my <unk> speed being <unk> instead of the <unk> i was paying for i knew they could <unk> 80 % <unk> as was the policy this woman i got on the phone argues with me up and down keep in mind i was a supervisor before i left that they only guaranteed wireless speeds 
 i told her she was an outright liar and needed to be <unk> went over company policy and what she was supposed to be doing step by step eventually she put me on hold for 10 minutes after i requested a supervisor cause i was done dealing with her she comes back and says are you ready to speak to me like an adult now <unk> '' 
 i was pretty ticked went on facebook and contacted the 3 managers i knew from her <unk> and got them to listen in on the call and advised her of what i had just done she started apologizing profusely and was almost in tears found out later she got fired as she had been talked to numerous times about this and would not stop 
 for all you call centre reps out there that do your job you 're awesome for those of you that are <unk> at it but still do it keep it up for those of you that blatantly lie to customers to get them off the phone quicker and make them call back to pester another rep a <unk> and heartfelt fuck you 
 remember some of us used to work for you and know higher ups in your company and will report you 
 have a nice day : this happened a year or so ago when my friend was driving another friend and i around town on a typical day or whatever 
 we had just gotten a fuck ton of fast food from the drive-thru because we 're stoners and we were stopped in the left turn lane of an intersection when some dickhead in a blacked out <unk> or <unk> suv nailed the side of my friend 's car with an egg while making a right turn at that intersection 
 i did n't think much of it because i was sitting on the left side and i was n't paying much attention to detail but my friend was n't having it 
 he instantly peels out of the left turn lane and to the right where the suv had taken off 
 the driver of the suv obviously made a huge mistake thinking he could get away with this because he pulls up to the next intersection 's left turn lane giving my friend the golden opportunity to equal punishment in an equal manner 
 as my friend is making his move and he <unk> his fresh milk shake with his right hand he suddenly notices the passenger window open 
 the driver glances over to the right and even before his eyes had a chance to <unk> smack 
 the <unk> travels from window to window and broke square on the bridge of his nose and all over his blacked out interior all in the same time as my friend took off to the right at that intersection in the same cocky manner as the asshole did at the last 
 looking back through the rear window i think he had to remain stopped to process the defeat he had just been dealt 
 **tl dr** friends car gets egged by random driver friend gets immediate revenge throwing <unk> at driver 's face and all over his blacked out leather interior 
 edit : some shit bothered me about my writing so i fixed it and thanks for the feedback this is currently happening with a co-worker of mine and i think it fits here 
 **background** my co-worker r is going through a <unk> divorce with about a week to go before the custody hearing starts for their two daughters 
 both parents want full custody and seems willing to fight for it 
 a couple of weeks ago r was driving home when two guys with a <unk> pulls him over and attacks him 
 r has recently had a stroke so he installed an emergency button which he pressed before he got out of the car 
 5 minutes later two response vehicles arrives and chases the guys that <unk> him up 
 after talking '' to them for a while the truth comes out 
 his ex-wive 's lawyer hired these thugs to scare him off 
 about two weeks later r is sitting at home one evening when his ex-wive and her new <unk> come knocking on his door 
 he opens up and they drunkenly start harassing and a verbally attacking him 
 she tells him that she and her new guy works together and has been fucking long before the divorce has been finalized 
 r is understandably upset but he is a gentle guy so he just waits it out and eventually they leave 
 r is an ex flying squad member and still has a lot of contacts in the police 
 **revenge** r decided to report them to their company 's hr 
 he needs any dirt on his ex-wive for the custody battle so he tries to dig a bit 
 the hr lady tells him that the guy is married with kids and that this is not the first time something like this has happened 
 r gets the guy 's wife 's number and calls her calmly telling her about the affair and emailed her any incriminating stuff he had as proof 
 the new guy rocks up at r 's house that night drunk and aggressive 
 r has to point his gun at the new guy to get him to leave 
 <unk> for his own and his daughters safety r files a restraining order against the new guy 
 then he takes down the guy 's number plates and calls one of his old flying squad buddies to run it through the system 
 i turns out the new guy is running fake plates and now there 's a warrant out for his arrest 
 new guy and the ex-wife both got fired because their affair is against company policy 
 **tl & amp dr - guy 's ex wife and new boyfriend is harassing him 
 he decides to let their work and the guy 's wife know 
 they both get fired 
 the guy also has false number plates on his car which will lead to his arrest 
 ** **background information : ** my family is a family of three middle class and we grew up in a nice area 
 nothing too fancy nothing terrible 
 just your typical <unk> with neighborhood parks <unk> & amp schools all within walking distance 
 we were nice to our neighbors and all knew each other 
 my parents had a outdoor fire pit that they like to sit outside on the back patio and drink listen to music grill and relax outside 
 my family is very respectful of rules so the music was almost never loud we do n't throw parties and we kept mainly to ourselves but invited people over occasionally 
 when i was in <unk> grade we had some new next door neighbors move in 
 they were a family of four mom dad son daughter 
 the son was a year older than me and the daughter was a year younger than me 
 the daughter and i hit it off immediately as friends but i noticed something was off when i would go over 
 for the purpose of secrecy i will change their names let 's call them the smith 's 
 the smith 's had a weird idea of how to interact with people 
 i get it everyone is different 
 they were very blunt and open about everything never would say thank you did n't think about others 
 they just turned out to be scum of the earth when it came to treating other people with <unk> and respect 
 just weird people but i guess it takes all kinds 
 **the dogs : ** my family had a medium sized basenji that my dad had trained very well 
 when i was a junior in high school daughter smith really wanted to have a new dog 
 daughter smith basically got whatever she wanted being the younger sibling and could do no wrong 
 so mother smith got her a beautiful german <unk> 
 i 'll call the dog asshole 
 now asshole really is n't the one to blame 
 the smith 's never corrected the dog so it 's honestly no surprise that asshole never behaved 
 the dog grew up doing whatever he wanted 
 he was constantly off the leash in the front yard tried to pick fights with my dog in the back yard he was always trying to dig under the fence or in some places tried to knock the fence down 
 asshole was obsessed with running the fence line with my basenji and just trying to get to him whenever we saw him 
 they got into a few dog fights when asshole got loose but i promise it was never my dog 's fault that this 80 pound sack of fur ran into our yard and picked a fight 
 **the <unk> : ** a few years of this behavior go by and the smith 's and my family are n't friendly anymore 
 we would express to them that their dog was trying to get to our dog that the fence was in bad shape that my dad and i were constantly filling the holes under the fence that their dog had dug 
 they just did n't care 
 my family went into their own pockets to replace 3 sections of fence and just doing that pissed them off 
 by the time we are absolutely fed up with it i had gone off to university and was a sophomore 
 **the story : ** a few days before thanksgiving asshole dug yet another hole under the fence 
 since i was n't at home playing with the dog as much and my parents were <unk> on getting thanksgiving plans ready no one noticed the hole 
 the friday after thanksgiving my parents were out relaxing in the back yard the dogs were running the fence line and i was about to leave to go <unk> with some old high school friends 
 i went outside to tell my parents that i was leaving when we hear the most <unk> yelp by any animal that i have ever heard 
 asshole had dug far enough to put his head under the fence and bit the shit out of my dog 
 half of his <unk> was torn almost completely off as well as some other things that i wo n't describe 
 long story short we had to put my dog down because of it 
 now the smith 's refused to acknowledge what had happened 
 they never once said sorry never once offered to pay any part of the medical bills nothing 
 as far as they were concerned we were the dead ones not my dog 
 **the revenge : ** by this point my family is pissed and we have nothing but time on our hands 
 we devise our revenge over the course of a few months 
 it had to be <unk> and cost them time effort money and most importantly : make them feel like shit 
 first step : collect dog shit 
 i 'll come back to that later 
 second step : take them to court and get their dog classified as a dangerous dog '' 
 if you ever have the chance to look at the hoops you have to go through to keep a dangerous dog you would know it 's horrible 
 the requirements change depending on where you live but in our area the dog had to be <unk> while outside never could be off a leash pay fines has to have a special crate in their back yard which was hard for them because they had a pool random surprise inspections and if the dog has another incident the dog has to be put down 
 to be clear the goal was n't to hurt the dog 
 just make their life difficult for as long as the animal was alive 
 what was important for us us that it set up a record with the city and police department 
 we slowly convinced our neighbors to call them in on every violation that they did for months 
 park more than 18 inches off the curb 
 ticket 
 loud music past quiet hours 
 ticket 
 now i know you 're thinking that calling the cops and making them pay tickets is n't revenge and you 're right ... it was our cover 
 we started to play our music loud right up till quiet hours ever single night for three months 
 when they got fed up with it and tried to call the cops there was nothing they could do 
 we 'd politely explain that they have had a record of doing the same thing and then they would get <unk> instead 
 third step : summer rolls around and now i 'm home and working a <unk> job so all of my nights are free 
 the smith 's son was working second shift at some restaurant so he never got home until after midnight 
 during the summer in texas your car could reach <unk> to the touch in midday 
 point being even at midnight the car was hot 
 the best part was that all of the smith 's cars were parked outside 
 my mom got this idea after one of her friends got <unk> by putting <unk> in the air vents that <unk> your windows 
 we decided to step it up a notch 
 if you take frozen shrimp or fish let it thaw for a day get it nice and smelly put it in a <unk> with a crap ton of water then freeze it into ice cubes you can imagine what that smells like when it <unk> 
 one smelly freezer <unk> what we did ... worth it 
 over the course of june when anyone would check the mailbox which was perfectly placed on the other side of the smith 's house we would drop one of those nasty ice cubes into the <unk> vent of the son 's car 
 then halfway through june we started moving on to the mom 's car 
 like clockwork we would see them on weekends trying to air out their cars all day making it even easier to throw in ice cubes all summer 
 remember that dog shit i told you about 
 here 's the fourth part 
 the daughter was a big <unk> all the time 
 her parents never made her have a job so all she would do is <unk> all day and night if she was n't hanging out with friends 
 my dad came up with the idea of shit bombs '' when he bought a slingshot to shoot down <unk> <unk> 
 after doing some yard work while still having gloves he would load up that slingshot with dog shit shoot it over the fence and into their pool 
 at first it was only a couple of pieces then it grew to a few more by that point we had gotten another dog and right before their big party we unloaded the rest of the shit we had 
 the daughter and her friends were swimming for about 2 hours before they noticed the shit floating in the pool 
 the fifth step took a lot longer to accomplish : their air conditioner was right on the other side of our fence 
 you could get on your tip toes and see the unit less than five feet away 
 remember those nasty ice cubes 
 we started throwing them on top of their unit and they would melt and eventually made the house smell 
 then instead of fish in the cubes we slowly replaced them with gravel and sand 
 the sand and gravel would rattle around at night causing them to no be able to sleep between the smell and the sound 
 finally they called out an ac repair man who tried to fix it 
 the ac guy basically told them he had no idea how sand and gravel was in the unit but that it would eventually need to be replaced 
 the smith 's got suspicious and eventually put up cameras around their house 
 so we had to back off some 
 final part : we wanted to move to a different city by the time i was almost graduated from college so we were model citizens and just did n't talk to them 
 when our house did sell and we were moving out i waited to check the mailbox until they were out in their front yard 
 i checked the mail and began my walk back home when they said something along the lines of glad to see you move '' or good riddance '' 
 i stopped to turn at them made a show of smelling the air and said do you smell fish '' 
 then smiled before walking back home 
 their faces as they figured it out was priceless 
 do n't kill my dog 
 i 'll fuck your shit up 
 edit : okay i get it 
 y'all say the house would n't smell 
 obviously the plan still worked cause thie ac was messed up 
 this is by far the meanest thing i have said to anyone in public and it cost me a lot of female friends 
 during college i worked at a restaurant with a fairly large staff 
 between <unk> servers and 20 hostess on any given season i was friends with pretty much everyone and there was always a group of us hanging out after each shift late night house parties etc 
 because of that staff dating was common 
 i never really <unk> into the staff dating pool but there was one particular girl i was fond of at the time 
 we got along flawlessly and we were hanging out all the time during work and afterwards at parties 
 rumor spread that we were secretly dating 
 i tried asking her out a few times but she always turned me down 
 never giving a reason 
 i was n't <unk> about it 
 just figured i was n't her type or she was n't attracted to me 
 no big deal she was still cool to hang out with 
 about a year goes by and finally a few of my female coworkers <unk> the reason why this girl kept turning me down 
 the big mystery ... ... i was too short 
 nothing else that was the only thing holding her back 
 the news spread quickly 
 not going to lie it made me bitter but i held my tongue for almost another year 
 over that period she had gone off to school 
 we still kept in touch and i stayed friendly with her because she was still picking up shifts when she was back in town during the holidays or <unk> breaks 
 anyways college life must have hit her hard 
 she packed on the freshman 15 and a little more 
 i would n't say she got fat maybe chubby 
 she went from say 110 pounds to <unk> this is when i started noticing her attitude towards dating me had changed 
 her friends were dropping hints like crazy that i should ask her out again 
 despite the fact of her shallow <unk> beforehand 
 this is where i hit my tipping point and was pissed off to my core 
 it all came to a boiling point one fateful night after work 
 we were both liquored up and she kept pushing me for an answer on why i hadn’t asked her out yet 
 so i gave it ... out loud ... in front of all the coworkers at the party 
 40+ people i tried asking you out for a year and you turned me down every time 
 <unk> giving me a reason why '' 
 now i 'm <unk> 
 the only reason you would n't go out with me before was because i was too short 
 nothing has changed minus you packing on a few lbs and your self-esteem has dropped 
 you were shallow so here 's my reason 
 because i do n't date fat chicks '' 
 75 % of the female staff stopped speaking to me after that as i was <unk> the biggest asshole in the world 
 however 100 % of the guys agreed it was a double standard and justice was served 
 to be honest it was her shallow attitude that hit me the most and i wanted her to know what that felt like 
 it 's been over 10 years now and looking back i sometimes ask myself if i should have said it and my answers has n't changed yet 
 yes ... yes i would edit : <unk> to fond i 'll laughing at myself 
 it is funny add on : wow do some girls really not see this as a double standard getting a lot of hate email 
 add on : she openly told a group of about 20 female co-workers 
 not sure what she thought was going to happen 
 word spread and yes i was publicly humiliated as it because a common joke at work 
 i bit my tongue and take all of it for a year 
 my issue was her changing her mind like i 'm some 2nd place prize 
 her friends assumed i was n't interest anymore because of her weight gain and throw it in my face all the time that she was still the same person 
 i never said a word about her weight before that night 
 label me asshole then an asshole i will be 
 so a friend of the mentioned sister has a set of twins 
 no clue where they picked up this habit but about every two minutes of their waking lives they love to scream in the way only 4 year old children can 
 the kind of scream that is so high pitched your ears will ring after only a few seconds of it 
 but these two little girls do n't just scream for a few seconds they hold this sound for what seems like eternity until their mom screams back at them to stop 
 so this sounds really annoying and it is but these girls have actually turned out to be pretty good for me since i do n't see them but like 1-2 times a year max and here 's how 
 just a few months ago my sister asked if i wanted to go to the zoo with her and my nephew the friend with the two <unk> and our other sister who is cf like me 
 i say sure i love seeing the <unk> and taking pictures of the pretty birds so why not 
 we go and the twins throughout are pretty good no screaming and we 're already about half way through the day 
 we 're taking our lunch break at this big <unk> plaza on one side of the zoo and the two girls start their screaming thing when they finish eating 
 my sisters kid my nephew is pretty laid back and usually pretty quiet 
 he 's just like his mom except that my sister is also one of those people that once they get a stick up their ass will push their point in a conversation until you just give up because she just does n't make sense anymore 
 being that i am cf and have proclaimed as much for many years she likes to say <unk> you 'll change your mind all of the time 
 so on this fateful day as i 'm eating a piece of pizza and have just heard the first set of screams from the twins she starts with how that sound does n't bother her as much as it bothers me because i 'm 'not a mommy yet 
 as soon as she says this i look down at my nephew who is just at the age of understanding and being able to <unk> questions 
 i say do you hear the sound their making '' 
 he looks at them for a second looks back at me and nods and i give him my most encouraging smile 
 mommy loves that sound 
 you should make it for her all the time '' 
 cue the moment i stood and walked to another table with my other cf sister who is just laughing her ass of as our nephew joins the chorus of screams and ignores his mom who 's saying <unk> over and over again in the parent <unk> <unk> <unk> does no wrong voice and she is being promptly ignored by him as usual 
 the rest of the zoo visit continues with me and cf sister splitting from childed sister and childed friend so that we can actually look at animals instead of walking past as the kids ca n't stop or they 'll <unk> from their <unk> and run <unk> 
 we enjoy ourselves even more as we get a chorus of vocal reminders of where they are in other parts of the zoo the entire afternoon 
 we leave that afternoon before our sister and her friend are done since we drove separately and i do n't think much of it 
 fast forward to today <unk> months after the zoo trip 
 we live in different cities which are only 20 minutes apart and because of work and stuff we do n't meet up very often 
 my sister calls me and in the background i hear the screaming 
 it 's been over 3 months and he still does it even when the twins are n't around 
 after hanging up from our brief chat about an upcoming wedding we 're both attending i suddenly realize that i have gotten the most <unk> revenge i could possible get without actually being there and doing anything to her myself 
 i shall now <unk> in the <unk> of what i 've done 
 update : we went to our other sisters kid so our <unk> birthday party recently 
 he turned 1. her screaming monster finally quit the screaming sometime recently but i know that dad must have been the one to do something based on what happened there 
 brother in law d is playing with all the kids and trying to keep them entertained when i notice the screamer being really mean to d. hitting him with sticks and saying mean things because he talks more now 
 we 're sitting at a nearby table with some other adults watching all of this 
 me : should n't you stop him from acting like that 
 her : well i did n't <unk> him up d did so d get 's to settle him back down 
 cf sister : i thought you were his parent 
 me : no because that means she 'd actually take responsibility and whip his ass for something once in a while 
 her : <unk> then walks away after a minute to go talk to someone else while ignoring her <unk> back in the mid 90s i acquired a job at a local parts store 
 there was the mgr l the assistant mgr r and me i along with three more employees 
 i quickly <unk> the ranks and within a month i was swing mgr 
 this made r <unk> 
 r began to find fault with everything i did and tried everything in his power to make me look bad in front of l. this went on for months 
 any time i closed and r opened there was always an issue 
 the door was n't locked the alarm was n't set the store was a mess ... however none of this happened whenever i closed and l opened or if l & amp r opened together 
 l mentioned to me to watch my back around r b/c the dm would be making his rounds soon and r 's input might hurt my chances for another promotion 
 i <unk> a plan 
 i waited until a day in which l & amp i opened together and r came in later to close 
 around 11:30 i mentioned to l that i was hungry and would he like a sandwich from <unk> before he left 
 i mentioned that i had been doing more computer work lately and had some extra money so it was no big deal he could buy my lunch sometime later 
 he said ok i went & amp got the lunch we ate & amp he left 
 around 2pm r came in and my first order of business was asking him if i could borrow $ 10 for lunch b/c i was <unk> & amp had n't eaten 
 he was all <unk> ... man <unk> ... .i sure do n't '' 
 before i left that evening i took $ 50 from the register 
 i was off the next day 
 i went & amp bought beer & amp cigarettes 
 the following day when i returned l met me at the door 
 he said 'i i had to fire your buddy 
 i said what 
 why 
 he said the register came up short & amp when it did the first thing out of his mouth was <unk> was 'i he was asking me for money to get lunch with 
 l said i looked him in the eye and said 'i know you 're a damn liar he ate lunch with me and even bought mine you 've been trying to sabotage him from day one and i 'm sick of it 
 you 're fired get your stuff and get out over the course of the next few months i slowly paid the money i 'd taken back into the register 
 in less than a year i 'd decided that i wanted to do computers full time so i quit 
 a few years later i met r in a store somewhere in town his only words to me were <unk> 're a sonofabitch i dated a girl for about four years lets call her <unk> 
 we were best friends before we dated then we dated for about four years 
 she was awesome 
 i loved her very <unk> 
 as far as i knew we were awesome together and great as friends and as <unk> 
 we rarely ever fought 
 we got along great 
 we got engaged and had plans to get married 
 as far as i knew everything was perfect 
 in fact i still doubt i will ever find another partner that i am that compatible with 
 i spoiled her too 
 maybe that was my biggest fault 
 i always let her go shopping whenever wherever she wanted i kept her fed from a golden spoon and wrapped in the <unk> <unk> 
 even if she did n't ask i typically enjoyed <unk> her 
 that 's just how i am 
 she had recently gotten a part time job as a funeral directors assistant paying $ 10 an hour and i had subsequently gotten her a new cellphone line for her as a work line as a <unk> gesture because she had been wanting a note 5 and was n't due for an upgrade 
 she said she would pay for the balance on the old phone with her first check 
 then one autumn day our only car got repoed 
 she called the bank the bank said i was three months behind on my payments 
 i knew that wasnt right 
 that 's when she told me it was n't working out 
 she said she was tired of being broke and struggling financially 
 she wanted something better out of life than being broke all the time 
 the interesting thing to note here is that she hadnt worked in a couple years and had been living off of my paycheck 
 i 'm a network engineer live <unk> in a fairly nice house with lots of the latest toys and gadgets and everything but my <unk> car is paid for 
 i would hardly call that struggling 
 but it apparently was n't good enough for her 
 so she left after the car got repoed 
 i was upset about it and went to my mothers house for the day while she packed her shit 
 while i was at my moms i paid the repo fees and the past due balance for the amount the bank told me that was owed 
 turns out the balance was for a different account the bank had repoed the wrong vehicle and given me the wrong account number to pay 
 so i paid somebody else account 
 they fixed it applied the balance to my not past due account and promptly gave me my car back i came back that evening with some friends and she had taken everything 
 she took all of the furniture except a couch and my bed and my kids beds 
 she took <unk> decorations food basically everything that was n't nailed down 
 also when she left she took her two cellphones that i have been paying for on a payment plan 
 so i still had to deal with my cell phone bill being $ <unk> for three phones when i only use one of them 
 i still owe $ 1200 for those two phones then there was a matter of a $ 2,000 loan she had taken out with my mom that she had agreed in writing to pay back 
 i sent her an email a few days later asking for my stuff back and for the money she owed and she responded that i was <unk> her and that if i ever contacted her again she would call the cops and threatened bodily harm from her stepdad 
 so i suspended her lines and did n't say anything 
 she called me from a borrowed phone the next day to ask me if i was going to tell her before i turned her phone off 
 i said i did n't feel like i need to since they were my phones and the account was in my name 
 since then she has tried to have my electricity turned off 
 which did n't happen because they called me to confirm 
 she has tried to sell my car without having it in her possession which failed 
 she has tried to call the police on me for harassment dumped trash in my yard and called the homeowners association and broken into my house and left things and taken other things on several different occasions 
 i have changed my locks and set up security cameras since then 
 so enough of the backstory 
 here 's where my revenge comes in 
 i took her to small claims court for $ <unk> for property and damages and all the money she owed and i won 
 granted i have to pay to have that enforced and honestly i do n't even care to <unk> it 
 but i won 
 revenge is mine i also got a promotion at my job since she left was recently given a a raise and a big fat bonus just got a $ 1,000 voucher from <unk> since they screwed up my flight and things are generally better than they had been before she left <unk> 
 she lives with her mom in a tiny room with no air conditioner and no heater ca n't get a car my buddy owns a car lot she tried to buy from him because everybody else had turned her down 
 he turned her down on principal or a cell phone because of her credit and relies on friends and family to drive her to her 2 day a week job and school 
 she also owes $ <unk> for school loans for her first couple years and shes got four more years left to go 
 but i guess thats better than struggling right 
 tl dr fiance tried to take everything because of an error on the <unk> part that resulted in our car being repoed screwed herself over in the process then i put the final nail in the coffin by suing her and winning 
 edit # 1 : a letter edit # 2 : i just wanted to add this 
 after i suspended her phone lines she got really angry and attempted to get revenge in a number of ways all of which failed 
 1. she tried to sell my car to a dealership without having the car with her 
 how stupid can you be 
 2. she tried to have my electricity turned off 
 3. she hacked my facebook <unk> broke into my house several times left things took other things until i changed the locks and put in security cameras 
 5. she tried to close out my loan account with the bank and have them repo the car 
 they told her as long as it was being paid for they would n't repo the vehicle under any circumstances 6. she tried hacking all my email accounts bank accounts steam account xbox account and any other account she could to try and screw me over 
 <unk> she managed to cancel one of my debit cards but it was n't my main one and she did n't take any money she just wanted me to face the <unk> of not having a debit card 
 8. she threatened me multiple times physical bodily harm '' from her stepdad and brother 
 <unk> dumped trash on my lawn and called the homeowners association 
 10. frequently sent me pictures of that cat that we adopted 
 this one hurts a little bit but i 'll never let her know that 11. made sure that everybody knows what a horrible person i am and how shitty i was <unk> her entire relationship 
 through all that the only time i ever contacted her was to ask for my stuff back 
 once 
 that 's it 
 i gave her a list of stuff that she took told her she had a week to give it back or else 
 if she ever attempted to contact me i ignored it completely 
 she flipped the fuck out and started trying to somehow enact revenge 
 i never once called the police on her i never let on that any of it bothered me i never said hey why did you do this 
 but she kept on <unk> trying to screw me over failing every single time 
 i never <unk> or batted an eye 
 that to me is the <unk> victory 
 i do n't know if this is truly petty revenge but it may fit ... a few weeks ago one of our fellow employees be for belittled employee decided he had enough of his manager 's constant belittlement and short temper so he gave his 2 weeks notice and let them know he was more than happy to work those two weeks to finish off his job 
 said anger management issues manager ami is also an owner of the company 
 he absolutely loses it 
 he starts screaming at the guy telling him to leave the premises immediately and flips him the bird on the way out the parking lot 
 this action causes <unk> problems for us in the short term 
 be had a transmission for a large machine pulled apart with hundreds of parts <unk> across his bench 
 that was friday 
 i come in on tuesday morning and i am informed the other owners have decided they need to buy this owner out 
 finally 
 this was n't the first time he had cost us an employee i was hired and work directly under the general manager gm who is also an owner with his brother 
 while we are talking about this in my office i politely ask my boss to hang on and i dig through my desk and fire up some of our accounting software 
 i quietly show some of the evidence of ami 's <unk> to gm 
 it is n't enough to be a smoking gun of fraud that is why i was waiting before bringing it to him 
 i also only noticed the issues a few weeks ago and was waiting until i had more evidence 
 gm smiled slightly thanked me and left 
 we went back to business as usual until the buyout 
 <unk> to now ami is getting bought out 
 after they have settled on a price for the buyout and signed everything gm brings the evidence of fraud against ami which he has now added to by digging a little deeper 
 ami now has to pay back the fraudulent payments out of his buyout resulting in him getting approximately <unk> % <unk> 25 % less than what he thought he was getting 
 **update : ** found out how the gm handled it 
 ami signed all the papers and signed something to the effect that his department 's financials were accurate 
 just after he signed that paper gm reveals the paperwork in epic fashion as per his brother 's description 
 ami absolutely loses his shit and starts screaming 
 his lawyer had to calm him down 
 business <unk> was around 10 million and he had a 30 % stake so it cost him $ <unk> 
 also a call has been placed to the revenue agency in our country for suspected tax evasion by gm and yours truly as my boss has evidence of some private fraud now as well 
 **update # 2** bosses are implementing an employee purchase plan for stock ownership <unk> shares 
 and essentially they are giving me 2 % of the company shares as my bonus along with a raise 
 i 'll take it 
 **tl dr : angry owner loses his shit on employee other owners decide to buy him out i present evidence of fraud to owners and he gets less money at the buyout 
 ** edit : moved tl dr to <unk> parents live in a pretty suburban neighborhood and kinda keep to themselves they are indian and are the nicest people but are quiet to everybody except a few well known friends in the neighborhood they also have heavy indian accents 
 most of the neighborhood are <unk> nice to us except this one kid who hates my parents for complaining about him speeding down our residential inner roads at dumb speeds and makes fun of them using <unk> mocking of their accents 
 long story short this kid got his buddies together and <unk> baseball batted our mailbox there was no way to prove it was him and i only knew he did it because he would make fun of my dad or myself when we went to our bent mailbox and he happened to be passing by windows rolled down yelling out oh no '' 
 in a fake indian accent and driving away 
 even worse was we ended up fixing the mailbox once and over a year and half later it was batted down again i suspect the same kid but again had no way to prove it was him 
 this last year however i decided to say fuck this kid '' and built a <unk> concrete pole for our mailbox with <unk> in it 
 i painted it too to make it <unk> it was cement and made sure to put those solar lights on it so that it 'd be lit in the night and no one would accidentally run into it 
 the only reasonable chance of hitting it would be if you were trying 
 this kid took over a year for his previous revenge so we ended up waiting after building that until last thanksgiving during the night we heard a loud <unk> '' outside of what sounded like <unk> bat being stopped dead in its tracks a short loud yelp and a car speeding off 
 in the morning it looked like this : kid has n't mouthed off yet and his hand was in one of those <unk> for a while it felt satisfying 
 i plan to <unk> a hurt hand '' every time he drives by again.this is a story that happened over the span of a few years 
 when i first started med school i had a girlfriend who was decently attractive 
 not 10/10 but definitely a solid <unk> 
 unfortunately she thought of herself as a 10/10 and acted like one too 
 as med school wore on i started spending more time studying and less time caring for myself 
 as she was a 10/10 '' and thus had no business doing anything beneath her i was the only person who was doing the cleaning cooking and paying for the apartment we shared 
 this took up even more of my time as i entered my internship 
 sometimes i 'd come back to a dirty apartment that i 'd have to clean up after a long shift and i only had less time to take care of myself as a result so my appearance suffered i got <unk> and some days i 'd have to rush out the door without shaving because i 'd only gotten two hours of sleep after cleaning and cooking 
 she 'd never help and she was verbally and sometimes physically abusive 
 i stayed with her because i was deeply in love with her 
 about half a year into my internship i found out my girlfriend was cheating on me with some art student she said was there for her '' and made her feel special and needed '' 
 i told her to get out of my apartment and she was all too happy to do so 
 fast forward a few years and she 's in a master 's program in europe an starts talking to me again 
 i 'm on the <unk> of finishing my residency and about to start earning the big bucks '' people think doctors earn 
 she asks me for another chance i was tempted to go for it until she started verbally abusing me again over our <unk> sessions 
 i hatched a plot : i told her she 'd have to quit her master 's program and come to the states within three months she was graduating in six 
 she was <unk> to do so but i told her that if she wanted me back she needed to give me a show of good faith 
 i guess she figured she 'd <unk> me by <unk> me with marriage because she agreed 
 the day before she was due to fly out to the u.s. i told her i was lying 
 i blocked her on all my accounts and never spoke to her again 
 from what i understand she 's now surfing couches getting by on begging for <unk> from what few friends she made in europe and sometimes fucking some dude twice her age so he 'd throw money at her 
 tl dr : do n't cheat on med students 
 we bust our asses during med school and if anyone <unk> us we remember that shit for the rest of our <unk> couple of decades ago <unk> 's i had occasion to need body work done on my car kid in the lane to my right tried to turn left without looking and took it into a large and supposedly <unk> body shop for repairs 
 in hindsight i should 've known it would n't turn out well when they refused to give me a quote without seeing my insurance estimate first ... to keep this short suffice to say that they screwed it up charged for <unk> that was n't applied got cheap <unk> replacement parts ignored instructions to replace the <unk> was <unk> by the insurance co. and <unk> a couple of pounds of <unk> on it instead doing a miserable job of matching the <unk> and myriad other screw-ups 
 within a week of getting the car back from them i 'd returned with a long list of problems quality complaints and <unk> 
 the general manager found later he was the owner 's nephew and had a rep for being an asshole basically blew me off with a combination of <unk> and <unk> - as to the quality complaints he said look this car is n't worth putting <unk> work into it - you want it done better you 'll have to pay us more money '' 
 i then did what most <unk> customers do - <unk> the company to anyone who would listen 
 anytime i saw any car in need of <unk> i 'd warn the owner against this body shop making my case by showing them the poor work done on my car 
 i continued doing this for at least 4 years until i finally sold the car 
 the real revenge part was that about every 4 to 6 months i 'd call the shop and ask to speak to the gm when i got him on the phone i 'd identify myself as a <unk> former customer and tell him that i 'd saved a dozen or so people from his company 's <unk> work and i 'd probably cost his shop about $ 10,000 or <unk> 
 the first two calls he blew off by the 4th call he was getting worried and wanted my name and for me to come in so that we could come to an agreement and get you satisfied '' - i told him he had already blown his one chance to make good by insulting me when i came back to get them to do the job right 
 as to my name i told him he could easily find it by going over his list of customers who 'd come back with complaints about the work they 'd done 
 i continued the calls even after i 'd sold the car for about 6 years or so towards the end of that time i 'd point out to him that his attitude had potentially cost his company over $ 100,000 worth of work 
 on my last call i actually got the owner the nephew was on vacation and spent a good 15 minutes on the phone with him explaining why i 'd made it a <unk> mission to cost them as much business as i possibly could and that his jerk of a gm had blown any chance of ever getting me to quit bad-mouthing them 
 i later heard from friends at a wrecking yard in the same town that the body shop had a new gm ... sorry this is short but there really is n't a whole lot that went into it 
 basically we have a vp who is the caricature of asshole bosses 
 he verbally abuses his subordinates he <unk> bullying with leadership '' and he does n't have a god damn clue what he 's doing 
 well i and a few other project managers had enough of his shit 
 we met for lunch and one of my colleagues came up with a great plan ... we learned the <unk> 's daughter was looking for a position 
 so we put in a recommendation for her and told her to do everything she could to hide her <unk> under the <unk> that the vp and her dad did n't get along and wanted to make sure she could get the job 
 she got the job 
 it went way better than we hoped 
 not only did he give her shit and swear at her on a number of occasions apparently he called her into his office and told her the only position he was willing to keep her for was under his desk '' 
 we got the <unk> announcement on <unk> and it seems the vp is off to pursue the next great chapter of his life '' 
 i hope that chapter involves him <unk> shit somewhere 
 *i did n't see the announcement until today when one of the other pms texted mission accomplished '' 
 i get dozens of those things in a week and i just ignore them half the <unk> i was 9 i had a cat that i loved she came when i cried slept in my bed the works 
 one day she came home real fucked up 
 she had a <unk> hole in her chest cracked <unk> and her spine was snapped at the base of her tail 
 we took her to the vet and they told us she had been beaten up by some kids 
 they had hit her with a golf club and swung her around by her tail almost killed her 
 she had to go through surgery but she lived 
 we called the police who told us they could n't do anything because she probably was hit by a car 
 even though there were no scratches on her or <unk> from a road 
 but that would n't stop me from getting my revenge 
 later that week on the bus some of the kids from down the street were bragging about the cat they beat up 
 i asked them for the details acting all excited about it 
 once i was sure it was them i hatched my plan 
 a week or so after that i snuck out of the house stole a gas can from the garage and a box of matches 
 i walked through the woods i live in the middle of fucking nowhere to the kids house 
 now this kid loved his dirt bike and he kept it in his back yard 
 so i hopped the fence and poured the gas all over this dirt bike and set it on fire 
 then like a god damn badass i walked back to my house 
 i never got caught or even questioned 
 seeing that kid crying on the bus telling his shitty friends how he no longer had a dirt bike to ride was the most satisfying thing of my life.i found my way here via a story over on tales from retail because a user had suggested one story should be <unk> here 
 after reading some of the stories here and giggling to myself at my work desk i <unk> a story from my teenage years that should definitely be shared 
 i spent my high school years in a small town in wisconsin 
 there were only a few stop lights and everyone knew everyone 
 if you screwed up or did something embarrassing everyone knew about it within hours sometimes sooner 
 i had a small circle of friends and then a host of acquaintances '' that i hung out with from time to time 
 one of them is the center of our story 
 he was a pretty good guy 
 we 'll call him ted for story 's sake 
 the problem of course was that he was your standard outcast in high school life 
 he was n't athletic played video games in a time when gamers truly were considered nerds or <unk> and was a skinny kid with glasses which made him easy to pick on 
 i have been and always will be a <unk> so he and i had no issues getting along 
 i was slightly more athletic and played football so i was able to at least keep some guys off of his back for him 
 there was nothing i could do about the hockey guys though 
 let 's go to the event in question 
 it was a saturday and we were at the bowling alley with a couple of our mutual friends 
 all was going well until several members of said hockey team come walking in and of course get put in the lane just a couple down from us 
 close enough where they could be dicks and show off in front of their girlfriends 
 of course they singled him out and left the rest of us alone but that does n't really fly very well with me and tried to get them to stop which failed of course 
 after putting up with their bullshit for an entire game ted finally showed a little <unk> and quite loudly told them to shut the fuck up and leave him alone 
 well in small town logic doing something like that means you are asking for more trouble or maybe it 's just terrible high schooler logic 
 that you do n't want 
 one of the players said to him : <unk> you 're going to be a big man now 
 well do n't worry 
 we 'll put you in your place 
 ** i stepped in and told them to just leave us alone and that nothing needed to happen because it was really pointless as just about everything was regarding high school issues 
 they stopped it and we finished our game heading out to one of our mutual friend 's house to hang out there 
 we think nothing of it and i head home pretty late that night 
 my phone rings the next morning 
 it 's ted 
 he 's crying 
 *ted : <unk> they egged my house last night ... * & gt the hockey guys 
 *ted : yes 
 it 's a mess 
 * & gt how bad is it 
 and how do you know it was them 
 *ted : one of them called me to rub it in 
 we had the windows open 
 some of it got in here 
 * i headed over there shortly and sure enough the house was absolutely pelted and covered with <unk> marks egg shells etc 
 inside the house were at least seven or eight direct hits 
 it was pretty gross 
 i stuck around and helped him clean it up 
 during the clean-up though i realized that ted was not only over his crying but he was plotting revenge 
 when we were done cleaning up he started calling up a couple of his friends for ideas 
 he was n't going to be able to get everyone back but he could at least get the one that seemingly led the charge 
 and he did get him 
 holy shit did he get him 
 being in wisconsin one thing that <unk> really like to do besides drink illegally is to chew tobacco 
 he had a couple of friends who did just that and because they were n't exactly the <unk> people around had some bottles of spit and other things laying around 
 he asked them to bring him whatever they could 
 before they came over with those bottles he went and bought a couple dozen eggs 
 i assumed he was going to return the favor of egging the house and just taking it one step further 
 nope 
 he was out to do damage 
 & gt so what 's the plan 
 *ted : i 'm going to get however big of a container that i need and throw all of this together 
 rotten eggs chew spit whatever else i can find 
 * <unk> up in mouth a <unk> & gt that 's ... <unk> that 's pretty damn good 
 you going to throw it on the asshole 's house 
 *ted : oh no 
 something way better than that 
 * he ended up <unk> all of it into a small bucket 
 there was a lot of it 
 it was extremely disgusting 
 to top it off he left it outside in the sun to just kind of stew for awhile 
 it was an unusually warm spring for us so leaving that outside to stew was pretty damn <unk> 
 he left it outside for a week 
 by the time the following weekend rolled around this was some of the worst smelling shit i had ever encountered 
 the kid had a plan and he was going to do whatever he had in mind 
 his parents were trying to figure out if it was possible to do an investigation but with no witnesses there was n't much they could do 
 phone calls meant nothing and ted figured this was the best option 
 ted 's plan was simple : you see hockey asshole had a brand new truck 
 it also had a pretty good sound system in it and these guys would hang out in parking lots and just sit around talking bitching and he would have his windows wide open 
 ted was getting that bucket of <unk> into the cab of his truck 
 he did n't care how 
 unfortunately i was not around to witness this 
 i was out of state with family the weekend that it occurred but i did get the phone call from our friend who drove him to the hang out 
 he was lucky enough to catch them in the parking lot and far enough away from the truck where he had a clean shot 
 they pulled up along side of the truck and ted managed to pop out launch the contents of the bucket into the cab through the window and get back into the car before they could make it to him 
 while on the phone with the <unk> driver i could hear ted laughing so hard in the background he was hyperventilating 
 i was concerned that he was going to get into major trouble but he truly did not give a fuck 
 he had reached his breaking point and was <unk> in the glory of his revenge 
 i got back to school on monday and it was the talk of the school 
 the truck 's interior was flat out ruined and smelled like sex <unk> 
 he could n't even drive it because ted had managed to do a <unk> strike and douse just about everything and then just chucked the bucket into it upside down to ensure it all got in there 
 he had become a legend in the manner that he had hoped for 
 ted had been concerned that he was going to get his ass kicked because of this and truth be told i think everyone expected it 
 however it did n't happen because word had already reached the higher ups in the school 
 my town was very much a good ol boy town where eye for an eye '' still meant something 
 the two of them were brought into a meeting and told that they were not to even speak to each other 
 as for the damages caused both sets of parents were informed of what was shared in the meeting where each of them admitted to their actions 
 the parents were asked to handle discipline of each of their children and to work out the issue of the damages caused 
 the parents ended up <unk> to just take care of their own problems and leave it at that 
 no one bothered ted after that 
 hockey asshole 's truck became known as the spit cup truck '' which pissed him off to no end 
 ted ended up getting a girlfriend out of the whole mess because honestly showing that kind of balls it just had to happen 
 he never really became a popular '' kid in high school but no one dared to fuck with him after that 
 and that my friends is a dish of revenge served ice cold 
 **tl dr : friend gets his house egged by asshole 
 revenge comes in the form of a bucket of tobacco spit and rotten eggs in said asshole 's truck 
 <unk> ensues 
 <unk> posting this on /r/idontworkherelady/ i was told i should post it here 
 hope you guys like it 
 i just discovered this sub and have spent the better part of the day <unk> and <unk> as i can relate 
 so on to the backstory : the town i lived in was n't huge and at the time only had one gas station 
 i got a job there at the ripe old age of 15 and worked there for 2 years 
 by the end of my time there i was essentially number 3 with the manager and <unk> ahead in charge 
 eventually another gas station opened up across the road and i got a job there 
 there was pretty high turnover so by the end of my <unk> there everybody else including the managers were new 
 this story takes place about a year after i left them 
 one last thing to say puberty is a bitch and did n't feel like making its way over to me forever so from age 12 to 18 i looked like the same 
 not exactly but i looked really young until about 19 a little bit insecure about it soooo since i knew all the employees at the store i would always get gas and grab a nice ice cold chocolate milk from there rather than my store 
 when i got to the fridge with my milk i was <unk> to find that there was no more 
 but seeing as i spent the entirety of my working time at the same store i knew that they kept the stock in the back of the <unk> fridge behind some boxes 
 this fridge was also where all the beer was so when a customer old bitch noticed that i knew what i was doing assumed i worked there 
 that seems fair considering she had probably seen me there on many occasions and i usually have no problem helping people 
 oh if i had known that how good a day this would turn out to be 
 ob : hey kid 
 knowing that there was n't anybody else in this tight ass fridge i turned around from <unk> about in the boxes 
 ob : ya you go put this case of beer at the cash 
 <unk> out case of beer* even if i did work there i would n't have done it but i figured i 'd gently remind them i am an actual person 
 me : sorry i do n't work here anymore 
 plus miss that was really rude '' 
 i 'm going to have to assumed that i triggered something for her because she lost her shit screaming about how she had seen me here before and she knew i worked here 
 i tried to get a word in edgewise but was unable to and with her between the door and myself i figured i might as well try and ignore her and find my <unk> goodness 
 ob : '' look at me when i 'm talking to you 
 you ungrateful child '' 
 me : '' look it seems like you 're having a bad day so i 'm going to let all that slide and just remind you that i no longer work here '' 
 with a huff she turned around and walked out but not before she threw out one last insult 
 ob : '' your mother must have been incompetent to have raised such a selfish boy '' 
 i had been having a good day up until that point because my usual self is a vindictive little shit who normally would have screamed right back at her 
 that changed when she insulted my mother 
 i found my drink and went to the registers 
 these machines were <unk> and took about 15 minutes to boot up and <unk> frequently 
 karma strikes quick and without <unk> for when i got to the cash they were having some technical problem with it and the screen was <unk> 
 knowing there was nobody in the store except for myself the bitch and my buddy who just started working there about 3 months prior i was in no rush to help 
 when my friend finally got fed up with trying the usual <unk> procedure he looked up and asked for my help 
 when working there i was the <unk> person and i still frequently got calls from the management asking if i could pop by and fix something for them in exchange for some free candy 
 <unk> 
 i <unk> over at the screen and immediately recognized the problem and knew that it was a simple fix all he had to do was click two buttons at the same time 
 if you had thought that ob had gotten an quieter as this whole process was going on you were wrong 
 she must have seen the recognition in my face when i saw it because she started <unk> at me to fix it so she could get out of there 
 seeing my chance for revenge i struck 
 me : '' apologize '' 
 ob : <unk> <unk> '' what did you say to me '' 
 me : '' i would like you to apologize to me and i 'll fix the problem '' 
 ob : '' you little shit fix it right now or i 'll have you fired '' 
 me '' i 'd like to remind you that i do n't work here and i still expect an apology '' 
 i assume she was running late because after another 2-3 minutes of back and forth she finally <unk> 
 ob : <unk> '' i 'm sorry ... now will you fix the machine '' 
 and normally i would have accepted it but i still had another 30 minutes to get kill before i started work at the gas station across the road so i figured i 'd push it 
 me : '' sorry for what '' 
 more incoherent yelling from this lady and my friend tries to <unk> his laughter ... me : '' i did n't hear an apology in there '' 
 ob : '' i 'm sorry ... for being rude ... even though you were being a brat '' 
 i stared at her just thinking she was so close so so close she could have been free to enjoy her beer and free to annoy anybody else that crossed her path ... but alas it was not meant to be 
 me : '' nah 
 i do n't accept have a nice day '' 
 she had a dumb look on her face before it turned to a <unk> and she started screaming again 
 ob : i swear i 'm never coming back to this gas station ever again 
 the employees here are *expletive* *expletive* ... *expletive* ... '' as she stormed out 
 now most people would be content with that i however was not 
 i quickly hit the buttons fixing the machine and ran out yelling a quick goodbye and telling him i 'm pay for this tomorrow 
 see she swore the one thing i knew she would n't be able to keep she swore she was never coming back to that gas station 
 which could only mean she had one place to go for her booze 
 across the road to the gas station i work at the place where i 'm the number 1 employee and where the owner would back me up if he were there and if he was n't i was in charge 
 i ran over to my job and told the cashier to him to take a break sit back and enjoy the show 
 by the time i got there she had already rushed into the fridge to get her beer and when she got out she was greeted by the sight of me grinning from ear to ear behind the register 
 cut to 15 minutes of swearing later and she leaves again sans beer 
 my coworker standing there slack <unk> wondering how i was able to stand that verbal tirade and even more confused as to why i kept on laughing even more as she went on 
 that was a good day 
 <unk> edit : since the post blew up on <unk> i decided to throw in a bonus unrelated story and figured i might as well share it here 
 for that lovely compliment i 've decided to share a completely unrelated story from my time working at the gas station 
 i 'm sure you got this from the above story but if you did n't i 'll tell you about myself i can keep calm in virtually any situation 
 that said some people get to me it could be anybody doing something that just makes something snap 
 it very rarely happens but this was one of those times ... it was a day like every other when in walks a middle aged gentlemen now normally you would here how this guy looked like a tool or he came in swearing but not in this story 
 this man looked like your average joe maybe he looked a little grumpy but it was early sunday morning my favourite shift for other reasons so i could forgive a little <unk> 
 so i gave this man my usual <unk> greeting which was answered with a short grunt 
 still at least he acknowledge i said something not great but better than being ignore 
 as he reached into his pocket and threw his lottery ticket and some change at me 
 now nobody likes having shit thrown at them but i had had it happen before and it would certainly happen again 
 i assumed he wanted me to check his ticket and <unk> it but i figured it would be best to ask just in case 
 now only because i had been working in gas stations for 3 1/2 years was i able to guess thats what he wanted 
 my question which was certainly valid was met with this response : obviously now shut up and do your job '' 
 <unk> <unk> wtf i stared are him 
 it 's on i do n't know how i 'm going to get back at him and i have n't seen him before which must mean he does n't live in town 
 i only have moments left to get back at him but due to a combination of <unk> and laziness this sunday morning i could n't think of a clever way to get back at him 
 my mind was <unk> : shower him with kindness no not enough time throw his money on the ground could do better i was running out of time as i got his change and then i went to the default way i dealt with assholes 
 i felt like i had failed i could do so much and yet i was left to see him out with a cliche 
 hope your day is as pleasant as you are '' 
 i yelled out as he was almost out the door 
 thinking to myself how i had just missed the perfect opportunity 
 thats when it happened 
 he turned back he was walking back in 
 this was it round 2 was happening 
 at this point i was 19 for all the insults i hurled at puberty it threw them right back at me and hit me like a freight train i went from <unk> '' <unk> soaking wet to <unk> '' <unk> of muscle 
 i was not about to be intimidated by this man 
 he <unk> and then he went full soccer mom demanding to speak to my manager threatening to get me fired etc ... this went on for 5 minutes before he left as i got the final words : have a great day and remember to go fuck yourself '' it was not the greatest of wins but i believe i finished on the upper hand 
 i just did n't understand how somebody could get under my skin that easily 
 i pushed the thought from my mind knowing i would n't get in any trouble for what i said 
 all was forgotten ... until about 6 months later i 'm working my usual sunday morning shift <unk> nursing my hangover from the night before not sure if i 'm still drunk or not when in walks a customer 
 my head ringing because of the <unk> on the door 
 the man walks up and throws his shit at me and i ignore it because it hurts to look at the light 
 finally handing the man his cash i look up and this man 
 his face ... it looks familiar ... no it does n't mean anything i see the same people all the time ... i started to feel angry at this man for some reason ... i could n't understand why this random customer was infuriating me so much just looking at me as i had his change in my hand 
 my mind was telling my body to give him the change so i could get back to my <unk> but i could n't bring myself to do it 
 hey are you going to do your job or just stand there '' my eye <unk> i realized i still had the money in my hand so i put it on the counter instead of his <unk> hand thats not very nice i thought to myself 
 as i looked up again he was <unk> and it clicked 
 my eyes flashed recognition at the same time as his did 
 i saw him open his mouth but i had already started to unleash what would be the round one knock out 
 did n't i tell you to fuck off '' 
 already reaching down for the business card with the <unk> number on it i slammed it down on the counter and went back to my corner to wait for the count to declare me the <unk> champion as he walked out of the store already pulling out his phone 
 i laid back and waited for the inevitable phone call i was about to receive from the owner 
 i smiled as i <unk> back into my hangover induced <unk> friend of mine was <unk> at work 
 it was pretty bad 
 later on he was fired because he was <unk> 
 fortunately he turned that around when he learned he could get disability for the electrocution but it knocked out several teeth that are n't coming back 
 anyway i called osha and told them about the electrocution 
 they were n't so interested in that but <unk> right up when i told them that the place routinely locked the emergency fire exit doors to prevent employees from stepping outside to sneak a smoke 
 well they inspected found the locked emergency exit doors and went to town on them 
 turns out a long time ago a business on the east coast locked the security doors and there was a fire killing several dozen people 
 osha gets very very sensitive about stuff like that 
 the owner was fined $ <unk> for the security doors 
 he also spent quite a bit of money fighting it for 10 years but eventually had to pay <unk> the advice of my attorney i started recording all calls with my ex during the divorce process 
 <unk> at least at the time was a single party consent state 
 meaning only one person in the conversation had to know it was being recorded 
 the look on her face when i hit play and the judge got to hear her say i do n't give a fuck what that bitch judge says you get visitation when i say you get visitation '' was absolutely priceless 
 can you say contempt of court 
 i got everything i wanted out of the divorce with the judge landing on my side for any <unk> items 
 she even made my ex pay my attorney fees 
 tl : dr do n't ever get caught calling a female judge a bitch edit : the contempt was for refusing to comply with a court order of visitation 
 not the language she used 
 but the language she used did seem to <unk> the judge in my favor from that point on 
 copied and pasted from this thread this is not my story a buddy of mine use to do car <unk> in his <unk> for some extra cash during high school 
 one weekend i was helping him finish up a car 
 there was a local kid notorious for not paying for <unk> etc ... being a douche bag 
 so on this fair weekend said kid had <unk> a new radio for his honda accord 
 he asked my friend to install it no problem he probably asked him for $ 50 
 long story short his policy was cash upfront or no dice 
 kid came up with every excuse under the son as to why he needed it done and done fast but would pay for it later 
 so my buddy agrees i 'm shaking my head at this point but it was n't my call 
 we tear into his car while i 'm <unk> together the new <unk> my buddy is under the hood laughing and <unk> the horn and wiper wires 
 knowing the kid was n't going to pay he wired everything to a relay so when the radio turns on the horn and wipers also go on genius 
 kid comes to pick up his car end of the day and sure enough <unk> n't pay but threatens to call the cops etc etc so my buddy gives him the car back no hassle 
 my buddy said fine take it kid pulls out of the drive way and you hear <unk> <unk> and i remember us almost pissing ourselves laughing 
 kid gets pissed and threatens to sue cops etc ... my buddy tells him when he pays he will fix it kid tells him to go f himself 
 we never spoke to him after that but from what we heard his parents took the car to the dealership and payed $ $ $ $ $ to get it fixed 
 tl : dr kid refuses to pay for radio install gets his horn and wipers attached to his radio power button 
 do n't fuck with people servicing your shit 
 so your typical trailer trash redneck family move into my grandpa 's rental house 
 the father is a loud and easily enraged <unk> his wife almost never seen and one son is a rapist while the other is a <unk> bag of nuts 
 drugs and parties <unk> you get the idea 
 the house which could fetch $ 1400 a month which is generally a <unk> house in our area is destroyed over five or six years for only $ 600 a month 
 when he actually pays it that is 
 grandpa during this time is showing all the symptoms of <unk> and would normally never let someone get the better of him like this so at one point i start working with my father doing up keep in grandpas place 
 at this point i live in one of grandpas houses within walking distance of the one redneck has been living in so i of course had the great pleasure of being able to tape the multiple eviction notices to their doors when they had n't paid rent for 6 months 
 after all of the legal proceedings it has been eight months that they have n't paid rent and the sheriff is present as we set their things outside because the judge approved an immediate eviction 
 it probably helped when they did n't even show up to court to defend themselves 
 they had n't been seen for a couple days so they were n't present for this therefore we were courteous enough to bring in our own guys to <unk> move their things out 
 the <unk> there were happy to take every little bit of paraphernalia that was found in the process 
 redneck did show up later that night though so i stood on my porch out of sight and listened as he got out of his car to scream this is bullshit '' 
 as loud as he could in full redneck accent 
 we had already changed locks and literally bolted shut the windows so they left after collecting some random things and as is expected redneck <unk> his tires on the way out 
 they broke in the back door that night but did n't do any other damage and were already gone the next morning 
 we notified the police and replaced the door as it was weak anyway 
 for the full picture the house is a two story three bedroom with two full <unk> two large living rooms two large <unk> french doors onto a large deck and a garage as well as a <unk> in the back 
 it also came with all of the appliances some furniture and whatnot 
 the surrounding area is fields and woods with a really nice view out of the bay windows 
 my dad built this house with his own hands in the 70 's and i had been in the house before they moved in so it was genuinely sad to see the place like it was 
 when it 's all done and over with they are moved out and my dad ends up having to put a little over $ <unk> into the house to make it livable 
 it took three months of work and even after that a plumber and electrician had to go and fix several problems that were discovered with tests and use 
 new renters get moved in as soon as possible all is good and well but then one day on my way to work i see the rednecks family car parked at the end of the lane 
 it 's an old beater with the bumper and driver door both being different colors from the rest of the car so it 's hard to mistake 
 our family owned business is where he would usually pay rent and i 'm only at work for about an hour when i am told that i have a phone call on hold 
 i take the line and he does n't <unk> to start in his hard to understand <unk> 
 hey this is redneck 
 my car needs fixed and i left in the lane 
 can it stay there for a few days '' 
 i 'm grinning and i almost giggle after i 've thought it over for a second 
 sure 
 i do n't mind '' 
 he hangs up just like that and i do n't stop smiling as i start to look at local tow companies on the internet 
 i find the one with the highest rates at the responsibility of the cars owner and gave them a call 
 they even charged hourly for the time their driver was on the road so i was glad the place was a good while away 
 after waiting only half an hour after work the tow showed up and i was happy to watch as he got the car hooked up 
 once he got done i pointed him to the <unk> area where he could turn around and then he was gone 
 it was on the forth day that i got a phone call from redneck 's little wife and i 'm certain he was staring at her the whole time as she politely asked where the car had been sent 
 i think someone had it towed '' 
 i tell her with a <unk> that i will call her back as soon as i find out who towed it and where 
 that was on friday 
 so guess who did n't hear from me until monday 
 she answered and i told her hey i found out it was <unk> '' 
 being as polite as ever she thanked me and the line went dead 
 so that was four business days and two weekend days before they got to the car as i imagine they went to get it as soon as they found out 
 with the rates from their website i figured out that their bill should have been at least $ 700 
 there is no way that these people would have that much money as none of them were employed 
 their only money came from the two parents who got social security somehow despite only being in their <unk> <unk> 
 that was a year ago and i 've never seen that car on the local streets since 
 to this day i smile just thinking about <unk> dad was in construction in the 80 's in chicago and when the economy went bust he was hired by a company in houston that told him they 'd pay his moving expenses after one year of employment 
 he was brought in to be a general manager and the company he went to was having problems he was hired to solve 
 my dad was very efficient and got things fixed quickly 
 soon everything was a <unk> machine when his one year anniversary came up 
 the day before the anniversary he was let go by the company and his job went to the owner 's son 
 they told my dad they did n't have to pay him since the year was n't up 
 my dad was pretty pissed about it and by this time the economy in houston was n't so great so it took a while for him to find a job 
 when he did it was for a company that did <unk> work from time to time for the company he was let go from 
 as my dad was hired as an <unk> at the new company he had to bid jobs for his former company 
 as revenge he started adding money to each estimate 
 at first it was just a little but over the course of the next 17 years he would add tens of thousands to each job 
 even though the money was n't directly going into his pockets he did earn much larger bonuses and his employer realized much larger profit <unk> on the work from the other company 
 as my dad was retiring he did an review of all the estimates he ever made for that company and found he 'd gotten $ 2.7 million from them over 17 years 
 now my dad did n't get that money his employer did but that was $ 2.7 million that would have stayed with his former employer 
 so that $ <unk> they screwed my dad out of cost them $ 2.7 million over 17 years 
 he called the greatest caper of his life 
 he passed away 4 months after retiring sadly 
 he <unk> about it often though and he felt <unk> is my story of revenge from almost 20 years ago 
 bear with me i 'm posting this from mobile and it 's a little long and i 'm not the best writer 
 what i did might not be right or ethical but sometimes revenge is more important 
 **the <unk> i was fresh out of the military where i had been a supply clerk running my unit 's warehouse with about 20 guys working for me 
 the local job market was pretty crappy at the time the only place i could get a job was a distribution warehouse for a large clothing retailer 
 the guy who hired me charles was former military like me and an all around decent guy 
 he was the night shift supervisor 
 typically this place filled positions with temp workers from the local <unk> 
 if you did a decent job as a temp the company would hire you as a seasonal worker and the best seasonal workers would get hired at full time 
 on average out of 50 temps 1 would end up full time 
 well in the eyes of quite a few people i fucked it all up because i was hired directly to full time on night shift with a promise of an interview for management as soon as there was an opening 
 even though a few of the old <unk> '' didnt like the way i was hired i did n't let it stop me from making a few friends and within six months i was leading one of the teams on my shift with 10 of us on each team 
 let me tell you a little bit more about this place it was like nothing i 'd seen before 
 there were 2 shift day and night 
 each shift had about 20 employees per department divided into 2 teams and a shift supervisor the 2 shift supervisors reported to the department manager and there were 5 department managers that reported to the warehouse manager 
 there was also it lots of <unk> and maintenance but most people did n't interact with those departments on a regular basis 
 in my department we had 4 major job <unk> opening closing loading and unloading 
 in an 8 hour shift you would typically spend 2 hours doing each rotating stations between breaks 
 what made this place unique at the time was the way they tracked your performance 
 everyone carried around a gun '' that tied into the computer system and tracked literally everything you did 
 it knew how fast you were unloading how many units per second you were opening how many boxes per hour you were closing etc 
 the only process that was n't tracked that closely was loading at each break you would get a report of how on target '' you were for production goals for each job in <unk> 
 officially as long as you were making at least 90 % of the goal you were on target but anything below 80 % would get you a <unk> for the day which would go away if you finished the week above 90 % 
 i was a <unk> gunning for promotion so i typically ended the day above <unk> % 
 i think my lowest day for my first year there was 110 % 
 at the start of each shift the supervisors would get a huge text file that had more detailed information about our performance 
 they would spend a few hours every day <unk> it and compiling the data in it by hand into a spreadsheet that tracked performance for the week quarter and year 
 around my 9 month mark my knee was injured when some poorly stacked boxes fell on me and i was put on light duty for a month while i healed 
 i would still <unk> and close but loading and unloading were off the table 
 charles got the <unk> from our manager stacy for me to stay in the office for the first 4 hours of the shift and i would handle compiling the days data into the spreadsheet for him 
 by the 2nd day of doing this it was obvious that this job could easily be automated 
 so i did just that 
 i wrote a script that would automatically pull the text document off the server import the data into excel and <unk> the spreadsheet for the entire year 
 i 'd done similar stuff in the military so this was <unk> 
 by the end of the week it was working perfectly and i gave it to charles 
 this saved him almost 3 hours a day freeing him to spend more time on the other <unk> of his job 
 even though i had basically put myself out of a job for the remainder of my <unk> he still let me hang out in the office and we 'd bullshit about life our times in the service shit like that 
 like i said he was a cool dude 
 around this time my wife was pregnant with our second child which comes into play with what happened next and turned this all into a revenge story 
 while i was on <unk> they had pulled one of the <unk> off of day shift to come run my team 
 he 'd been working there about 5 years and felt like it was time for him to become a supervisor 
 he was another high performer like me mostly due to his drug of choice we 'll call him tweak 
 tweak was also best friends with the <unk> supervisor we 'll call him twat 
 tweak stayed on night-shift after i was healed because there was a rumor going around that charles was up for promotion which would leave the night-shift supervisor job up for grabs 
 <unk> me <unk> sure enough within 6 months of me writing that script charles was promoted to manager of another department 
 having all that free time probably helped but i was n't mad because like i said he was a cool dude and deserved it 
 he also put in a good word about me taking over his job 
 charles leaves and any day now we 're all expecting them to post the listing for his job 
 two weeks go by with no news and my wife goes into labor during one of my shifts 
 i drive home take her to the hospital and she gives birth to a beautiful baby boy 
 i 'd been working at that warehouse for over a year so i took my <unk> and spent 6 weeks at home taking care of her and my son 
 it turns out that our manager stacy had left twat in charge of hiring a replacement for charles 
 the day after my wife gave birth he finally posted the opening 
 he stacked the deck during an incredibly rushed interview process and tweak got the job 
 all of this happened within a week of my leave starting 
 i found out all of this from a co-worker while i was still out so i used my time off to start looking for another job 
 by the time my leave ended i had another job lined up 
 i wo n't go into it but it paid almost 4 times what the warehouse was paying me and actually sounded like a challenge 
 heck i 'm still with that company to this day 
 to be honest i didnt even have revenge on my mind at this point i just wanted out but what happened next pushed me over the edge 
 my leave ends but my new job does n't start for 3 weeks 
 i wait a week and give my 2 weeks notice 
 during that first week i 'm getting warnings about my performance every day 
 which is bullshit because my <unk> performance reports are still saying i 'm at <unk> % 
 i went into the office during my last break on friday and pull up the spreadsheet 
 it turns out that during my time loading '' which isnt tracked for performance tweak had been logging me in as opening '' which was driving my numbers down 
 at least i <unk> have to deal with it anymore as i gave notice that day at the end of my shift 
 the next week i only worked monday and tuesday 
 i had 7 days of vacation on the books so i took them off leaving me to return on friday my last day 
 i checked the spreadsheets at the end of monday and tuesday he was doing the same shit so i printed off the evidence just <unk> 
 the next friday i returned for my last day 
 i had cleaned out my locker on tuesday so really all i had to do was finish my shift and collect my final paycheck 
 instead i 'm greeted at the office by tweak and twat they have a few disciplinary <unk> that they want me to sign 
 apparently my performance was down all week and i had a <unk> no-show for not working saturday 
 i was <unk> why the hell would they write me up on my last day how the hell could my performance be down when i was on vacation and how could i be a <unk> no-show on a day that wasnt scheduled while i was on vacation 
 i refused to sign and told them i 'd meet them at hr in 10 minutes once i put my lunch away in the break room 
 **the revenge** instead i called my sister 's husband a <unk> deputy and let him know that these 2 <unk> had some meth or coke in their desks they usually did and walked to hr 
 i outlined to hr what was going on with my performance and the <unk> these 2 dicks were trying to push on me 
 tweak and twat came in and i dragged the whole confrontation out as long as i could 
 we were in there arguing for close to an hour when the cops showed up 
 they had a warrant to search the office in my department and pulled tweak and twat into the conference room while the search was conducted 
 twat 's area was clean but they found a <unk> of meth in <unk> desk and a couple of joints in his messenger bag 
 tweak tried to say that i had planted it in there but i 'd been gone all week and i had never set foot in the office that day backed up by security cameras 
 hr fired tweak on the spot as he was dragged out in handcuffs 
 the company placed twat on probation but he managed to keep his job 
 that was my petty revenge 
 the spreadsheet is where it turned pro 
 as i said i 'd made similar spreadsheets before while i was in the military and i 'd had other people take credit for creating them and try to pass them off as their own 
 so i started putting <unk> switches '' in them 
 nothing too malicious just <unk> the <unk> in each sheet and it performs a simple check 
 when you would run the scripts it would pull all the data for the day but it would also check my personal website for one thing : a <unk> 
 i run a small email server for my family its nice having a personal email thats just <unk> @ <unk> 
 it also has a <unk> so we can check our email from our <unk> 
 hidden in the <unk> for the webpage is a few <unk> that i use for different stuff 
 the spreadsheet i made would pull the <unk> warehouse '' which was just set to 1 and <unk> or divide every cell and <unk> by that 
 i knew that charles had given twat a copy of the script and thats what he was using for all his reporting 
 so when i got home i changed warehouse '' to <unk> or something like that 
 a small enough change that it would n't be <unk> on daily reports or even weekly but the quarterly reports were inflated enough to notice and the <unk> report was inflated enough that twat was fired for falsifying data to inflate his bonus 
 charles let me know about that he 's the warehouse manager now and he told me over beers a few months <unk> high school biology teacher mentioned <unk> that adding a small amount of a specific chemical to an <unk> drink would safely cause normally <unk> urine to turn a <unk> shade of red 
 i had access to the <unk> storage and i <unk> a modest supply 
 i tested the substance on myself and was pleased to see a shocking color change 
 my pee looked like cherry <unk> 
 cool 
 i <unk> my friends of course 
 they were shocked the first time mildly amused the second or third time but after repeated assaults i would generally just hear <unk> <unk> '' 
 from the bathroom 
 little fun 
 i looked for additional targets 
 the college guy next door seemed a good candidate 
 i <unk> his cola 
 i did n't know he was a chemistry major 
 he never said a word but a week later i peed blue 
 blue 
 <unk> retribution points for style 
 pro revenge <unk> friends take turns renting a vacation house for a month 
 i rented a large farm house with pool and housekeeper up the hill from a lovely beach town 
 six months out all the rooms are filled for the entire stay 
 my husband gets an email from his sister my <unk> sil saying that she and her mother mil will be coming for a visit 
 i tell my husband all the rooms are taken and send email to sil saying the same and give her the contact for a hotel in beach town 
 i come home to the farm house late one afternoon to find my sil and mil sitting in the living room 
 great i think two more for dinner and no advance warning 
 i say that i am going up to my room to change 
 two steps up the stairs my husband says there is a change in rooms 
 <unk> 
 i get to my room to find their luggage and things all over my room 
 i sleep on the floor 
 nah 
 a side note on mil 
 no one ever tells her no 
 our house heated to <unk> day/night when she visits in winter and <unk> in summer 
 all lights turned on all the time 
 her food in <unk> yours on counter etc 
 whatever 
 but after 15 years i had enough 
 my vacation house i paid for everything my rules 
 i packed up their things took luggage downstairs and put in their car 
 saying nothing 
 went in kitchen 
 the stove top is filled with pots madly bubbling 
 mil cooking is the worst 
 housekeeper has been unable to cook meal we had planned 
 i got the largest pot poured all the 'food in and had the housekeeper help me take pot out through living room to edge of forest 
 dumped it 
 went back in kitchen packed up their food took it to their car 
 went and stood in front of sil and told her there was no room in the house and they would have to get a room in beach town 
 turned to my husband and asked him to please escort his mother to their car 
 i went to the pool where all my friends were and waited 
 they took the next plane home 
 no means no 
 there is more information in the responses 
 first 2 paragraphs are a bit of backstory real pro revenge story starts from paragraph 3. tldr at bottom 
 so i 'm on my final year - final semester for an electrical engineering degree 
 i had completed all my major subjects however 5 of us 4th year students had n't done physics 2 since the first semester 
 physics 2 is a 1st year subject divided into 3 <unk> electricity <unk> modern physics but it surprisingly was n't a <unk> for any other subject 
 however we needed to take it now to graduate 
 being 4th year students we barely went to any lecture or did any coursework since it was a 1st year subject which we did n't take seriously 
 the first module was electricity and <unk> for which all the other 4 idiots failed and i did pretty well 
 in the second module the other 4 students just barely passed 
 we are now approaching the final exam in 2 weeks 
 here is where the pro revenge story begins 
 for the entire physics course the labs weigh 35 % of the actual grade 
 there are 9 experiments in total and we have to submit the lab report of all 9 reports at the end of the semester 
 i had 4 other final year students in my <unk> and not one of them would ever help out during experiments 
 i would literally do the entire lab alone and they would pretend to work whenever the instructor passed by 
 you know what 
 it does n't bother me 
 sometimes while i 'm working on an experiment one of them would poke me or slap the back of my head as a joke 
 still does n't bother me much i can laugh '' it off whatever 
 but what gets to me is that after 9 weeks of you guys slacking you message me to complete all the lab reports by myself and refuse to work telling me you did n't let us help you so we do n't know what to do '' 
 oh that got to me 
 i gave you guys a simple task of just plotting graphs with the different data that i had already collected 
 and you refused to do it 
 last week was the final day for submission for all the labs 
 i did n't submit a single one 
 today we all got a 0 % out of 35 % for the lab components where labs - 35 % module 1 exam - 20 % module 2 exam - 15 % module 3 exam - 15 % quizzes - 15 % the beauty of this is that even though i lost 35 % i can still pass 
 they ca n't 
 the subject is offered only once per year 
 in order to graduate now they have to wait an entire year 
 tldr : lab group members refused to help in lab i did n't submit any report and failed everyone and have them repeat an entire year 
 edit : for the people who ask why i would sacrifice my own grade 
 a it does n't affect my <unk> i 'm still graduating with a distinction 
 b when i meet them later on i can just say oh i did n't submit the lab because you did n't submit the graphs to me '' 
 c if i rat them out to the professor and i get a good grade they tell everyone that i intentionally failed them 
 it 's a small university 
 this way instead of them blaming me they can blame <unk> know i 'm not the best story <unk> but here it <unk> story is posted in my post history it 's my first post since this is a throwaway 
 i 'm normally a huge pussy due to social anxiety and stuff like that so i 'm really proud of this one 
 here 's the original story : tl dr for those who dont wan na read the previous post : a kid i was referred to he 's a stranger to me basically hooked me up and i trusted him as the middle man 
 my money disappears unsurprisingly 
 the kid stopped taking my calls stopped answering my texts so during my deep <unk> at 5am in my bed i hatched a plan 
 i know this kid is in highschool so he lives with his parents 
 he never gave me his real address probably because he was planning on ripping me off from the beginning 
 after some facebook stalking that came up <unk> i could only find his cousins but i did n't want to ruin his life completely by messaging them that their cousin is a drug dealer and <unk> i checked <unk> 
 all i got ta say is that <unk> should be illegal man i found his address <unk> it with where i picked him up his real address is one street over so i knew it was legit and more importantly his home phone number 
 so i sent him a simple text 
 i said i know you have my money 
 please return it or i will call your parents '' 
 he did n't reply 
 after a bit i sent him his address saying is this correct '' 
 i know i sounded threatening but i apologized to his mother later on saying that i did n't mean to sound threatening 
 he says no '' 
 well obviously he would say that so i just told him i 'd see him later 
 i asked if his parents are home before 2 and he said he lives alone which is bullshit and that he and his guys would be ready to throw down 
 i told him that i dont wan na fight and that just wan na talk 
 i gave him his chance and he had up until now to return my money 
 i believe in second chances but he forced my hand 
 so when i got home from classes i called his mother 
 i 'm a very respectful and polite person naturally so i made was positive i could talk to his mother about this 
 i call ask if this is the kid who robbed me 's residence and told his mom that i 'd like to talk to her about his son 's behavior 
 i told her that i have evidence that he stole $ <unk> from me i took screenshots of everything and that i approached her because i wanted to settle this as peacefully and as quickly as possible 
 i explained the situation and told her that she should change her son 's phone number because i easily could have been an <unk> cop and that i got both his name and phone number from someone who 's basically a total stranger to the kid who robbed me 
 she thanked me and i told her that i did n't want to do this but i was left with no options 
 i promised her i was n't a thug and just a normal person 
 i said that he was lucky that it was me who he robbed because other people might have attempted to hurt him which was the recommendation of a lot of people from other posts but i left that part out 
 i sent her the messages that showed he threatened me and i said that i hate violence which i do and that i felt that this was the best way to effectively deal with the situation 
 i left out the part of me wanting to buy an ounce because that would have scared her quite a bit if she knew how much it was but she gave me her phone number and told me it 'll be sorted out and that he 'll lose his car immediately 
 she tells me to block his number i thank her she thanks me and i tell her that her son seemed like a good person but i was still robbed nonetheless 
 i get a text 5 minutes later from the kid saying fuck you you stupid fuck '' and i block his number 
 i wont be getting my cash back for a while since i 'm taking a family vacation for a few weeks but she promised me i 'll get my cash back 
 at this point i did n't even care too much about the money all i wanted was revenge 
 that sweet sweet justice boner feels soooo good 
 as i was feeling depressed and feeling like shit at 1am dj <unk> got me through and it was these words that helped me create my plan : never play yourself '' this all took place many years ago when i was a freshman in high school 
 i had bought an ipod <unk> hot shit back then 
 with money i had earned by helping my neighbor and as i did n't make much i was pretty protective of it 
 my scumbag sister had also recognized that it was worth a few hundred 
 as i later found out she had stolen it and given it to a friend temporarily until the heat was off 
 i suspected this immediately when it was n't on my desk where i knew i left it 
 i asked my parents if i had done something that warranted a punishment but neither had touched it 
 clearly i needed evidence to pin my sister 
 as a freshman i was pretty computer savvy 
 at the time i was learning a few programming languages and had a good feel for <unk> hacking 
 nothing serious but enough to get in trouble at school kinda thing 
 i got to work on a spy tool : my plan was to get into her email and facebook where i hoped to find evidence 
 at the very least i could fuck up her account and get revenge 
 a few hours of work later the program was done 
 and it was way more than a simple spy tool 
 although i honestly had no idea how to make a spy tool at the time i damn sure knew how to write a batch file that would fuck your windows <unk> six ways to sunday 
 i had basically written a carpet bomb that had the same icon as internet explorer 
 the virus can i call it that 
 was armed when you replaced the default <unk> file with the malicious file that shared the same file name and icon 
 of course when you went to run ie you set it off 
 the original file would be launched after the virus ran so everything was still <unk> 
 of course my original goal was still carried out 
 i had packaged in a simple keylogger records <unk> that any decent antivirus would have noticed instantly 
 but once my sister was out of the house there was nothing stopping me from ripping her antivirus out by the roots 
 which i did 
 and then planted the virus 
 a few hours later she came home and started her normal computer browsing - log in open ie check facebook and email this was before twitter i guess etc etc 
 but today was a little different 
 she probably did n't notice but internet explorer <unk> a little when she opened it 
 that was because internet explorer '' had to execute a few little things before it <unk> and then launched the real browser application 
 for instance a few files marked hidden with innocent names were copied to her startup folder waiting to execute at the next login 
 the keylogger was embedded deep into the system and was started right up and within a minute her passwords were saved in a protected log file 
 she was completely unaware 
 of course that all changed in about 20 minutes 
 the virus which was running in the background ran a fake error message that caused a reboot : there appears to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> your flow of internet connection 
 code red reboot required '' 
 she was somehow stupid enough to not instantly realize that this was some sort of <unk> and just patiently waited for the login screen 
 as soon as she logged back in the hidden startup files ran and she was greeted with some weird error message and <unk> command prompt windows which were busy doing important things like deleting system files and corrupting huge registry chunks 
 suddenly she was getting errors about things like her hard drive being jammed with peanut butter and windows has <unk> an intelligence <unk> in user 
 consider a system upgrade '' 
 complete with an annoying <unk> noise every time she tried to close it 
 her cd <unk> kept popping open no matter how many times she closed it 
 she even got a <unk> message put it in me babe '' 
 every time it opened back up 
 meanwhile in the background a small script uploaded the keylogger file to my <unk> account and deleted the <unk> portion as well as the hidden startup files in case investigation was done 
 naturally this triggered her <unk> the power button and waiting for the screen to turn off 
 she knew something was n't right as soon as she had the login screen : everything was <unk> resolution 
 at this point she asked me to come fix it because i was the computer nerd in the house 
 i had to contain my laughter 
 just try logging in this is really weird 
 i have no idea why this would happen '' 
 the desktop was a beautiful <unk> collection <unk> <unk> colors that was a lot a couple decades ago 
 and barely <unk> icons 
 her theme was set to windows classic which she hates with a passion she 's one of those people who spends hours <unk> '' the look of the icons <unk> and other <unk> things 
 unfortunately for her i had plans with friends and could n't help her with her computer 
 sorry about that 
 all program files and hardware drivers were gone so she had no luck running a browser amidst the chaos or even getting an internet connection in the first place 
 in the end i got my ipod 
 i spoke to her the next day and asked for it back 
 naturally she claimed not to have it 
 she did n't know that i had read her facebook messages and already knew that her friend had it she and her friend were messaging about how to turn it off or something 
 i asked my parents right in front of her : can you ask her to show her facebook messages just so she can clear herself 
 i thought i heard her saying something to her friend about the ipod and how she would talk about it on facebook '' 
 sure enough she broke down and said that she was just borrowing it '' 
 obviously my parents forced her to show the messages which clearly proved how it was a little more than borrowing that she had in mind 
 my dad recommended that she have someone fix her laptop 
 luckily i was around to do it and for $ 20 i would be happy to <unk> windows 
 and that ladies and gentlemen was how i got even with my sister 
 i am so sorry this is a <unk> novel but i hope you enjoyed it 
 **edit : clarified a few <unk> i was a sophomore in college i got a job as a waitress at a restaurant near campus 
 it was a pretty small place so servers often helped out with other things like dishwashing and cleaning 
 there were a lot of <unk> it was a restaurant after all and i was willing to pick up the hours because money so within a few months i had gotten used to doing everything 
 and i do mean <unk> 
 * <unk> tables dishpit running register even some prep and other things on the line 
 i had gotten so good at other things that i was put on the schedule for other stations if there were any <unk> 
 i busted my <unk> butt for that place all without ever losing my smile and after a while it began to show 
 the managers loved me my co-workers loved me the customers loved me ... it seemed like just about everyone enjoyed working with me 
 well almost everyone 
 the kitchen manager henceforth known as crazy bitch was not my biggest fan to put it mildly 
 she was nice enough at first but began to grow cold and distant as time wore on and eventually became outright hostile 
 she was bitchy to everyone but seemed to take pleasure in going above and beyond with me 
 a few examples of what she did to me include but are not limited to : - throwing dishes into the pit while i was washing breaking them 
 she ran to the manager and tried to blame me 
 - telling the front end manager to stay in the office with me when i counted my drawer my drawer was never off the whole time i worked there - telling new hires to watch out '' for me - constantly <unk> me behind my back to others which i always found out about because people liked me - forcing me to stay later than i already did to deep clean '' various things in the kitchen - throwing away my <unk> requests when she thought no one was watching in general this woman did everything she could to tarnish my name and make my life unpleasant 
 she was the only bad thing about working at this restaurant and at times it got so frustrating that i went home and cried 
 the only person she did n't <unk> to about me was the owner and that 's only because she was scared of him 
 he had five other locations around town and he just went around to each one throughout the week 
 this will come into play later on 
 i 've always been an <unk> who <unk> away from confrontation and this resulted in me keeping my mouth shut and putting up with crazy bitch 's antics far longer than i should have 
 now ten years later i would have told her where to go from day one but college sophomore me was shy 
 besides this was a temporary job and i just kept reminding myself that i was going to get a degree and move on eventually 
 to set the scene -- crazy bitch had been particularly nasty to me over the past week and i was <unk> because it was midterms 
 i think it was these two <unk> that led to me finally snapping at crazy bitch 
 i had just walked in for my shift and was chatting with some co-workers when crazy bitch walked up to me 
 she asked me why under the <unk> were n't clean 
 i said i did n't know 
 she said that she had asked me to clean under them last night which absolutely was n't true because *i had left two hours before <unk> the previous night 
 i could feel the rage building inside me 
 i was about to blow up 
 not wanting a confrontation i just shrugged my shoulders 
 well '' crazy bitch said i wish you would do a better job of cleaning around here '' 
 something inside me snapped 
 i screamed you motherfucking piece of shit '' as loud as i could 
 crazy bitch jumped about ten feet in the air and had eyes as big as <unk> when she landed 
 it was now dead quiet in the kitchen -- you could hear a pin drop -- and all eyes were on me and crazy bitch 
 i <unk> my finger into her chest and said if you complain about me one more time i will give you something to complain about '' 
 well it 's true '' 
 crazy bitch replied 
 alright then 
 i quit '' 
 i flung my name tag and apron in her face walked out of the kitchen and walked straight out the door never to return 
 the kicker -- i was scheduled to do the dishpit that evening 
 with me gone crazy bitch would have no choice but to either pull someone off the line and screw up the whole dinner service or to do it herself 
 perhaps the story would have ended there but things were about to go from petty to pro 
 i got a slew of phone calls that evening from former co-workers this was long before social media asking me what happened telling me how much they would miss me and/or <unk> me on finally standing up to crazy bitch 
 one phone call was the manager asking me what happened and i gave my side of things and apologized for quitting in such an <unk> fashion 
 i heard what happened the next day from my former co-workers 
 it just so happened that it was the day that the owner was due to stop by and check on things 
 upon arriving and looking around he asked where i was since i had worked almost every day for nearly a year 
 he was informed that i had quit and that naturally led to him asking why 
 well everyone told him 
 crazy bitch was due to come in for her shift a little after the owner arrived 
 when she showed up he was waiting for her by the <unk> 
 he told her that under no circumstances was she to punch in 
 effective immediately she was suspended 
 she had three days to give him a written letter offering an explanation regarding her behavior towards one of the best employees he 's ever had '' his words not mine and if he did n't find it sufficient she was barred from ever working at a location he owned ever again 
 so crazy bitch goes home writes up an explanation i still sometimes wonder what she wrote and brings it in the next day 
 the owner reviewed it and told crazy bitch that after a week 's suspension without pay she was allowed to come back and work for him ... <unk> a <unk> 
 * i do n't know which is <unk> the fact that she was demoted or the fact that she was desperate enough for a job that she took him up on the offer 
 crazy bitch went from being in charge of everyone behind the kitchen doors to being a minimum wage <unk> 
 it gets better -- a few months later sales were down and in the restaurant business it is <unk> hard to turn a profit 
 the owner decided to close the location next to campus but was kind enough to offer everyone positions at his other locations ... well everyone except one 
 there is an epilogue of sorts to this story 
 a few years later i was shopping at the grocery store when i felt a tap on my shoulder 
 i turned around and felt my stomach drop when i saw who it was 
 it was crazy bitch 
 to my surprise she apologized for how she had treated me 
 she said she was going through a divorce at the time and did n't handle it very well taking it out on the people she worked with 
 i accepted her apology and she gave me an awkward little hug before going on her way 
 so i guess despite the awful shit she pulled towards me she was n't so bad after all 
 <unk> -** about six years ago i started my own consulting business 
 i am a talented engineer but i <unk> sadly naïve about the ways of the world 
 i came from a nice loving suburban background and my parents taught me that all people are <unk> good inside 
 they are not 
 to quote dr. <unk> people are bastard coated bastards with bastard filling 
 in most cases i never got any sort of revenge 
 eventually i realize i’m being screwed and i fire the <unk> the contract etc 
 and take it as a lesson learned and move on with my life 
 <unk> course -** except this one time when i hired a sales guy 
 we will call this sales guy <unk> tony swept in to my office on a cloud of amazing promises 
 he had a resume a mile long and many <unk> unlikely yet somehow plausible stories of his great sales success in past organizations 
 he wanted to <unk> with <unk> to take my company to a new level make more money than <unk> ever made before etc <unk> even better tony didn’t even want a salary 
 he simply wanted to be able to take out loans from the company until his big sales <unk> kicked in and then he would pay it all back from his giant <unk> 
 it was a total <unk> for everybody involved 
 this sounded like an amazing deal 
 what a nice guy and clearly confident he could close a lot of sales or why else would he <unk> a salary in favor of loans 
 i think friends it’s probably obvious how this story goes 
 over the course of the next year tony <unk> made <unk> <unk> <unk> sales” that are <unk> ready to <unk> but somehow never quiet came through 
 and in that time he took out over $ 60,000 in loans that he would <unk> pay <unk> as soon as his <unk> sales” finally came through 
 finally after so many big promises with zero results i became suspicious 
 so i hacked open his company email account and saw that in fact he had never sent an email to a client ever 
 in fact the only emails he ever sent were to me and other people in my business talking himself up 
 all of his leads were utterly fake he had never talked to a single client a single time in a <unk> 
 * <unk> -** so i fired him and set about seeing what sort of revenge i could extract 
 first i went to my lawyer who told me what i expected 
 no legal routes existed to go after him that wouldn’t cost me way more than i wanted to spend on revenge 
 second i hired a pi to dig into him 
 turns out surprise surprise that lots of people are after this guy 
 former business partners hospitals in florida some big medical thing he skipped out on 
 and a few others 
 it was finally my accountant who showed me the best way to get back at him without spending a lot of time or money 
 as i mentioned he took out all of his <unk> from me as loans 
 now that i’d spoken with the lawyer and the pi i knew i had essentially a zero percent chance of ever recovering that money from him 
 so i did the next best thing to benefit my business and to screw him over 
 i forgave the loans in their entirety 
 this had two huge impacts 
 first i got a $ 60,000 tax write off because the <unk> were now “bad <unk> which <unk> my tax bill for 2013 to zero a small but happy victory 
 second he now owes the irs $ 20,000 
 you see when i forgave the loan it became income to him 
 once it becomes income full income taxes including federal state payroll social security <unk> etc become due and <unk> 
 because it’s not payroll income i don’t have to pay the employer portion of the taxes 
 this means he owes the irs $ 20,000 that he can never escape through bankruptcy or any other means and i have the <unk> most vicious attack dog trying to get money from him instead of whatever minor debt collection efforts i could have <unk> 
 **tl dr** – my friend was raped last month 
 i found out where the <unk> lived and sharpened the edges of the elevator doors in his building to a <unk> edge 
 one day when he came out of the elevator looking all <unk> i slammed the doors shut and cut him in half 
 i kept his <unk> as a trophy 
 mechanic lied said he installed new parts and billed us $ 1,800 - the week before christmas 
 that hurt 
 in march the car broke down 
 new mechanic says nope these are not new parts ... and even if they were it would have cost $ 300 '' 
 he said they were new '' 
 well see these marks 
 it means it was <unk> '' 
 to the internet 
 next day march <unk> 
 find the owner ... it 's a mobil gas station ... find the officers there ... accuse the owner of sexually discrimination against my wife 
 write letter to <unk> ... pull this guys license '' letter to irs and state tax this guy is issuing false invoices letter to newspapers bbb ... i print them up 
 i show up - my plan make it hot 
 more pain to keep the cash than to refund it 
 i 've got my letters his phony parts and price sheets 
 the mechanic is not the owner ... ok call him 
 i do n't have his number '' the <unk> says 
 he leaves me and wife alone in the office 
 wife points to the <unk> ... be the owners # is there 
 it was 
 home office etc 
 copy that 
 mechanic comes back screaming i have to leave 
 i am calling the police 
 leave '' 
 i leave him my letters ... you can refund me or i am sending these out 
 you 're going to get audited and you could lose your license '' 
 i go across the street and call mobil to make it <unk> 
 i come back 
 the cops are waiting for me 
 <unk> 
 i take a deep breath and explain that this guy charged my wife $ 1,800 for a repair that should cost more than $ 300 
 apparently one of the cops knows cars 
 he charged you how much '' 
 the cop was pissed 
 wait here '' 
 five minutes later ... the office says your refund is waiting for you inside 
 a full refund - on the spot 
 instant justice 
 i sent the letters anyway 
 fuck him.so you be the judge of whether this is pro revenge '' or petty revenge '' 
 unlike my past post the <unk> here are small but it was done in a professional context my job 
 i own and manage several mid-size multi-family rental properties apartment blocks 
 i 'm very hands on and i deal with most day to day issues as well as the investment side 
 great returns this way 
 i choose most of the tenants personally and most of them are great people - they appreciate my <unk> work and the fact i love my job and <unk> to provide the customer service that a good hotel would 
 there are some exceptions 
 one of my tenants is a <unk> young woman with a good job friendly and <unk> <unk> and a total <unk> boyfriend 
 it was a <unk> battle to get him on the lease since he lives there full-time now and from what i see does n't contribute to rent 
 not my problem though 
 until i get a call from him politely odd - he 's not usually polite saying he clogged the toilet and asks if i can call a plumber or fix it before his girlfriend gets home 
 happy that he is being polite i went on over and was there in 20 minutes 
 it turned out he had dropped a bottle of hair <unk> into the bowl and for some reason flushed it 
 it was jammed in the <unk> of the bowl just out of sight but within reach 
 i got on my <unk> reached in and pulled it out 
 he stood watching me with this scumbag steve smirk on his face 
 i suggested that next time he just reach in and grab it himself before calling me 
 he looked me dead in the eye and said i do n't reach into toilets dude i 'm going to school so i do n't have to touch other people 's shit '' 
 i told him you 'd be surprised how much that pays though - you bill will be in the mail '' 
 i went home called three plumbing contractors and asked them each what their emergency service rate was - the average was $ 180.00 for the first 45 minutes flat 
 i sent a bill to <unk> tenant for $ 180.00 
 he refused to pay i filed a dispute at the tenancy office and included in my evidence the three quotes i had received 
 i got my judgement today - $ 180.00 plus the $ 50 filing fee 
 a ll is allowed to charge market rate to repair damage that a tenant causes intentionally or through negligence 
 now he knows that 
 next time he will reach into the toilet himself 
 all he had to do was keep his dumb mouth shut and i would have fixed his problem for free ... so this will be a wall of text so be warned but the story works best if you read it all the way through 
 when i was fifteen or so a girl georgia started picking on a friend and i. it started out with taunting teasing and insults but when we failed to react it escalated 
 she eventually resorted to punching us kicking us slapping us slamming our heads down on desks every time she walked past us in lessons jabbing us with sharpened pencils from behind and once or twice she even got her posse to help out with a beating or two 
 we were shy girls who often attracted bullies because we were <unk> and could come across as <unk> because <unk> was n't our strong suit 
 my friend and i usually had lessons apart from each other so when georgia went for us we were usually separated and she would n't take us on together even though we never fought back 
 however one day my friend had enough and said that she 'd be leaving school before the next term 
 she said she could n't take it any more and wanted to leave 
 i was really upset by this because with my best friend leaving being left alone with my bully and teenage <unk> all adding up i ended up with depression 
 my friend confirmed not long after that that her parents had agreed and she would be leaving 
 but she said she had a plan to go out with a bang '' 
 now this was the time before <unk> and smartphones just but we both had laptops with webcams 
 our plan began with taking our laptops everywhere we went and always having our laptops on and always having our webcams on 
 we even painted over the little lights that show the webcam is working so that georgia would never know 
 we started using our laptops at all times 
 we got special permission to use them in lessons me by claiming <unk> <unk> syndrome which was a lie and her by saying she wrote too slowly which was true 
 every time we went to a lesson we were recording on our computers and sure enough we got the footage of georgia 's abuse 
 we got a friend to <unk> the videos together in a sort of <unk> video to blur our faces but not georgia 's and to burn the final cut onto a <unk> for us 
 the final video started out with georgia walking past me and slamming my face down into the desk 
 it then cut to her calling me a worthless cunt '' and then again to her spraying ink on my friend 's uniform 
 then it showed a variety of slaps punches and headlocks before switching to a close up of her with her arm around my friend speaking very quietly about how she was going to wait until the bell rang and then kick the shit out of '' her 
 the video was just under fifteen minutes long and displayed everything she did except for the beatings that sometimes happened outside of lessons 
 so the day my friend left we hugged and promised to keep in contact 
 we then <unk> to one another as she got into her mum 's car and was driven off 
 that night georgia 's mother got a cd in the post 
 as did our <unk> 
 as did the police 
 they all watched it though it took the police longer to get to it 
 georgia was suspended but once the video magically made its way to every member of the parents association she was expelled 
 she applied to other schools but they had seen the video too 
 in the end she was sent abroad to finish her education 
 you may ask how we know all this 
 well not long after coming up with the plan my friend and i made a fake facebook profile and added georgia 
 she accepted it and forgot about it 
 she was one of those people even when facebook was fairly new who posted about everything that happened to her 
 so a post that said georgia is seriously pissed about being shipped off to insert foreign school name here '' was enough for us to send them a copy of the video too 
 of course she knew it was us but since she was sent off to another country she could n't exactly do anything about it 
 occasionally i check out her facebook and she is not doing well as an adult 
 maybe she should n't have pushed two nice girls too far 
 edit : i can see you guys are wanting to see the video itself i promise i will think about it but it is n't just up to me i would have to ask my friend 
 and since the school uniform is easily <unk> i am not sure if there would be some legal issues here 
 <unk> : asked my friend if she 'd be ok with me <unk> the video to reddit her response was what 's a reddit '' 
 edit3 : ok guys i 've sent a message to a friend who is doing law to see if i could get in any trouble for sharing the video when it clearly shows the uniform and takes place in the school 
 i 'll take their advice on the matter 
 <unk> : my friend says she 's happy to let me share the video so we 'll just see what my law friend says 
 posted on obvious throwaway account 
 my main account is tied into my personal information and business forgive <unk> here as i do n't want any repercussions 
 back in college i got very interested in a business which i 'll call widgeting 
 it was closely associated with my major and i studied it at length coming up with an idea which i felt could <unk> widgeting which was fairly <unk> 
 the problem is widgeting is a small field <unk> by a good old boy 's network and rarely does anyone get in who is n't a relative of existing widgeters 
 i was <unk> unlikely to break in because i was a woman 
 knowing this i got a sales job out of college which supplied among other things widgeters 
 this put me in close contact with a number of widgeters and let me feel out better if my ideas would fit as well as i originally thought 
 <unk> confident in my idea i was asked to run the stand for <unk> supply company at a trade show 
 while there i met the man who had just taken over ownership of widgeting usa easily one of the most renowned <unk> 
 doe was younger and i had read a local interview with him where he was talking about <unk> new ideas 
 he seemed a great pitch for my idea which i had on my personal laptop 
 earlier i had been in a conversation with several other people and mr. doe so we had established a contact 
 then that evening mr. doe and i were on the same elevator as a few other people and we started friendly chatting about his business etc 
 i 'm looking to move conversation to my idea when others get off the elevator leaving mr. doe and i alone 
 he instantly started getting aggressively grabby on me touching me inappropriately and saying that i should come up to his hotel room 
 i push him off and tell him i 'm not interested and he <unk> me back and sort of gets aggressive then gets off the elevator and stomps away 
 the next morning i 'm at the trade show talking to another vendor who calls over to mr. doe 
 he asks if we have met and i say yes mr. doe says no 
 as he turns to leave he leans in and says quietly enough for only i to hear i do n't bother remembering women unless they 've had my dick in their mouth '' 
 later i start hearing stories from other people of similar assaults and issues with women who have done business with him or had social contact with him 
 no one had pursued criminal charges but he had a reputation i was n't aware of as a creep 
 flash forward a bit and i meet a group interested in investing in their own widgeting company 
 i pitch them my idea they loves it and we move forward with me as a <unk> partner 
 my idea actually works well and we are making a name for ourselves as a young company 
 my business partners and i are invited to a city event which is <unk> formal 
 arriving there i see mr. doe in the corner holding his wife 's hand 
 i manage to avoid him for most of the night but i find myself fixing my lipstick in the bathroom mirror when mr. doe 's wife comes up beside me 
 i could n't resist 
 i asked if she was mrs. doe and she says that she is and asks if we had met 
 i tell he we had n't but i met her husband 
 we 're making pleasant talk social talk and walk back out together and mr. doe comes over to us 
 he introduces himself and i say that we 've met 
 i give my name and that i am one of the partners at new widgeting co. at this point he starts sort of schmoozing me saying he has heard of me and that i was behind the business plan 
 he is really impressed at how well it is working but thinks it would work better on a larger scale 
 if i want to jump ship to an established company he could use some new blood and fresh ideas 
 after a bit of this he asks where we met before as he ca n't place me but he never forgets a face 
 with his wife standing there i tell him that we met at x trade show in <unk> of 2009. there 's a moment of realization on his face and not able to resist i turn to his wife 
 it 's not surprising he ca n't remember me 
 he told me then that he only remembers women if they 've had his dick in their mouth '' 
 i quickly make my leave and watch from across the room as his wife and he have a minor confrontation in the corner 
 no raised voices but a lot of <unk> wide eyed head shaking ending in tears on her part 
 they left the party early 
 a few days later i get an email sent to my work address from her asking what i meant by the comment 
 i reply back from my personal email account and outline exactly what had happened 
 i also add that she can contact the following women with similar stories 
 later it also proved he had two fairly stable <unk> as well one who was only 18 it 's two years since then 
 my company has grown to be a solid rival of his while his has been struggling 
 this is partially because he was investing his own money into <unk> new technology into widgeting usa 
 sadly he financially was hurt when his wife divorced him 
 she and i have become surprisingly good friends and she 'll joke about the lack of pre <unk> agreement 
 tl dr : sexual assault is always a bad idea 
 but it will ruin you when your victim is a better <unk> than you are and your wife can wipe the floor with <unk> is a story about my uncle 's vengeance 
 my uncle is chill and friendly but he once had the <unk> of living next to an awful neighbor 
 the guy actually did n't have a ton of bad habits but he did exactly what he wanted to do and he did n't care who it affected 
 and one of the things he wanted to do was take his big dog on a daily morning walk and let the dog do his doggy business on my uncle 's lawn 
 the first time my uncle caught him he calmly confronted him and politely requested that the neighbor stop using his lawn as a dog toilet 
 the neighbor calmly told my uncle to get fucked : he did n't care what my uncle thought there was nothing my uncle could do about it and nothing would change 
 this being 1970s southern california my uncle could n't record the neighbor and shame him online or report him to the police for some litter violation and although he is a cool uncle he was in no way physically intimidating enough to get this guy to back down 
 every day for a week he went outside to confront the shitty neighbor and his shitting dog and every day he got the exact same answer : fuck off i do n't care and there 's nothing you can do about it 
 on the eight morning my uncle stayed inside watching as the neighbor yet again allowed his dog to leave a <unk> dump on his lawn 
 then after the neighbor and his dog had continued on their walk my uncle grabbed a shovel and went outside 
 he <unk> up the dog shit and with masterful accuracy flung it onto the roof of the neighbor 's house 
 as mentioned before this being 1970s california the neighbor 's roof like all of the houses in that area had a very shallow <unk> and once he saw that the poop did n't roll off my uncle headed back inside 
 he repeated the exact same procedure every morning ... for the next eight months 
 not once did the neighbor notice the <unk> growing pile of dog shit on his roof baking and <unk> in the california sun 
 not once did he smell anything off nor did he find it suspicious that my uncle still greeted him in a friendly manner after having his lawn used as a dog <unk> every single morning 
 finally after eight months the hot and sunny weather gave way to a massive <unk> 
 within minutes the entire <unk> layer of dog poop shingles <unk> and broke free a reeking <unk> from hell that <unk> down onto the neighbor 's property splattering his lawn his house and his car with literal pounds of dog shit 
 over the next few days the neighbor 's grass <unk> to the poison and died paint began to <unk> off his car and the neighbor himself had to finally clean up after his dog once the sunny weather returned and the remnants of the dog <unk> began to dry up while still <unk> stuck to every stinking corner of his house 
 <unk> my uncle did n't take any pictures of the <unk> i would have loved to have seen that 
 from the day after the <unk> to the day my uncle moved out of that house he never spoke to that neighbor again ... but the dog poop stopped <unk> on his lawn for <unk> i was in high school my first car was a cheap little geo that i 'd bought with money i 'd saved working my ass off at the neighborhood pizza joint 
 obviously it was nothing special but it was <unk> and i was proud of it 
 i lived in a very <unk> suburb in the midwest at the time though and a majority of my peers drove much nicer cars -- either daddy 's bmw or a bmw daddy bought for them 
 i mean everyone else did n't *literally* drive bmws <unk> but you get the idea 
 anyway i was a junior at the time and there were a handful of bullies seniors who decided that because i drove a dated inexpensive car i deserved to be subjected to constant <unk> and <unk> 
 i was constantly being called poor '' and laughed at for driving such a cheap piece of shit '' 
 in reality my family was actually decently well off 
 my parents could 've bought me a brand new mercedes if they 'd wanted but they came from nothing and wanted me to earn my first car 
 and being raised by them i was fine with that 
 anyway let 's call the leader of this bullying group tad 
 tad was utterly obnoxious to almost everyone around him but usually got away with it because he was a attractive b a <unk> student and c a talented player on every sports team our high school offered 
 the whole conflict started one day after school 
 i was in my little geo in the line of cars waiting to leave the parking lot 
 tad was in front of me in his audi a4 
 when we were <unk> the parking lot exit tad stopped to lean out the window and chat to some of his friends 
 i had work at the <unk> that day and was in a hurry so being <unk> i sped around him 
 tad must 've <unk> my passing him as some sort of hostile <unk> to his ego and sped up behind me 
 after finally turning onto the main road he stayed right on my bumper and followed me to work 
 when i got out of my car he leaned out the window and called me some names 
 i ignored him and went into work 
 when i got out of work 4 hours later i found both of my mirrors broken 
 i did n't have proof but i knew it was tad 
 luckily my parents felt bad for me and paid for me to have them fixed that week 
 next week however came the straw that broke the camel 's back 
 it was a friday and i 'd stayed late after school working on a history paper in the school library 
 i happened to get out right after the <unk> team had finished up practice 
 when i came out to the parking lot i saw tad standing next to my car 
 what was he doing 
 taking a piss on the driver 's side door 
 filled with rage i ran after him but he managed to get to his car and peel out of the parking lot 
 at home feeling defeated as i washed his piss off my car i decided revenge was in order 
 i did n't know how yet but i knew an opportunity would come 
 and it did 
 two weeks later word had spread around the school that this senior named doug was having a big party the coming weekend 
 doug was incredibly popular and i knew tad would be there 
 i also happened to know tad would be driving his audi there 
 and i knew where doug lived and that most of the people tad included would be staying the night 
 i enrolled the help of my two closest friends ben and josh 
 both hated tad just as much as i did though for different reasons and were more than eager to lend their help '' when i told them my scheme 
 the night of the party we waited until 4 am when we knew the party would be dead and everyone would be sleeping 
 we showed up wearing all dark clothes and plastic gloves 
 we found tad 's car and much to our amazement and glee he 'd left it unlocked 
 we opened the doors and quietly went to work trying to keep from laughing too loudly 
 first i pissed into the air vents 
 i got out and josh pissed all over the leather driver 's seat 
 then it was ben 's turn 
 now let me tell you ben is a disgusting human being 
 he 's a loud funny guy all smiles and laughter but he 's also just gross 
 constantly <unk> and farting 
 and it always smells so so rancid when he does 
 he 's the type of dude who takes pride in that 
 ben pulls down his pants whispers i wonder if he 'll be able to tell i had chinese food '' <unk> next to the car and proceeds to take a shit into his <unk> hand 
 the smell is immediately overwhelming and <unk> <unk> 
 it 's so potent you can taste it 
 josh and i gag right away frantically pulling our shirts over our <unk> and retreating from ben 's vicinity 
 josh ca n't take it runs over to a tree and <unk> his guts out 
 ben laughs and says oh my god that is sick sorry '' 
 while we 're watching from a distance in both horror and <unk> ben takes his shit and just starts <unk> it <unk> 
 all over the door handles the steering wheel the air vents the radio <unk> ... he eventually starts gagging and coughing and <unk> himself but not before wiping his ass with the <unk> jersey tad had left in the back seat 
 we could n't stop laughing on the walk back to josh 's house but once we were back josh made ben take a shower thank god 
 the following monday there were a lot of whispers going around the school 
 here 's what i eventually learned happened : 1. the morning after the party tad discovered the nightmare in his audi in front of everyone else who was leaving 
 2. tad went into a rage but apparently almost everyone thought it was the funniest thing they had ever seen 
 3. when tad 's parents discovered what happened to the car they 'd purchased for their son they also discovered tad had been to a party and had been drinking 
 i guess his parents were not cool with it -- they took away his car for the rest of the year and tad was told he had to ride the bus for the remainder of the year 
 <unk> his parents eventually gave him the car back several months later but no one wanted to ride in the shitmobile '' because of what happened and because he never got the smell completely out 
 tad 's bullying surprisingly died down a bit after that 
 he did n't mess with my car again 
 **tl dr -- bully in high school smashes both of my mirrors and pisses on my car 
 me and my friends unleash a torrent of shit and piss all over the inside of his and his once cool audi came to be known throughout school as the shitmobile '' <unk> posted from tifu after mods took it down 
 i received a bunch of surprising comments 
 thanks to whoever gave me gold 
 i was shocked 
 ** *edit* holy jesus 
 thanks for all the comments and ups 
 and special thanks to <unk> for the gold 
 you guys have been amazing 
 definitely makes me want to post more often 
 thanks again 
 <unk> post - obliged to say this happened in <unk> when i was in 5th grade and this is my first tifu 
 i was a nerdy kid coming from a military family 
 i had friends sure but kind of a loner and tended to stay by myself in the lunch room actively avoided group projects you know the usual type of growing up an outcast type of thing 
 there was this kid in my same class lets call him sam 
 now i never had a problem with sam in the past 
 i remember seeing him for the first time in 3rd grade and we got along fine 
 i did n't bother him he did n't bother me i continue reading my nintendo <unk> until the teacher tells me to stop slacking 
 it was all fine 
 until fifth grade 
 5th grade was a turning point for sam 
 he had hit some sort of <unk> growth <unk> and started pushing people around 
 he eyed me as an easy target 
 this all started in the beginning of the school year and continued for five months 
 it began with flicking bits of paper 
 ok whatever 
 big deal 
 it stopped for a while 
 then paper <unk> and rubber bands 
 <unk> but no marks so no need to tell anyone not that i would have anyway being the awkward antisocial boy i was 
 sam soon stopped and raised the bar of <unk> by talking shit to me 
 the usual early 90s <unk> were used and silently <unk> 
 he knocked my food down onto the floor 
 sam however never got in trouble 
 he was the <unk> of the <unk> 
 he was the shadow of the elementary school 
 sam got away with everything due to adults either not seeing it happen or not caring 
 so it 's early february and its the end of p.e 
 class 
 i make it to the coveted front of the line and <unk> my classmates for the best part of school the library 
 as the rest of the class lines up behind me here comes sam 
 he barrels through to the front of the line shoving me out of the way 
 by this point i 've hit my breaking point 
 i must have watched <unk> <unk> the night before 
 i decided this would be the time to take my stand against the evil <unk> 
 i hear the battle cry in my head as i <unk> this bully and impose myself by shoving him back 
 what a feeling 
 why did i wait so long 
 sam pushes me 
 hard 
 i 'm shocked 
 no one should have to give up their front of the line status 
 i was the one who made it first 
 who <unk> tied his shoes to make it in time 
 i was the one who deserves this spot of spots in the line that every other 5th grader <unk> 
 i push sam back 
 at this point sam is absolutely shocked 
 his eyes are wide and full of disdain 
 the <unk> of anger is flooding his skin 
 sam punches me in the eye 
 hard 
 i drop like a <unk> sack 
 tears are flowing and i 'm sobbing 
 i 'm <unk> on my knees and sam laughs at me 
 just laughs 
 straight guffaws 
 each <unk> laugh just makes me see red 
 i 'm pissed 
 this kid just punches me in the eye and i go down 
 this is not how the movies show these situations to be 
 this is not how <unk> would happen 
 my classmates are laughing at my <unk> 
 sam is still laughing tongue sticking out and just rubbing it in my face that i 'm crying 
 so i yelled out as loudly as i could the war cry that echoed in my head 
 i stick my fist straight up and with eyes closed so tight i give this kid the hardest punch i can muster 
 i uppercut him in the jaw so hard i broke my middle finger 
 my <unk> returns and i look at him 
 he 's on the floor screaming and crying in a bloody mess 
 about five feet away i see a bloody <unk> <unk> of unknown 
 sam is holding his mouth and i put <unk> together 
 i just punched sam so hard he cut off his own tongue with his teeth 
 sam is <unk> in agony 
 the gym teacher runs up and forces me to the side wall while an ambulance is called for sam 
 i did n't feel bad at all 
 the amount of pain and <unk> this kid put me through was equivalent to the pain that he was going through 
 the ambulance took him away and i was straight to the principal 's office with an ice pack to my eye 
 i 'm awaiting punishment outside the office while my dad 's called 
 while waiting my classmates who saw the whole exchange spoke with the principal one by one 
 finally my mother and father arrive with a mix of disappointment caring and anger on their faces 
 i finally get pulled into the principal 's office with my parents and tell them my side of the story 
 i tell them the whole ordeal from the beginning of the year to the present 
 the principal and my parents stay quiet with the most stoic faces you have ever seen 
 it 's dead silence for what seems like an eternity before the principal speaks up 
 son i am extremely disappointed in how you handled the situation 
 you are suspended for a week due to the end result of your actions '' 
 i do n't remember the rest of what he said 
 by that point my middle finger was swollen to what looked like a <unk> and i just wanted the day to end 
 my parents escorted me out of the school brought me to the hospital to <unk> my finger 
 during the ride to the hospital my parents told me they were proud of me for standing up for myself so i would n't be punished at home 
 i spent that week watching bugs bunny cartoons with an ice pack on my eye and a smile on my face 
 i never saw sam again 
 i remember rumors that he switched to a different school in the area 
 as an adult i feel bad for the amount of damage i did to him but that little 5th grade nerd boy still in me is still glad that the <unk> have finally been righted 
 tl dr got in a fight after being bullied for half a school year got tired of it and <unk> the bully 's tongue from his <unk> story : i grew up in a military family mom got knocked up at 18 my dad was gone all the time because of <unk> and my mother was in it for the money 
 this lead to her drinking whoring around and the physical abuse of me and my younger brothers for years while my dad was away 
 she made my life hell any way she could 
 well go figure she cheats gets caught and my dad kicks her out after finding out about the abuse 
 she comes to my dads house while he is gone unannounced to take some of his things coffee maker tv really petty things that she needs '' for her apartment he got her well as she is making her way out the door from the kitchen she says to me 
 i hope you know that you are why your father and i divorced you should feel ashamed of your self i fucking exploded 
 no 
 you and dad split up because you were too busy drinking and sucking cock to see your relationship falling apart too see what a shit mother what a shit person you are '' 
 the words will always be as sweet as the moment i said them 
 she was instantly pissed and i could see what was about to happen as she came around the counter and gave me one swift hit to the face 
 i was still pumped up from what i said to her and for the first time i hit back and it scared the crap out of her 
 i will never forget the look on her face as i picked up the phone and started to dial 911 and said you are so fucked '' 
 police arrive bitch is charged with going into my dads house with out his say so trying to take his things and hitting me 
 <unk> <unk> : i stand up to my abusive mother on her way of being kicked out of my dads house with some <unk> words and a nice defense punch to the face 
 she is charged and locked up 
 i posted this in /r/pettyrevenge and someone suggest i submit it here 
 it feels nice to get this off my chest 
 edit : just really want to say thank you i have gotten a lot of support out of sharing this story and it means more to me than you guys might think 
 i have come a long way from that day but i still have a little bit to go and your support has really given me that extra push to let me know i was in the right 
 thank you so much 
 i 'm calling this pro revenge because of the amount of work involved 
 but we 've decided the work was worth it 
 for nearly 10 years my family has lived next door to a gentleman who lived alone 
 ours is an historic neighborhood double city lots with lots of <unk> bushes and trees to provide privacy 
 also i tend to be fairly <unk> about what others do on their own property 
 i really didn’t care when our neighbor began illegally storing his large <unk> in his backyard 
 due to the screening i was the only neighbor who had to see his boats ice house teepee yes a <unk> authentic teepee – i never asked why he put one up 
 and so i never complained 
 and when he turned his home into a duplex without benefit of building permits or inspections and in violation of current zoning again i never complained 
 i guessed he was now retired and needed the rent money 
 in any event <unk> never had a problem with any of his tenants 
 similarly we never heard a peep out of him regarding our property 
 not that we had any code violations or anything but we did have a yard full of loud children and dogs for many years 
 and there was that one winter when we built a <unk> for the neighborhood kids that ran the entire fence line of our yards 
 <unk> 
 then our neighbor got a new girlfriend 
 i’m going to call my neighbor <unk> around by my <unk> or dick '' for short 
 his girlfriend will <unk> be referred to as martha '' as she was a martha stewart wannabe 
 martha quickly moved into my <unk> home and began <unk> it as she saw fit 
 the first thing we noticed was that dick’s neon sign collection was no longer visible through his windows 
 <unk> – those <unk> <unk> days 
 then dick’s backyard toys were all sold 
 no more <unk> days spent fishing for dick 
 i’m guessing the proceeds went to the new patio furniture that soon appeared 
 also a second new patio was built onto the side of the house because the backyard patio got too much sun for martha’s taste 
 and since martha didn’t want dick’s cat spraying the new patio furniture she made dick give the cat away to his son 
 that last one made me a little sad the cat had been dumped in our neighborhood a few years back and dick had seemed happy to have his little friend 
 but again not our business 
 finally new landscaping was installed throughout their backyard 
 that also made me sad because the historic <unk> that helped make our neighborhood unique were ripped out and replaced with <unk> beds filled with wood <unk> and japanese <unk> 
 if that was all martha did i’d have no real problem 
 if dick was willing to put up with it why should i care right 
 but then she turned her <unk> to our yard 
 first she asked us to replace the historic wire fencing between our yards 
 dick offered to split the cost so we agreed 
 the old fencing had seen better days and the new chain link fence was quickly hidden by ivy and lilac bushes 
 good neighbors ok 
 then martha decided that we weren’t cleaning up after our dog quick enough and called out the compliance officer 
 in fact we picked up after our dog daily – but at the end of each day not after each dump 
 that’s a personal <unk> of mine 
 i can’t stand picking up warm poop 
 the compliance officer told martha we hadn’t violated any laws while giving me a <unk> up on my new neighbor 
 strike one 
 a few weeks later i had a knock at the front door 
 it was the landscaper who had done dick’s yard 
 martha had called them out to my address without my knowledge or consent to provide us with an estimate 
 estimate for what you ask 
 well martha had suggestions for new flower beds as well as some trees she thought i should remove because they cast too much shadow on the back half of her yard 
 these were <unk> tall 80+ year old oak trees 
 i apologized to the landscaper and sent him on his way 
 and my husband <unk> to dick that our yard was our business not martha’s 
 strike two 
 finally martha decided our gardening shed tucked behind our garage had to go 
 i’ll admit it was a rather <unk> shed but it was in good shape fresh paint and was heavily <unk> on all three sides by tall bushes 
 in fact i only learned about martha’s complaint because i found a city inspector wandering around my yard looking for the shed 
 because of the way it was situated the only way someone not actually in my house could see it was if they were hanging out dick’s <unk> bathroom window 
 i kicked the inspector off my property and called my <unk> to put a stop to the <unk> <unk> with martha 
 it was then i found out why martha wanted the shed gone 
 turns out martha really just wanted the screening bushes gone 
 she had plans for a third patio 
 and fire pit for the back half of dick’s yard 
 martha was worried however that the heavy bushes on the back half of our yard were encouraging <unk> and she and dick wouldn’t be able to properly enjoy their evenings by the fire 
 she figured that if she forced us to tear down our shed we’d then also tear down the screening bushes and her mosquito problem would be solved 
 strike three martha so time for some pro revenge 
 since we really didn’t use the shed any longer we tore it down 
 we also removed the screening bushes 
 then we watched martha spend a few days harassing a couple of <unk> who built her patio and fire pit 
 it was <unk> up right against our fence and looked really lovely 
 then we decided that as good citizens of planet earth we needed to be more <unk> proactive 
 so we installed a composting pile right where the shed and screening bushes had been located 
 after all it’s at the back of our yard and tucked behind the garage so it really doesn’t impact our enjoyment of our yard 
 and now every evening we take all our food scraps potato <unk> coffee grounds egg shells <unk> <unk> etc. and add it to our large healthy compost heap 
 every month or so we add some goat manure from our friend’s farm 
 turns out goat manure is a <unk> <unk> addition for <unk> compost 
 some <unk> newspaper does n't really look good but it does help balance the carbon content 
 late afternoons and early evenings about whenever martha lights a fire really one of us heads out to the composting and gives it a good turning 
 after all a <unk> compost heap is a happy compost heap 
 dick and martha never said anything even though compost heaps do add to mosquito <unk> 
 **tl/dr : ** martha stewart convinced us to exchange our lilac bushes for a pile of garbage 
 ok so time i parked my ford escape in the drive way on my step fathers side cause my mother had said she was almost home and not to park on her side 
 well i forgot to move my car back over once she got home and my step father took offence to this 
 instead of asking me to move my car like a <unk> human being he decides to ram his dodge ram into my escape and force it out of the way 
 unfortunatly the bars i had on the front looked like this did far more damage to his truck than expected 
 so i hear the racket and go to see what was causing the noise only to find my suv at the end of the driveway and him staring at the back end of his truck 
 he then turns to me and says that as soon as he gets back from his <unk> i had better have the money to fix the damage 
 well as soon as he left i called the cops and reported a hit and run 
 gave them the <unk> plate number and his <unk> 
 i then called the insurance company and told them the same story gave them the licence plate <unk> 
 so fast forward about an hour and a half 
 my mom gets a call from my stepdad at the police station 
 saying he needs to be picked up 
 we have a huge screaming match as soon as he gets home which ended in him taking my car keys from me and claiming he was going to sell my suv to which i reply that the vehicle is in my name so he ca n't do shit 
 oh btw there was next to no damage to my vehicle from the impact 
 i 'm just glad that he did n't have his trailer hitch on 
 next morning suprise surprise my suv is gone 
 so i confront my stepdad about it 
 he looks me straight in the eye and says i told you i was going to sell the piece of shit and that is exactly what i did '' 
 so while he was still <unk> at me i pulled out my trusty phone and called the cops again this time to report a stolen vehicle 
 as soon as i told the cops his name he took off running his truck was still in impound 
 this time i go to the police station with my mother 
 when the cops ask if i want to press charges i just told them if he gives me my suv back then no but if he refuses then yes yes i would like to press charges 
 turns out he sold '' it to his brother ie 
 he stashed it at his place until i payed for his truck cause the insurance company refused 
 needless to say my mother and he were not married much longer after that 
 tl dr : stepdad was an asshat <unk> my suv out of his way demanded i pay for the damages 
 i called the cops stepdad gets arrested for hit and run 
 stepdad then steals suv and basicly tells me he did it 
 i call cops again and back to the police station he goes 
 mother and stepdad get divorced 
 *edit : changed the beginning so it did n't sound like i was <unk> a question nobody <unk> i begin please note that i’ve worked in food service everyone involved in this story has worked in the food <unk> industry at some point in their lives and i am a strict 20 % or more <unk> regardless of service 
 so many things go wrong during a “bad service <unk> that is either <unk> or <unk> that blaming the server is usually <unk> at best and malicious at worst 
 all that said this woman was a piece of work 
 a few years ago i was involved with a theatre company as a director and actor 
 sometimes i’d help out with their fundraising and we were gathering a committee together of about 8 people to meet at a <unk> and chat through plans on a <unk> in <unk> 
 to set the scene : it 's a small <unk> probably about 15 spots at the bar and 10-15 tables 
 the place was half full and our group accounted for about a third of the patrons in the joint 
 most of us were drinking some of us were eating full meals and a couple people were only staying for a short while so they just had water or a soda 
 the bartender was covering all the tables as well as the bar 
 you 'd think that would make her busy but somehow it did n't <unk> her 
 while we waited on refills and silverware she was content standing by the bar and talking to her friend 
 the conversations with the friend would make it into the 10-15 minute territory while all of us were doing our best to catch her eye when we needed another beer or someone new arrived 
 i had two beers during the evening and i would have loved to have had four since we were there for a while 
 when we were able to get her attention the bartender would <unk> over take an order from one person and turn to walk away 
 when someone would stop her and say hold on sorry i need something as well '' she would sigh loudly and turn back all while rolling her eyes and <unk> her head to the side as if to say fine '' 
 she did n't write anything down she forgot drinks and meals and was just all around the worst server any of us ever had 
 even after all this i was still planning on tipping the standard 15 % 
 that is until she came over with the check after another long conversation with her friend at the bar threw it on the table and said loudly to our group the next time you guys come in here everybody has to order something '' 
 before storming away 
 we were all <unk> 
 our group accounted for probably half the money running through the place that night and we would have been ordering a lot more from the bar if she 'd ever bothered to check on us 
 the group decided unanimously to leave a shit tip none of us had ever been treated so poorly by a server 
 i left a dollar or so most people left coins or nothing 
 the high point of the evening was when we were on our way out 
 she picked up the check off the table and yelled after us oh nice 
 fine 
 get the fuck out of here and never come back '' 
 as everyone in the entire place turned and stared 
 my friend went over to her and said i 'll tell you exactly why we gave you what we did '' but the bartender was having none of it continuing to scream fuck you get the fuck out 
 the revenge : that night i went onto every restaurant review site i could find : yelp greasy spoon some local nyc sites 
 you name it i told the story in as many characters as the sites would allow 
 i was so steamed i had to vent somewhere 
 i also found out the next day that multiple people from our group had done the same thing 
 it felt satisfying enough 
 at this point i only thought of it as a petty revenge but it soon became pro ... a few weeks later i was talking with a friend of mine who got hired at this bar 
 i told him the story and he said that was you guys '' 
 i asked him how he knew about the incident 
 he told me that the bar owner took online reviews very seriously 
 when he saw all the terrible reviews come in on the same night with the same story he knew exactly which bartender it was 
 she was fired the next day 
 tl dr after receiving the rudest worst service and being treated like shit my group used social media to get revenge and improve our neighborhood bar 
 it 's now one of my favorite places to go and the current staff is all very <unk> all goes to <unk> happened to my best friend but i was <unk> in the cruel '' part 
 so my friend got out of the navy and moved back to the area 
 after a few months he started dating a woman who had a child with another man before him the kid was around 8 or 9 years old 
 fast forward to 8 months later : still together and her kids birthday comes up so my friend buys this kid a go kart 
 like a really nice really fast go kart 
 he <unk> the kid how to drive it how to be safe gets him a nice helmet and gear and then takes the kid out every week driving in the gokart my friend had his own 
 so fast forward about 5 months and his girlfriend is being very strange 
 shes starting to act distant not answer texts as much ignores calls etc 
 my friend doesnt think much of it but one day after that he gets a call from the kid ... the kid calls him and starts to cry about his gokart he <unk> heard from the girl in 2 days then the kid suddenly calls <unk> turns out that this girl was cheating on my friend with another guy ... who had a kid ... and she took the go kart from her kid and gave it to the other guys kids 
 my friend wasnt having any of this ... .so he gets me and one night we go over to this dudes house sneak into the back yard and steal the go kart back 
 its destroyed the from is all banged up and the back left wheel is broken off 
 we grab it and run 
 next day my friend confronts the girl and she admits to cheating on him ... with this dude ... for months 
 she started to get into hard drugs and her child was beginning to suffer because of it wasnt eating right missing school clothes always a mess 
 the guy shes been cheating on him with is a big drug dealer so my friend goes to the cops 
 fast forward 6 months ... <unk> drug dealer is arrested the mom loses the kid kid is living with the grand parents 
 the grandparents look at my friend as a big brother and let him take him out on sundays to play with his go kart and has become a very big part of the kids life 
 the mom is not allowed to see the child without supervision 
 the father of the child finds out about this and becomes really good friends with my friend hes an <unk> vet and thanks him for everything he did for the kid 
 short version : friend catches a girl cheating and screwing over her own kid has to steal a gokart from another kid gets mom arrested for drug abuse and child abuse becomes a big brother in the kids life and made a new friend 
 edit : since people missed it up top : all credit goes to <unk> ago i had a nasty breakup with my ex of 8+ years 
 we had a house dog no kids but overall plenty to fight about 
 eventually so tired of it all i told her she could have the house 
 she was in love with the place and wanted to die there 
 i just wanted out 
 the house was <unk> on the mortgage since i had bought it just before the <unk> crash 
 i offered her 10k in order to get out of it 
 with that she could pay down the loan and <unk> it in her name 
 i moved out 
 1.5 years go by and she starts the refinancing process 
 i moved 3 times during this time to my parents and twice for work 
 i’m finally buying a new house 
 although i had all of my small stuff out of her place i still had a pile of tools some appliances and other <unk> 
 things 
 i left it all there because i did n't want to just leave her high and dry for <unk> stuff 
 at this point she had 1.5 years to replace it all 
 the refinancing is finally going through and i gave her <unk> in cash asking her when i could come and pick up my stuff 
 she says i can grab the tools after i give her the rest of the cash but the appliances and some other stuff were hers 
 this was not what i had agreed to 
 i refused to give her another penny 
 she sued me in small claims court 
 the judge went down the list of stuff i was asking for 
 he asked my ex in each instance if she paid for or contributed to paying for any of it 
 to her credit she told the truth that she had not paid a cent 
 in total there was about <unk> worth of appliances and other stuff 
 the tools were n't included because she said i was welcome to pick them up any time 
 the judge said he had to do some math 
 he ordered that i had to pay <unk> in addition to the <unk> i had paid and we were square 
 that i could live with 
 i asked when i could pick up my stuff 
 the judge looked puzzled and said oh well it 's hers now 
 pay up and you are square '' 
 ms. ex loved that and gets this huge smirk as were walking out of the courtroom 
 i ask her when i can meet her to pick up my tools 
 she just looks at me with a shit-eating grin and asks what tools '' 
 at this point i had spent years <unk> to her to keep things civil and now that she did n't need me anymore she was trying to steal everything she could get her hands on and get out of dodge 
 now the revenge : ms. ex worked in the healthcare industry and had access to medical records 
 of course she abused that to screw with me when i started dating again 
 she would pull up stuff and tell me to stay away from so and so for your own good '' 
 she <unk> had this in writing over email so when she decided to outright steal from me all <unk> were off 
 i reported her for a <unk> violation and her ass was fired the next day 
 her entire career was around that industry and she will never get work in it again 
 she took my house dog and a hell of a lot of other stuff but we’re square now 
 : my mother was a horrible person as an example she once told me my father was going to die after he 'd had a heart attack but she 'd already found out from the doctor that he was going to be ok. i was 8 years old at the time and it was simply done to make me cry 
 but in her later years she had <unk> and my sister and i who both hated her and had good reason to had to nurse her for 9 years until she died my father had done the bulk of her caring until he passed away 
 in these years she did her best to cause trouble for as many people as possible but mostly the two of us 
 <unk> for us we had worked out the ways she 'd try and would often be able to head her off at the pass 
 we had a deal between us that if she went too far the offended party could take a break from looking after her and the other would pick up the slack for a few weeks until the air had cleared a bit 
 in 2008 she 'd really offended my sister 's youngest daughter so she took a break 
 my mother then pulled a usual stunt she had when she felt she was n't getting enough attention : she <unk> herself until she was so ill she needed <unk> 
 i got a phone call from my sister one morning telling me our mother had phoned her and was so very <unk> and she wanted my sister to go to her house and wait with her for the doctor to come in other words she wanted attention 
 my sister asked me to do it and i did but i decided to take a book and read it whilst i was there 
 it was a very apt book that i picked simply to get revenge on her as i knew she 'd be too nosy not to ask what it was about 
 it was a <unk> book the title written very <unk> on the cover : when a child kills : abused children who kill their parents 
 i sat and read it for 3 hours beside her <unk> until the doctor arrived 
 after she saw the title she barely said a word the whole time 
 the doctor arrived and told her she was n't ill enough for hospital 
 amazingly within a couple of days she was a lot better and she did n't pull that stunt again for about a year 
 in 2010 i was having a break from her and she did the same thing to try to get my attention 
 this time she went too far ended up with kidney failure and died 
 whilst registering her death the <unk> asked if we needed any extra copies of her death certificate and i said only if you have a framing service '' 
 so one of my brothers is adopted and is amazing 
 he did n't get anything handed to him in life and he 's seriously one of the hardest working people i know 
 just as he was starting his own family he had even more financial burden due to some medical problems 
 still somehow he managed to build half a house on some land my dad sold him 
 he used the <unk> in that to get a second loan and finish it and he had to fight the bank for that even 
 time goes on and he begins to do really well -- so he sells the first house he built at a profit and buys some land 
 like 175 acres in the midwest he lives in a rural area 
 he likes to hunt and does some farming on the land but the house that was there when he bought it is n't ideal despite some major <unk> and renovation 
 so he builds a third house and puts the house up for sale 
 he keeps the land around the house for hunting this is important later 
 this is when one of his <unk> family members asks if he and his wife would consider selling them the house 
 they can only qualify for something like half of what it 's worth but my brother is a fairly generous guy -- he agrees to sell the house to them at a rather hefty discount since they 're family 
 i 'm sure he felt some of their pain as well -- he 'd had his own difficulty back when he was starting out 
 the bank agrees to loan them the money they ca n't go wrong it 's for way less than the property is worth and the deal is done 
 a few short months go by 
 he 's driving by the property and spots a for sale sign 
 he stops in and the husband explains that there were some things about the house they were n't happy with so they were planning on selling it and buying a house more in town or something etc 
 my brother explains that they got a sweet deal only because they were family and that he 'd appreciate them selling the house back to him for what he sold it to them for 
 the husband basically closes the door on that -- and my brother leaves 
 and he thinks about it 
 i 'm 100 % certain that the family members understood that they were getting a good deal because they were family and he was happier selling it to them with the understanding that they were n't to take advantage of his good graces 
 this is a guy by the way that manages big projects 
 he 's a really fair guy 
 the stuff he does in construction probably half of you have driven over -- big bridges that go over <unk> like the mississippi for example 
 he 's used to solving hard problems 
 this one is n't that hard 
 the next day he drives out with some fence in the back of his truck and the family members in the house wake up to some fence posts being driven into the ground 
 the husband comes out 
 what 's going on '' 
 he asks 
 i 'm just putting up some hog fence on my property 
 do n't worry it 's all on my land -- i 'll just go around your house here and put a gate in so you can get in and out '' 
 the husband is a bit <unk> 
 you 're bringing in pigs '' 
 and my brother was seriously set to do it too 
 he had about 100 lined up from a farmer down the road 
 the husband goes back into the house 
 a few minutes of discussion '' occur 
 the next day they all meet at the bank and the deed is transferred back to my brother 
 and he did n't even have to <unk> the hogs ... tl dr family tries to take advantage of my brother on a real estate deal -- he threatens them with living in pig shit.i was originally going to post this as a comment to a story in petty about the inappropriate use of a roommate 's kitchen <unk> but as i wrote it out i realized it bit too severe for pettyrevenge 
 i had a roommate in college who was a nightmare 
 she always tore up my dishes my pots and pans used my shampoo wore my <unk> never asked permission just walked into my room and took whatever she wanted 
 she had nothing of her own i swear 
 my pots were just parts of a cheap set from target but they were all i had 
 the last straw was when she ruined one heating it up with nothing in it why 
 the world may never know 
 i put all the pots and pans in my bedroom and kept my door locked after that 
 i also banned her from touching anything i owned or had purchased 
 i resorted to petty shit like these are my eggs '' and that is my remote '' 
 i was young and entirely too <unk> for my own good i will openly admit 
 she was so upset after a week of being denied part ownership of my things that she ended up <unk> that i move out 
 <unk> move <unk> considering it was my name on the lease not hers and i had been letting her live with me without putting her name on the lease 
 *and* we '' had another two months on our '' lease 
 but ok fine sounds great to me bubbles 
 so i went to the landlord and informed him i wanted out of my lease 
 he was used to students <unk> in and out <unk> <unk> and he said as long as i could find a <unk> and give up my deposit to that person i could leave early 
 naturally he did n't know or probably <unk> they were seedy college apartments that i had an illegitimate roommate who was n't on my lease 
 guess who got a new roommate <unk> of craigslist exactly two days later 
 not me 
 i <unk> with a friend across town until getting a better job and my own apartment 
 this sounds harsh for a burnt pan but earlier in the year my dog bit her 
 he nipped her hand there was no broken skin just one hell of a bruise 
 he nipped her hand because he was in my room and she came in on her own accord when i was not home and reached over him and the <unk> to my door to open my <unk> 
 i had a baby gate blocking him in my room so she had to admit that 's what had happened but said she needed her necklace '' that was mysteriously in my room 
 her parents bullied 20 <unk> into giving him away because i was young and scared of getting in trouble 
 i was paying my own rent and needed her half 
 i ended up <unk> to give the dog away to a friend 
 the whole ordeal was terrible 
 shortly after that she got a cat 
 i think the whole thing was a set-up so she could get a cat without my dog trying to eat it 
 back to the chinese roommate 
 guy found my ad said he and his wife would take it and they were at the door to the leasing office to sign papers that next day 
 she was livid 
 her parents were livid 
 she had told them she was on the lease and they had been paying for half the rent so the sudden realization that she was lying and that she had nowhere to live was a bit <unk> for everyone involved on that end 
 but there was nothing they could <unk> it was my apartment and i had the right to <unk> it as she was not on the lease 
 bitch do n't use my pans 
 i would like to note that i have <unk> quite a bit in the past several years 
 i also lived alone after that until i met my husband five years later so maybe that helped 
 i never apologized for forcing her to live with a random chinese man and his wife though 
 and i have no idea how long she was still there with them until she <unk> he had the right to kick her out 
 i assume he did 
 so <unk> i 'm sorry i possibly forced brief <unk> upon you when we were <unk> in college 
 also fuck your cat 
 tl dr bitch do n't use my pans 
 i worked in an office building for a large well known company when i was younger 
 i was an intern living in the city making almost nothing solely for getting my foot in the door with this job 
 everyone there was nice and i was learning a lot in the field i wanted to enter 
 as far as i could tell things were going well 
 that is until i had to deal with a certain incompetent manager 
 we’ll call him <unk> stain ws 
 i had been working my job for about four months at this point and it was a real bust your ass kind of internship 
 no get coffee and print this 
 it was here are a stack of reports review them learn present to the team and eventually company board members 
 every day i was hitting the work hard meeting difficult deadlines and doing everything i could to get the job done 
 i got there before the sun rose and left well after it had gone down 
 i was dedicated to this job and was determined to get everything i could out of it 
 so being as this was an internship i was required to fill out a weekly timesheet 
 this was signed by a manager in my department to pass onto finance for them to calculate my paycheck off of my hourly rate 
 up to this point i had no issues with anyone signing it or turning it in 
 this particular week most of the <unk> in my department were traveling on business as was common in our industry 
 not just an hour or two away but to the other side of the planet for weeks at a time kind of travel 
 it was a friday and i needed my sheet signed 
 now every manger is familiar with signing sheets and they don’t think twice about it even for people who aren’t members of their particular team 
 my manager and everyone else i would normally go to were away so enter ws 
 now i was pretty familiar with ws but i had never worked one on one with him 
 i had heard several stories around the office during my time there that he was a bit of a prick but had not witnessed anything directly 
 that would soon change 
 me : excuse me ws could you sign my timesheet 
 x x x x and x are away this week on business 
 ws : hmm 
 do you work here 
 it should be noted i’m wearing a company shirt and pants with the <unk> on both my company badge hanging from my belt and i 've been working there for four months about fifty feet away from this man while also attending the same daily meetings 
 me : momentarily taken aback yes i 've been here a few months now 
 would you mind signing this 
 ws : sees it’s a timesheet i won’t sign that 
 me : umm 
 why not sir 
 ws : you don’t work directly under me 
 i don’t know if you have shown up to work all these days 
 me : sir i haven’t missed a day yet and i sit right over there 
 points to desk within shouting distance ws : acts like he’s getting annoyed you need to get x to sign it not me 
 me : sir as i said before x x x x and x are gone this week 
 this has to be turned in today before i can leave 
 if i don’t i will not be paid for my work this week 
 ws : lets out <unk> sigh fine 
 i’ll email x and ask if you have actually been doing your work 
 me : sir x is all the way in china 
 it’s <unk> there now 
 he won’t respond until he wakes up and happens to check his email 
 ws : well that isn’t my problem 
 you mother fucker me : sir this was the last thing i was going to do today before i left 
 i can’t leave until it’s signed and turned in 
 ws : leave it here and hope x replies then 
 i won’t sign until he does 
 me : sigh fine i’ll be waiting at my desk if he does 
 half an hour goes by no signs of progress one hour mark i head to his desk to check on this me : sir has x replied to the em 
 ws : no he hasn’t 
 you’re just gon na have to wait 
 must 
 not 
 <unk> 
 this 
 twat me : i’ll be at my desk then 
 ws : grumbles two hour mark still no signs of progress decide to head to finance to check my options if i can’t get this form turned in on time me : to finance employee i don’t know excuse me miss are x and x around 
 i need to ask them a few questions about my timesheet 
 her : i believe they have already gone home for the day 
 me : hmmm 
 do you happen to know the procedure if an intern like me can’t get my timesheet signed and turned in today 
 her : sure you can turn one in on monday morning at the latest 
 me : that’s the problem though 
 i need the paycheck to go through this weekend so i can pay my bills on time 
 her : i’m sorry 
 that’s all i know about it 
 it’s more x and x’s field 
 me : sigh ok thanks for the help 
 two and a half hour mark go back to my desk walk slowly past ws desk can see still no signature three hour mark still nothing me and ws are now the only people left in the office decide to test the waters again me : walking up to ws desk any <unk> with <unk> 
 ws : no 
 i’m busy 
 if anything changes i’ll give you the damn form 
 eyes go red i grab nearest blunt object <unk> smash smash <unk> his head in ah <unk> hahaha it’s glorious 
 comes back to reality me : ok then 
 i go back to my desk four hour mark building mini houses out of post its <unk> is a thriving <unk> catch glimpse of ws walking toward desk oh glorious everything it’s signed and i’m going home ws : i’m going home me 
 x didn’t send anything so i’m not signing this 
 tosses paper at me turns and leaves expression on my face similar to what i <unk> people living about 20 miles away from <unk> when the bomb went off experienced this bitch is gon na die runs up to ws me : sir i need this signed so i can pay my bills this weekend 
 ws : i’m not signing it 
 ws grabs his stuff and leaves in a huff <unk> teeth walk over and put timesheet on x’s keyboard for monday leave note for him to come talk to me first thing on top of it go home for weekend get some money from parents so i don’t freeze to death in apartment show up to work monday morning tell x and the other managers who gradually gather around what happened can tell by their expression this is going to be sweet x takes ws into meeting room heated words can be heard exchanged even with the door closed hear x say ws needed to apologize to me by the end of the day x comes out first and gives me a nod ws <unk> out and <unk> all eye contact heads back to desk and continues working pretends like nothing happened wait all day no apology and ws heads home fine i’ll get you back one day ws i gather my things and head toward the door <unk> 
 ws has dropped his wallet next to his desk cue evil dave <unk> laugh i’ll sacrifice a goat to you at the next <unk> karma gods i leave quickly with a new addition in my pocket for the next few weeks i don’t say a word ws looks everywhere asks everyone he can’t find it has to cancel credit <unk> loses pictures he can’t replace already pretty bad work performance gets even worse three weeks later finally gets fired after making <unk> to someone higher up the chain who is n't having it ws walks by my desk to say goodbye people were acting all <unk> eyed give me a break ws : me i’m going now 
 sorry about the thing 
 me : looking confused umm 
 do you work here 
 the look on his face delicious to think all you had to do was take three seconds and sign my timesheet ws p.s 
 thanks for buying the homeless guy in front of my apartment a hundred bucks worth of groceries with your cash tl dr president <unk> comes to my high school and gets caught blowing coke off the back of the toilet in the girls restroom by special needs <unk> couple years ago i was renting a duplex 
 it was nice enough in a good area of town 
 not the ideal living situation but the price was right 
 my first set of neighbors were awesome 
 a couple about my age who i shared interests with 
 even though they watched tv or played video games at all hours i very rarely heard them 
 unfortunately they moved out about four months after i moved in 
 a couple with a toddler moved in 
 the <unk> toddler known to <unk> 
 this is relevant because my job did one of those <unk> and <unk> numbers and i was one of the employees who got cut 
 no big deal 
 i had a large emergency fund and could draw unemployment 
 luckily i found a <unk> job shortly after working <unk> 
 the <unk> were even something of an advantage because i could apply for and interview for jobs in my regular field during the day 
 the problem was the hellspawn 
 while i was trying to sleep the child would scream at the top of its lungs run <unk> around their half of the duplex like a herd of <unk> then scream some more 
 when the kid watched tv shows the volume was always jacked to the absolute max 
 it made sleeping difficult even with <unk> <unk> or headphones 
 i tried talking to them 
 hey i work the night shift and so could you please try and keep it down a little '' 
 nothing i tried worked no matter how polite or how firm i was 
 the neighbors responded kids will be kids '' and that 's apartment living you just hear your neighbors '' - even though i mentioned my former neighbors had been <unk> movie <unk> and i rarely heard them 
 fine then 
 i could n't sleep 
 they would n't 
 before i left for my night shift i the volume on my sound system way up and had this song on constant repeat 
 five minutes after i got home the wife of the couple was hammering on my door 
 she started yelling about how all the noise made it so they could n't sleep 
 i responded : sorry i guess i must have set my alarm clock for the wrong time 
 it must be rough when you ca n't sleep right '' 
 simple as that the kid was much quieter 
 i still heard them but only occasionally instead of almost constantly 
 a couple months later i found a day shift job again and all was fine 
 **tl dr** neighbors kid was noisy 
 neighbors would n't listen to polite complaints 
 solved the problem with <unk> 
 posting this to /r/pettyrevenge * edit : since removed * and /r/prorevenge as the revenge was petty but the setup for it took a bit of effort 
 it 's a long <unk> as well 
 working as a bouncer in a quiet gaming room tonight whilst struggling with my fifth day of being off cigarettes so i 'm pretty <unk> 
 a young hipster chick comes up to the bar and asks me <unk> goes with a <unk> <unk> 
 * i 'm a single <unk> scotch man so i 'm not too sure 
 i reply with 'not sure when in doubt try soda water i suppose 
 she then turns around and orders a <unk> of the cheapest beer for her equally cheap looking friend and a <unk> water 
 * at this point i 'm thinking to myself <unk> she ca n't be that stupid 
 * well sure enough her friend with the beer goes to the table whilst soda hipster * man i got ta trade mark that good <unk> band name * goes directly to the toilets returning a minute later with that <unk> blue soda water / black sambuca combo 
 how stupid do you think i am girl really 
 so i <unk> close enough to <unk> <unk> of the conversation they were having plans of where to go from there involving going to get refills at the bottle shop and hitting a club both of which are nearby and happen to be <unk> by good friends of mine in the security industry 
 i duck into the adjacent smoking room and snap a pic of them plan <unk> 
 i then <unk> up around their table when i accidentally air quotes bump her drink sending it flying over her white cloth bag and phone 
 i immediately apologise and offer a replacement 
 part one in action 
 going to the bar i pour another soda water 
 when i put it down in front of her she genuinely looks puzzled telling me she ordered a sambuca and soda 
 to which i reply that she had in fact ordered a soda water self served her own alcohol into said drink illegal here to clarify and that once she finished her soda she could leave the venue as she would n't be served anymore 
 she informed me that she did n't know it was illegal to do that to which i replied if you did n't think it was why do it in the toilets so no one could see you 
 no response so i walk away telling the staff what happened 
 part two involved me sending that pic to the <unk> the two <unk> who had been joined by equally hipster bf 's were going to after here with a request to refuse service / entry to soda hipster^tm 
 around 10 minutes later she goes to the bar and asks for another soda water 
 i calmly <unk> that she ca n't be served anymore to which she says with a smile <unk> you <unk> cunt 
 non aussies : <unk> = <unk> and walks away obviously happy with this insult 
 <unk> i get called that and <unk> daily 
 anyway i send a follow up text to the venue bouncers asking that when they knock her back tell her 'courtesy of the ranga cunt 
 when her friends try to buy more drinks i have informed the staff to refuse them and to say 'courtesy of the ranga cunt as well just for a laugh 
 after a few attempts soda hipster^tm storms out with her obviously embarrassed friends 
 as the bottle shop and club are literally on the same block as i with the bottle shop a few stores from the entrance to my venue i walk outside texting a third time that the group are leaving my place 
 i can see the doorman big dev down the road at the bottle shop check his phone then stick his thumb up in the air without looking at the group 
 the group arrive at the bottle shop and soda hipster^tm is refused service 
 i can tell when dev said the punch line as he <unk> slightly before she spun and stared back in my direction to see me giving a casual wave 
 at least her boyfriend found it funny by the look of him 
 so they disappear around the corner to their second destination only to return around 5 minutes later heading towards me whilst the venue manager and myself are pissing ourselves laughing at soda hipster^tm storming ahead of the pack 
 she pulls up at my door and angrily demands my name 
 i inform her that by law i can only give her my security tag number 
 so she wants to talk to the manager 
 the vm steps in and says that i had done everything in <unk> to the law and that if i said anything to other bouncers to help them in their duties that i was able to do so as its my choice not his 
 frustrated she now wants the manager to get my boss down here 
 i <unk> surprised horror at the suggestion then defeat telling the vm to grab the company business card from the security register 
 as he is doing so soda hipster^tm is standing there with a smug grin and crossed arms saying things like *you 're fucked now there goes your <unk> etc while i try my best to look ashamed 
 the boyfriend is clearly amused by the situation but also torn between being on his gf 's side of the matter as well 
 been there done that buddy 
 the vm returns and gives soda hipster^tm the company business card to which she pulls out her phone and starts dialing the after hours number 
 idly i turn to her boyfriend and ask him if he likes magic <unk> 
 he looks confused 
 the <unk> to <unk> by <unk> <unk> from my pocket 
 i whip out my phone and <unk> ask the bf <unk> <unk> her number sir 
 guess soda hipster^tm did n't realise it was my company but at least he saw the <unk> in it 
 **update : ** so now she is sending abusive texts i 'm replying to each one with this 
 back in highschool i used to sell a bit of weed you know so i could smoke mine for free and have a little extra pocket change for gas and whatnot 
 to give you an idea i 'd dime and 8th out an ounce every week 2 if there was a crazy party that weekend or whatever 
 i never sold more than a quarter and i did n't even like selling that much because it would fuck with my limited profit margin 
 anyways i had met this kid at a party he went to a school in the city i was in the <unk> and ended up becoming a fairly regular <unk> driving up to grab an 8th once in a while as i had a line on some better than most type herb 
 one day i get a call from him asking if he can give this chick he knows my number sure whatever shit was a little slow and i wanted to re up soon 
 so i get a call from this chick and she immediately asks if i can get her a <unk> uhh no '' i hear some <unk> conversation then it 's an ounce still no a half 
 no 
 more whispering and i hear someone getting frustrated in the background she gets back on and asks what i can give her i tell her a quarter at most 
 more whispering and she comes back with a quarter and an 8th whatever i figure theres more than one person wanting weed and like i said i wanted to re up so i agree but i 'm kind of stoned and it 's pouring outside so i tell her she 'll have to come to me 
 fast forward about an hour and she pulls up i run down my driveway and there she is a <unk> trashy looking chick <unk> by one of the <unk> <unk> i 've ever seen 
 now i 'm not trying to sell <unk> to a pregnant chick but i 'm figuring it 's for <unk> <unk> <unk> chilling shotgun 
 i go to her window and she confirms that it 's for him by signaling me to go around the car to deal with him which should have been a redflag but i was n't thinking 
 i go over to <unk> with him the car already <unk> of weed and make the <unk> mistake of handing him the product first he looks at it and starts <unk> up a storm 
 he asks me how much again '' 
 80 dude '' ahhh i ca n't pay 80 for this '' we make eye contact and i realize what 's up 
 i try to grab the weed but he <unk> my hand off it and she peels off almost taking my arm with her 
 now my adrenaline starts going because my arm hit the window frame pretty hard and i 'm just pissed in general so i start frantically looking around for something to throw anything to get them somehow 
 then i see my car in the driveway and then i remember my keys are in my jacket so i hop right the fuck in and start pursuit 
 at this point i 'm starting to think clearly again and i begin to wonder what the fuck can i actually do here 
 i ca n't ram them off the road and i 'm assuming they are heading to bad area where he most certainly would have plenty of back up waiting as it 's clear i 'm following them plus dude was kind of big as it is 
 then it hits me : pregnant chick ghetto <unk> the <unk> bags of weed they just stole i was at the end of my selling supply after the quarter and i had 3 grams <unk> which i just threw in a bag with <unk> so they had <unk> bags of weed 
 i whip out my phone and call the cops tell them i saw some dude with a pregnant girl selling weed to a kid in my neighborhood and i was following them because i was sick of the shit you know bullshitting 
 i stay on the phone and tell them exactly where we are and as soon as we turned onto the main road they get pulled the fuck over 
 i drove on a little ways ahead so i would n't be dragged into it and then busted a <unk> when i passed them like 10 minutes later they had the girl and the dick <unk> girls in the car dicks standing in the rain at the end of the cop car stressing and the one of cops was starting a search of their car ... where he was sure to find a bag filled with weed and 3 other smaller bags of weed possession with intent to motherfucking sell 
 ca n't help that there was a pregnant chick involved either 
 i went home called my buddy over and <unk> in a <unk> of glory

 pro revenge is probably my favorite subreddit so i contribute when i can 
 so a few weeks ago there was a small get together at one of my friends apartments 
 we were drinking <unk> around having a good time 
 well around 2 a.m. we hear a bunch of glass being broken 
 we look out the third story window and see three guys sprinting away from the parking lot 
 i think i recognize one of them but i 've had a few so whatever 
 we look over to my buddy 's truck and his windshield is smashed to hell 
 it 's barely even in the truck anymore 
 we call the police and they say they 'll look into it but probably wo n't be able to do much since there were no cameras and we had been drinking 
 goddamn small town cops 
 my buddy is pissed and i tell him i 'll ask around and see what i can find out 
 people talk at the bar 
 fast forward to a night at work a few days later and i 'm talking to one of my co workers about what happened 
 he said i 'm pretty sure i know who did it '' 
 who '' 
 it was one of my fraternity brothers 
 he 's a complete dickhead and i 'm pretty sure he was bragging about it the other day at meeting '' 
 would you be willing to tell the police '' 
 nah probably not 
 i hate the mother fucker but he 's still in my fraternity 
 he <unk> way too hard though so you can fuck him up if you want to 
 he could use a good ass <unk> '' 
 i 've got a better idea '' 
 he identified the guy as someone we 'll call <unk> for small penis 
 well s is a <unk> at the bar considering it 's the only one in town that all the <unk> go to 
 so i started doing something every time s walked into the bar 
 he 's only 20 so every time he would get someone to get him a drink i would rip it out of his hands and kick him out 
 normally we just take the drinks from guys and give them a warning with three strikes 
 well i would do this every 
 single 
 time he came to the bar 
 it was a $ 10 cover too 
 he would pay come in get a drink and then i would kick him out 
 under 10 minutes every time 
 well after about a dozen times he was really drunk one night and got pissed and got up all in my face 
 i thought to myself he put on his big boy <unk> tonight '' 
 he starts screaming fuck you asshole 
 i do n't have any fun at the bar anymore 
 you never do this to anyone else '' 
 stuff like that 
 sir i do this everyone 
 now leave the bar '' 
 as i start to escort him off the dance floor 
 out of nowhere he turns around and <unk> me as hard as he can 
 standard procedure is that when a fight breaks out we cut the music and turn on the lights so the other bouncers can have better visibility 
 our dj was on point that night 
 as soon as i got hit he cut the music immediately 
 i just stopped and stood there looking at him 
 the lights were on the music was stopped and a circle had begun to form around us 
 i smiled and said you hit like a fucking bitch '' 
 his face went from <unk> to pussy in .5 seconds 
 i told him to hit me again 
 he swung and i put my head down so he nailed me right in the forehead 
 he yelled in pain and grabbed his hand 
 point of information i 'm a really big guy 
 i was an offensive lineman for a division 1 school in college and i was a national champion powerlifter in high school and college 
 i know how to take a hit 
 you punch like a fucking pussy 
 i have n't even hit you and i 'm winning this fight 
 try again you fucking bitch '' 
 at this point he tried to tackle me to the ground 
 i took one step back and just stood there as he put all his weight against me 
 i threw him to the ground after a few seconds 
 this was a lot easier than i thought it would be 
 people were beginning to laugh at him for his bitchy attempts to hit me 
 i could n't resist 
 i turned to the crowd and yelled are you not entertained '' 
 i picked him up off the ground and said you are permanently banned from & lt name of the bar & gt 
 if you ever come back here i 'll hit you harder than you hit my friend 's windshield '' 
 and with that i threw him out for the last time 
 the only other bouncer on the floor was the guy who told me that s needed an ass <unk> 
 he was laughing his titties off the whole time 
 from what my coworker told me s broke his hand on my skull and had to wear a cast for a few months 
 so it cost him over $ 100 to get thrown out of the bar before that night and i imagine several hundred more to get his hand fixed 
 not only that but every single frat guy and <unk> girl knows how big of a bitch he is 
 so that cut his chances of getting laid down to nothing and his ability to shit talk at <unk> games down to nothing as well 
 my friend who got his windshield broken said insurance took care of everything and this was fantastic 
 that 's what you get for being a dickhead 
 i worked for a software company as a qa test lead 
 the company really liked me and i went from a general assistant to a test lead and <unk> my pay in the space of the first 2 and a half years i was there 
 i have a strong work ethic and my opinion held a lot of weight 4 years in when i was leaving to pursue other <unk> 
 my last manager there who we called <unk> day hambly not his real last name but similar because he had a habit of disappearing after lunch on thursdays and fridays 
 none of us minded too much since when he was there he liked to <unk> <unk> and <unk> projects where he knew absolutely nothing and generally made an ass of himself 
 he was known for forcing projects off track and then blaming the platform programmers for the stall he had no problems <unk> people under the bus to give the appearance that he was competent 
 right before i left i had to have minor <unk> surgery and i stopped by his office to let him know that i would need to work from home for a few days afterward which was a routine occurrence in my department and i had done it on a couple of occasions 
 he agreed and i went about my business until he informed me after i put in 30 hours from home while recovering that i would need to use comp time to cover my missed hours 
 i went to him and reminded him of the fact that he ok 'd it and he gave me a <unk> you smile and said <unk> i guess you should have put it in an email 
 so the following week when i did my exit interview with hr on my last day i unloaded on them and told them all about <unk> hambly 's adventures in <unk> and how he regularly skipped out after lunch to go play golf on thursdays and fridays 
 the hr manager i spoke with tried calling his office to bring him down right then but got no answer 
 he asked me if i 'd go by his office and bring him down but when i went up i found his office locked and no one answered the door 
 the look on the hr managers face was priceless when i told him this as it was <unk> on friday when this happened 
 the hr manager had my check adjusted for me wished me luck and i left with a smile on my face knowing i had <unk> this asshole 
 2 weeks later my good friend and coworker called me up to say <unk> who they just fired 
 hr started watching old <unk> after i left and determined his <unk> of excellence would serve him best somewhere <unk> had posted the story of my divorce here a little while back here is the story 
 well ... onto the fun part 
 & amp nbsp just 2 days ago i was at my local wal-mart picking up dog food for my dogs and <unk> <unk> for my bearded dragon 
 i had been having a strange feeling the entire time like an <unk> in the middle of my back that i could n't quite reach to scratch 
 it had started about 3 minutes after i had gotten into the store and had been persistent the entire time only ever going away one time when i had stepped into the bathroom 
 & amp nbsp i came back out of the bathroom grabbed my cart and out of habit and <unk> did a quick <unk> scan of the area by the bathrooms 
 unfortunately i saw something i had no desire to see 
 4 registers down trying to hide behind a rack of <unk> and failing miserably due to the fully exposed *very* <unk> <unk> child in the cart ... .was <unk> 
 & amp nbsp from what i could see she was on the phone and not happy with the conversation she was having 
 she would keep looking at me i had my phone out and was pretending to text while looking at her out of the corner of my eye and would get even more agitated 
 & amp nbsp so since i was pretty much done with shopping i <unk> my cart into the nearest cash register laid my items on the belt not the dog food i was gon na let them come with a hand <unk> to scan that 50 pound bastard of a bag and smoothly deliberately scanned over and <unk> directly at her* 
 & amp nbsp well this apparently set her off because as soon as she saw me doing so she blew up on the phone seemed to be practically yelling into it 
 i calmly finished paying for my items put the bags into my cart and headed for the entrance 
 thundercunt however had other plans ... & amp nbsp she promptly pushed her cart out of her <unk> hiding spot took a second to see which way i had gone and took off after me 
 she almost threw her cart in front of me trying to get me to stop and proceeded to give me the dirtiest look i had ever seen from her and that 's saying something and then said something i still have yet to wrap my mind around 
 & amp nbsp ** '' i want my divorce 
 ** & amp nbsp now i had to stop and take a second to try to process that particular statement as to my knowledge we had gone through our divorce hearing several months prior 
 so after thinking it over and <unk> the statement as being the raving of a person who already lost the argument but refuses to let it go i maneuvered my cart around hers took a second to smile at her child hell i had nothing against the baby and all jokes aside she was adorable and began walking out the door 
 thundercunt responded with oh you 're just going to ignore me 
 i want my divorce you bitch '' 
 & amp nbsp well i just kept walking 
 on my way out a rather <unk> guy of the t-shirt with the <unk> cut off '' variety rushed past me right up to tc 
 they exchanged a brief flurry of conversation littered with her pointing at me and then at him ending with her throwing her hands up and walking away with her cart 
 he looked at me i smiled a bit and gave them both the <unk> salute and loaded my stuff in my truck and left 
 & amp nbsp honestly the only thing i can assume from the situation is that he was either a : a new boyfriend or b : a family member that i was n't familiar with hell might have been both who knows that she had enlisted the help of to either intimidate me into giving her more or to rough me up 
 it would make sense with her <unk> off a statement that had been <unk> months beforehand 
 either way whatever she was attempting failed miserably when i applied the tried and true method of ignore the idiots and move on '' 
 **tl dr : ** thundercunt comes back for round 2 gets shut down just as hard as before 
 i used to work at a busy local pizza restaurant '' as a pizza cutter for $ 10 <unk> cash in hand 
 so my job involved cutting pizzas and sorting out the orders not very hard unless there is twenty coming out of the oven in a minute ... anyhow i wo n't lie i would make a couple of mistakes here and then with orders 
 as you would expect you would a stern talking to by the boss after each one 
 however after a while the mistakes started becoming more and more frequent to the stage where i was getting screamed at i was now triple checking orders because i was sure i had them right 
 one night i '' was up to eight mistaken orders then i turn around and catch the mother fucker mixing up my orders that i had organised and then walking off 
 i was fucking furious 
 i was copping all this shit because this cunt bag was making mistakes ... so after that night i fucking handed it to him 
 i told him what i thought about him and his shitty restaurant 
 there were no safety or health standards enforced with the meals or anywhere in the kitchen tbh 
 so here is what i do ... turns out a lot of my friends ordered from the store so of course i tell them how there food is prepared and how there is no respect for the employees 
 by word of mouth one of the people still working there tells me their nights gradually began getting quieter 
 then i thought to myself how else can i <unk> this cunt bag '' 
 then i remembered that he used to make around $ 3500 - $ <unk> after wages '' every night 
 so i did some math and established if he had been cutting corners by keeping people off the books then he owed a shit load of tax and super to everyone that worked there 
 so i made a phone call to the tax office and it turns out he owed them <unk> of $ <unk> au provided he had been paying cash in hand for the past eight years the business had been running 
 i 'll just say ... there is no more local pizza shop 
 i believe the tax evasion also landed him some jail time so serves the cunt right 
 tldr boss was an asshole i made him lose his business and had him sent to <unk> my mom was 19 yrs old she was raped in her small town in germany she got pregnant as a result and <unk> the baby 
 she never reported the crime cause she was ashamed and felt like it was her fault 
 many years later i 'm in her home town when a man approaches the table we are at with myself my mom and my dad he asks how my mom is doing 
 my dad got really pissed off that he would come near us and i later found out that man was the person who raped my mom 
 life goes on a year passes i 'm visiting my grandma in the home town at the bar having a beer 
 the man who raped my mother walks in i know what he did and he knows who i am 
 i ignore him the conversation in the bar turns to a sexual one 
 the man points at me and says your mom had the best pussy '' without thinking i grabbed the bottle of vodka the bar tender kept his bottles near the edge of the bar and <unk> him across the head with the bottle as hard as i could the bar tender grabbed me and said what are you doing '' 
 i yelled back he is the guy who raped my mother '' bar tender was familiar with the story did n't know who did it but knew the person still lived in the same town bar tender let me go i jump on top of him and start punching him 
 he was dazed by being smacked in the head with a hard vodka bottle and did n't really have it in him to resist 
 finally a customer come over to me and pulled me off 
 i was able to get a few kicks into his <unk> and i was pulled away and put in the corner 
 man came back up ran towards me to avenge his injustice when the same customer who break us up stopped his advance the man yelled at the bar tender to call the cops 
 the bar tender said get out of my bar and never come back '' the man <unk> away no cops where ever called tl : dr beat up the man who raped my mother for making a comment about her vagina 
 * later my mom found out about it she told my dad he needs to tell me not to do that 
 my dad smiled and said like father like son 
 apparently he took once beat the shit out of this man for raping my mom 
 i posted this to /r/pettyrevenge but have received encouragement to post it here as well 
 this is going to be long but i 've been dying to tell this story 
 it 's about how i put a narcissistic woman in her place after being accused of stealing on facebook 
 a few years ago i was involved in one of those swap and sell '' groups on facebook 
 it was specifically for stay-at-home moms and mostly centered around trading and selling clothing toys etc 
 it was an awesome resource because you could get things for your children at a very low price and often make new friends in the process 
 there was one woman however that made the swap and sell group an unpleasant place 
 we 'll call her kathy 
 in person all she ever talked about was herself specifically about how great she was 
 she did the same for her kids 
 she would also slip little hints in about how you or your children were <unk> in some way 
 for example she would say things like oh your child 's soccer team came in third place last season 
 my son 's team came first but that 's not very surprising considering how good he is 
 i must have done a great job raising him and it 's a shame that others ca n't do the same with their children '' 
 she really would say things like that 
 in hindsight she was a narcissist 
 i 'm not just saying that i 'm pretty sure she could be diagnosed 
 i just did the best i could to avoid her if i saw her in the next aisle of a store 
 one day she saw me with my infant son 
 he was crying so she came over and said oh let me hold him 
 i can get him to calm down '' 
 it was infuriating 
 almost everyone hated her 
 but kathy really took it to the next level when it came to the swap and sell 
 she would be the first in line to buy something only to demand a lower price upon inspection 
 these clothes look dirtier than what i saw in the picture i will only pay half '' 
 she did this crap all the time and if the seller did n't oblige she posted a rant about how they screwed her over never do business with them yada yada 
 this sort of talk was technically against the rules of the swap and sell but kathy was friends with the administrator so nothing was ever done 
 the administrator was lazy anyway and rarely interacted with the group 
 furthermore kathy had a few cronies that would send pms to everyone in the group bad-mouthing sellers who did n't <unk> kathy 's half price crap 
 it was borderline blackmail 
 i always felt some anxiety when i posted something for sale because i was afraid kathy would claim it first and then pull her scam 
 which she did several times 
 she had facebook hooked up to her phone and since she sat at home and did nothing all day she was fast to jump on items for sale 
 <unk> she would buy something and then it would appear for sale months later at a jacked up price 
 what made this all the more frustrating was the fact that she was a pastor 's wife and had good standing in the community 
 nobody knew what a bitch she was even though she was a toxic and selfish person who cared only about herself 
 i put up with this woman for three years 
 then one day i had had enough ... i listed a toy for sale 
 it needed 2 aa batteries to work 
 knowing this i purchased a new pack of batteries and put them in the toy 
 i tested it 
 it worked 
 i said that batteries were included in my listing 
 everything seemed to be in order 
 within two minutes kathy jumped in and said she wanted it 
 she obviously saw it pop up on her phone while she was <unk> around at home 
 the rules said i had to offer it because it was first come first serve '' and i could not skip over buyers 
 so with a heavy heart i set up a time to bring it to kathy 's house she refused to meet me halfway or come to my home as was her custom 
 i dropped off the toy when i was in town running errands the next day 
 kathy did n't try to pull the usual it looks dirtier than the pic '' scam so that was nice 
 she asked if the batteries were included and i said yes 
 i received payment and went about my day 
 kathy was playing fair 
 <unk> damn time ... but when i got home i had 20+ notifications on facebook 
 kathy had tagged me in a post 
 uh oh this could n't be good ... in her post she claimed that there were no batteries 
 she posted a pic of the empty battery <unk> shamed me for my shady sales tactics gave a little sob story about how her chubby <unk> old soccer star was upset that he could n't play with it and demanded her money back 
 on top of this shitstorm one of my friends <unk> me saying that people were receiving messages from kathy 's cronies about how selfish and shady i was 
 that bitch 
 i had never been more pissed and hurt in my life 
 i was done putting up with this chick 's shit 
 i responded with a rather lengthy message calling her out on her scams in the past 
 i said she was a liar for removing the batteries and that she should be ashamed of herself for behaving in such a manner when she was a pastor 's wife 
 many people liked my comment and i knew that the shit was about to hit the fan but i did n't care anymore 
 when i logged in to facebook the next day i had a ton of notifications and messages 
 my stomach dropped 
 i <unk> through the messages first 
 some were positive thanking me for calling kathy out 
 some were negative from kathy 's cronies about what a rude person i was to say those things about her 
 as for the notifications most of them <unk> from a single post that had been <unk> by the <unk> in the swap and sell group 
 apparently she <unk> her laziness just long enough to publicly humiliate me 
 the post said that thieves -- yes thieves -- were not tolerated in the group and then went on to <unk> me by name 
 ** this was no small thing as there were many women involved in this group and we were in a small midwestern town where word traveled fast 
 my reputation as a mother was being attacked 
 the post went on to say that rather than <unk> me i had the opportunity to apologize and refund the money i owed 
 the first comment to the post was from kathy 
 she said something that no doubt she had been dying to say for a long time 
 it went something like this : <unk> you 've stolen money from me and tried to blame your past actions on me as well 
 and yet in the face of your accusations i have been patient and kind 
 this peace comes from the lord 
 if you would only accept him as your savior you would feel the same peace 
 if nothing else this whole situation just <unk> that i am better than you '' 
 over twenty people liked the comment 
 holy fuck 
 this shit had to stop 
 kathy the narcissist was turning the tables and accusing me of actions which were actually hers an actual case of <unk> 
 the time for vengeance had come 
 **the revenge** this requires a bit of explaining 
 you see kathy had a secret one that i stumbled on by accident several years prior while reading the local newspaper while doing errands in the next town over 
 in one small corner regarding court <unk> there was a column about a man who had killed his friend while high on bath <unk> 
 i do n't remember the exact details of the crime nor did i know what the nature of the court proceedings were 
 but thanks to the column i did know that this man had been found mentally unfit to stand trial and sent to the state mental hospital and i did know the names of his parents who were present at the hearing 
 the parents strangely enough had the exact same names as kathy and her husband 
 i did some googling and discovered that this man was kathy 's oldest son 
 kathy never mentioned having another son for obvious reasons 
 this crime happened when kathy and her family were living in this other town 
 soon after her son was sent to the mental ward kathy and her husband moved away to my town 
 i knew that she had lived elsewhere before joining the swap and sell but i did n't know that she had moved to distance herself and her husband from their dark secret 
 this was my short and sweet response to kathy 's comment i still remember it word for word : kathy you 've asked me to apologize for actions that were yours and then have the audacity to say that you 're better than me 
 but what 's funny kathy is that the son you raised turned out to be a lunatic murderer 
 i will always be better than you '' 
 and i posted a link to the old news article 
 i did not stick around to watch everything go down as i was sick of the drama 
 i removed myself from the group and went about my day 
 **the aftermath** i received a phone call from a close friend in the evening and i learned what had happened 
 after i posted the link to the article about kathy 's son the comments section absolutely blew up 
 kathy and her cronies posted several comments where the group administrator was tagged demanding that my comment be deleted 
 my friend said that there were several posts like this and they started to sound pretty desperate near the end 
 the lazy administrator of course was slow to respond 
 kathy even said something about driving to the administrator 's house since she was not returning her phone calls 
 after a couple of hours the whole swap and sell group was deleted 
 but the damage was done 
 as for what happened to kathy i never had the chance to find out as she deleted her facebook 
 i saw her in the grocery store a few weeks later but she just flipped me off and walked the other way 
 my friends and i founded a new swap and sell group 
 it gets bigger every day but kathy is not a part of <unk> post long time lurker here but i believe you guys would like this story 
 this is not my story but of a good friend of mine let 's call him mitch whom i 've known for many many years now 
 this happened 15 years ago when mitch and i were both 16 yo 
 mitch has two younger brothers at the time 14 and 15 yo 
 mitch and his brothers had the most beautiful golden lab always friendly a bit lazy as labs can be loved everybody truly a great dog 
 the neighbor though hated the dog something about its fur getting in his lawn when it shed i live in a warm <unk> country so dogs tend to shed a lot here something about it barking during <unk> in any case the neighbor was being a bitch about it 
 now mitch 's parents are of the quiet type trying to accommodate they even put a fence inside their own yard to keep the dog in the other side of the yard facing the property of the other neighbor that had no issues with their dog kept the dog inside during <unk> and mitch and his brothers would brush the <unk> regularly during the summer months to limit any <unk> 
 to make a long story short one day they come back home after a day trip and they find the dog <unk> and <unk> in their yard dying soon after 
 they immediately knew what happened as the telltale signs of a poisoned dog were all too familiar to the father as he had witnessed it time and time again in his youth when the local police would poison stray dogs during the 50s and <unk> to contain an outbreak of <unk> 
 mitch and his brothers were <unk> 
 their parents confronted the neighbor who without admitting guilt said something along the lines 'the dog had it coming 
 the parents for reasons unknown probably to avoid any prolonged legal battle or to just put an end to the story decided not to press charges which <unk> mitch and his brothers to take the <unk> action they believed the neighbor deserved 
 i am not saying that i <unk> what they did but let 's say that as a dog lover it still brings a smile to my face 15 years later 
 they waited patiently for 3 days after the event when the neighbor and his wife their children had moved out a few years prior went out for the night 
 small <unk> all 3 were and still are some of the kindest and most thoughtful <unk> that i know 
 but i <unk> they waited for the neighbors to go out for the night and that 's when they broke into the house and started to <unk> destroy everything the neighbors owned 
 electronics furniture <unk> carpets <unk> everything 
 they spent a good one hour in the neighbors house <unk> <unk> 
 he later told me that it was very meticulous and <unk> 
 they all 3 were crying and just moving on to the next object to break or <unk> or tear 
 they then sat outside the porch and waited 
 sometime later the neighbor comes back home and they just stare at him and smile <unk> to him as he enters his house with his wife 
 he never pressed charges either 
 mitch 's parents now have 3 golden labs in the yard and have always had dogs since then 
 as far as i know they never really had issues with the neighbor <unk> i was younger my favorite fruit was strawberries 
 i could eat pounds and pounds of it and not get sick 
 unfortunately it is also my mother 's favorite fruit 
 every time we would buy some she would tell me to only eat half since the other half was hers 
 of course being six years old and home alone does not give me good impulse control 
 so i ate all of the box 
 my mother whooped my butt and sent me to bed without dinner 
 i thought that was the end of it 
 my mother on the other hand decided that she was sick of me eating all the strawberries in the house 
 she decided that she was going to stop me from eating them once and for all 
 so she decided to change the detergent and do all of my laundry 
 now i have very sensitive skin and i am allergic to a lot of things including <unk> 
 i break out into hives when i deal with an <unk> 
 so she changed the detergent to a very <unk> one to get back at me 
 the next day i broke out in hives at school and fainted 
 mom was n't done then 
 she took me to the doctor for a blood test since we were still trying to figure out if i was <unk> and told me that the doctors think i am allergic to strawberries 
 this was devastating 
 i was told that it could have been worse that i could have died from eating even a little bit 
 it has been 14 years since i have had a single bite of a <unk> 
 i barely remember what they taste like 
 however i found out all about this at a family party when introducing my boyfriend 
 i told him about how i ca n't have strawberries for <unk> 
 my mom walks up looks at me funny of course you can 
 you 're not allergic '' 
 the second i reminded her she began to laugh 
 oh you were never allergic '' 
 i found out the rest from my dad 
 thanks mom 
 i hate you too 
 tl dr : do n't fuck with my mom 
 edit : i did not expect this to blow up as bad as it did 
 glad you guys thought it was an entertaining story 
 for those who were wanting it to be about me getting revenge see rule 2. now to answer the most frequent issues since you guys are starting to scare me 
 my mom is not an abuser 
 she is a little mentally <unk> but she does her best with what she has 
 she thought this was the best way to teach me a lesson and it did 
 it was not the best way to go about it however 
 i fainted not because of the hives but because i had forgotten to eat my snack according to my dad 
 i was diagnosed with type two <unk> when i hit that age 
 second we were a poor family who could n't afford child care 
 my cousins lived the apartments above us and my mother worked at the grocery store that was a five minute walk even when i was six 
 she was our only provider due to my dad 's <unk> 
 when we finally moved for her new job we got child care but i was too old for that by then 
 the big deal was that i was taking away all the treats in our house for myself 
 that 's why my mother was upset 
 we rarely got anything sweet let alone fresh fruit 
 hence why i went crazy 
 yes my dad knew 
 i have no idea why he did n't tell me 
 it 's over and done now for me 
 i thought it was a little funny but it confirmed my ideas about putting them both in a nursing <unk> needed a place to stay and did not have much of a choice in the matter 
 the price and location were right so i had to rent from this slumlord 
 **the <unk> he is a self proclaimed handy man '' 
 he drove a gutted out <unk> of a van filled with cheeseburger wrappers and junk 
 acted less than interested in any of my problems as a tenant i went through 3 fridges used ones not new of course hundreds in groceries lost a bunch of clothing and furniture when the house flooded twice in one week there was a faint but constant smell of natural gas the <unk> only worked when you lit the pilot light which you had to do every time you wanted heat in the winter and half a fucking tree that landed on the roof during a storm but was never removed 
 **me** <unk> tend to be too god damn nice at times always always always pay my rent on time took care of all of the utilities and general <unk> mowed <unk> snow cleaned the lawn etc etc of the property during my tenancy 
 <unk> <unk> i have too many stories about this cat but i 'll get to the revenge part of this 
 i had finally had enough and i had decided to move out of this <unk> 
 i had lost thousands in my own money to use on the <unk> of the property since the landlord had no intention on helping me ever 
 i had found a new place and had told my landlord the news when i handed him a check for a month and a half and told him that i would be moving out in a set number of days 
 we agreed and it seemed to go quite well 
 this is when all of the shit really started running downhill 
 he showed up in my apartment one day unannounced and was looking for something 
 to this day i do n't know what but i confronted him and he ran out of my apartment like he had been just caught snooping in a woman 's <unk> drawer 
 then when i am at work he starts leaving me this really creepy messages saying i did n't pay him rent and that i have been destroying the property 
 i brush it off take a few days off of work and move out of my place after i call my new landlord explaining my <unk> 
 my new landlord agrees to let me move in early free of charge awesome 
 i move out and get a couple of friends to help me deep clean the place its amazing what you can buy with a case of beer and some pizza 
 we clean the place and its spotless 
 after we finish i get this weird feeling and i take pictures 
 tons and tons of pictures of every room 
 feeling content we pack up the rest lock the doors and leave 
 we had a good night and i bought pizza and beer for my friends that came out to help 
 a couple days go by and slumlord larry calls and asks where i went 
 i explained that i really wanted to move and i worked out a situation with my new landlord that would allow me to move in early 
 he started shouting at me on the phone going off about how i still owe him money and i could n't terminate my lease which there was no such thing by the way just a verbal agreement and the exchange of money 
 i had enough of his business and i hung up 
 a month goes by i hear nothing from the slumlord 
 then all of a sudden i get a certified letter from him in the mail along with some pictures how in the fuck did he get my new address i think to myself 
 i open the letter and dude is going to try and fucking sue me 
 stating that i damaged his property with supposed <unk> evidence and for the neat sum of $ 5,000 dollars it would all go away and we would not need to take it to court 
 i say fuck this and i call up my parents to get the number for their lawyer 
 i explain everything to him and tell him about the pictures i saved 
 i ask my lawyer if there is anything that i could do about this 
 i 'm steaming and i want blood 
 my lawyer laughed it off and told me to go check and see if the property was listed under a rental property in the city that i lived in 
 the next day i go down to the government center and i find out that the slumlord does not have it listed as anything other than residential 
 i turn him in and i also find out that the property can not be rented and a permit for someone to even come look at the property to make sure it was up to code in the county i lived in was $ 5,000 
 jubilant would not even begin to describe my mood at this time 
 i was white guy '' celebrating the bitch out of the lobby 
 i call my lawyer as i am leaving the government center and tell him the good news 
 as i am leaving town i decide to drive past my place and see if anyone is living there 
 as i pass i ca n't believe my fucking <unk> 
 i see the slumlord and a buddy of his <unk> dave '' outside the house destroying the <unk> 
 i also see that they had fucked up every exterior part of the house to try and pin their misdeeds on me 
 months go by i hear nothing my lawyer hears nothing despite multiple tries to contact slumlord 
 at this point i am filled with an overwhelming sense of joy as i stuck it to that loser 
 <unk> wait there 's more 
 ** i was telling this story to a buddy of mine at work one day and he knew exactly what house i was talking about 
 his dad is the county building inspector and he was telling me about how is dad had stated that the property was so damaged that the house was to be condemned 
 all i 'm left thinking about is what did he do to that fucking place to <unk> it after i moved out 
 **tl dr** slumlord did n't do shit for me and i lost out on a ton of money 
 got him back by finding out the property was not listed as a rental property 
 house ended up getting <unk> never believed in karma 
 until this story 
 a couple of years back i was in a relationship with a wonderful girl 
 we had been together for 5 years at that point living together for 2 of them 
 about a year and a half after we moved in together i lost my job 
 it hit me hard to say the least and i became kinda depressed 
 i guess my girlfriend though <unk> me and helping me out was too much because she began sleeping with her co-worker 
 i saw their e-mail exchange and i lost it 
 i wanted to confront her so bad but i knew that would do nothing 
 so i decided to get some revenge 
 because i was n't on the lease when we got the apartment i had shitty credit i could move out no problem 
 one morning i arranged some <unk> to come by our apartment and moved out 
 but before i did that i logged into her e-mail and forwarded the exchange between her and the co-worker to the head of hr 
 later that day i got a text saying that her company let her go that they were cutting back on staff 
 i simply texted her i know you 've been cheating on me with <unk> not his real name 
 i moved out this morning 
 never talk to me again '' 
 2 days later she shows up at my mom 's house asking where i am 
 my mom plays dumb and says she has no clue 
 she relentlessly texted me after i moved out 
 and continued to do so for a while 
 last i heard she moved in with her sister <unk> from depression and is an alcoholic 
 i guess i 'm a bad person because that brought a smile on my face 
 edit : forgot to add that the guy she was cheating on me with got fired as <unk> : i 'm a real estate developer and <unk> and i <unk> several mid-size multi-family rental properties 
 i 'm aggressive with rents but i love the construction side of the business and take great pride in keeping my properties in excellent condition 
 i also ensure my staff provides top notch customer service - i never understood why property managers do n't have the same attitude towards customer service as <unk> 
 anyways ... one of my friends lives in a building owned by a very traditional '' landlord 
 a grumpy old lady bangs on the door to collect rent every month things do n't get fixed unless you threaten to file a dispute and in general everything is fixed as cheaply as possible 
 my friend called me last week and said her fire alarm has been going off since 3am 
 not the fire alarm actually but the warning tone on the annunciator panel - this is the device that receives <unk> from heat <unk> smoke <unk> etc all around the building and <unk> and provides power and battery backup 
 this panel was apparently <unk> a fault and sounding the warning tone 
 this is n't the fire alarm but it sounds like a loud smoke <unk> going off 
 it can not be silenced until it is serviced 
 in my buildings they occasionally do go off every few years and as with everything else my staff must attend within 1/2 hour and in this case appropriate action would be to call the fire safety contractor for an emergency service call 
 my friend 's landlord informed her that the contractor had been called but it was not an emergency so they would be there in 4 days 
 <unk> days of this alarm going off 24/7 <unk> no sleep for anyone 
 this was likely to avoid the overtime <unk> for an emergency service 
 or about $ 150 
 but the manager was kind enough to wrap the panel in several towels with packing tape to slightly <unk> the alarm 
 he made a <unk> attempt to silence it by pulling the leads off the backup battery 
 since the device is <unk> this just <unk> the frequency of the alarm to include a backup battery warning '' 
 i grabbed by panel keys and went over to see if i could help my friend out 
 i was able to open the panel since i have keys for my own and they are the same 
 the battery leads had been pulled off but the main was still connected so the <unk> was going off like crazy 
 the manager did n't know enough to turn off the breaker in the electrical room and i could n't access it 
 the manager did n't answer the phone 
 upon opening the panel i saw immediately why it had been failing on and off for years according to my friend - the batteries were 10 years out of date and the leads on the <unk> were <unk> 
 it looked like the landlord had been <unk> out the old batteries with new ones for the yearly inspection then putting the old ones back in and maybe returning the new batteries for a refund 
 now i realized why the service call was scheduled so late - so the ll could get some temporary new '' batteries put in time 
 now i 'm a licensed property manager but not an electrician so it would be unethical for me to remove the hot lead from the bus bar and silence the alarm but low voltage wiring is a different story 
 unfortunately my insulated screwdriver slipped as i was <unk> the battery lead back on and i accidentally <unk> the hot side of the bus bar with the low voltage side of the circuit board 
 luckily my eyes were <unk> to avoid <unk> injury 
 <unk> right to the control board 
 ouch 
 a big flash breaker tripped somewhere and silence 
 the circuit board was <unk> - the service tech would have to install a new panel with new batteries 
 my friend contacted the landlord and reported that something had happened and the panel was silenced 
 also did he intend to provide a 24 hour <unk> until such time as the fire alarm system is fully functional as required by section 6 of the fire code 
 he <unk> that he did not and that she could fuck off 
 her next call was to the assistant chief fire inspector since she happened to have his business card handy 
 his response was much more <unk> - he was happy to provide the necessary <unk> and contacted the landlord to inform him of the fact 
 the <unk> 's union is a strong one and their hourly rate for emergency services like this are comparable to a <unk> <unk> law firm 
 i 'm told the bill reached $ 3000 before the landlord called the service tech to replace the annunciator panel 
 i 'd like to say he also paid the $ 5,000 fine but i understand he is fighting that in court 
 in the meantime the building <unk> peacefully with a fully functional and up to date fire alarm 
 just thought i would share a story related to me by my grandfather 
 back in 'the war my grandpa was in the navy 
 he was a fairly skinny guy but obscenely tough 
 being of italian <unk> he received <unk> than his fair share of shit from his <unk> 
 being as <unk> was not exactly on the best of terms with the us back in <unk> i can only imagine the <unk> <unk> on his ship were pretty much dick to him 
 he could have easily <unk> and come out on top but that was n't his style 
 he was a gentleman and apparently always gave people the benefit of the doubt and allowed opportunities to change their own minds 
 one job of his on ship was packing and <unk> i assume <unk> 
 quick sidebar here : when you were going to be jumping out of a plane be it for a combat mission or training you used the chute you are issued 
 no exceptions 
 none 
 you are given a parachute and that 's what you used 
 anywho ... my grandpa would occasionally play with the chutes of people who made his life hell 
 not that they were in any way unsafe just playing with people 's heads 
 what he would do is leave a few scraps of <unk> parachute cloth or suspension <unk> hanging out of the packed chute 
 when he was issuing the chutes to the <unk> and someone noticed stuff sticking out he would just go <unk> no problem and cut off the offending material and hand it back to the guy he cut off the junk he had added the chutes were still perfectly packed 
 these assholes would have to spend the next few hours <unk> that <unk> chutes had been tampered with and that they were jumping to their <unk> obviously they <unk> but the did n't know it until they pulled the <unk> and their chute worked perfectly 
 people stopped being dicks to him and just left him alone after he taught a few people their lesson 
 my grandpa is a smart old <unk> enjoying this subreddit and thought i 'd post my own story here 
 while not as epic as some of these or as clever as nobody ended up in jail or out thousands of dollars for me it was a pretty important victory 
 regarding the survival mode thing - years ago i was living with a couple of friends and lost both my job and my place to live within the same 24 hours when the economy shit itself and the bank foreclosed on the owner where we were staying 
 had about two weeks to get out and i ended up homeless and living in my car for two years 
 that 's another story entirely 
 the point however is when living in a large city in a vehicle your survival mode kicks in constantly 
 you 're always worried you 're always cautious and in the event something happens that 's a threat you usually think of the most effective brutal and <unk> way to remove it as a threat 
 as a result even years later now that i 'm stable i do n't really have the ability to <unk> an appropriate response to a threat 
 maybe that 's why i went overboard here but i 'll share the story and let others be amused or pass judgement as the case may be 
 when i was living in my car i developed a relationship with someone who was a bit more stable than i was 
 she did n't really care that i lived in a car as i was always <unk> and was able to hold down temp work - nobody really knew i lived in a car unless i shared that info with them 
 she was big on helping people and was genuinely a good person as i thought at the time 
 we had a falling out and just gradually lost contact 
 our relationship was more of a passion thing 
 we remained friends on facebook and she was fairly popular on there with about five hundred friends 
 this is important later 
 about a year after the two of us broke up and about six months after i had last spoken to her outside of a few casual comments and likes '' i was doing much better 
 i had just started a new job that i was about to go through training for and afterwards would be out of the car and into a more permanent residence 
 i had done a lot to work towards that point and things were great 
 i was at a <unk> using their internet on my laptop and my phone rang 
 it was her 
 after a very brief exchange of pleasantries she gets to the point - her current boyfriend got her pregnant and left her 
 she needed someone to take her to the abortion clinic and since she was <unk> perfect girl to her circle of friends and family she could n't ask any of them to do it 
 so she was asking me 
 on one hand i was perturbed that this was the first time we had spoken in a long time and this was the only subject she felt was important enough to call me on 
 on the other i try to be a good guy and even though it <unk> i was raised that way 
 but in this situation i really could n't help her because i was supposed to drop my car off at a friends house the next day then hop a bus to another state for my orientation and new job 
 even if i wanted to which i really did n't i could n't 
 i told her as much and then shit hit the fan 
 she started screaming at me on the phone acting hysterical crying telling me that i was a horrible person i had to help her i did n't care about her etc 
 by this point the other people in the computer area are hearing her scream at me over my phone and i 'm getting quite a few stares 
 i tell her in a tense voice that i had to get off the phone and for her to send me a message 
 some of you may be getting ahead of me here and see where this is going and think in advance i 'm an asshole but please reserve judgement 
 i promise it 's worth it 
 my facebook chat window starts lighting up with more insults 
 i realize that this may bite me in the ass remember about how i do n't respond well to things i see threatening and start to steer the conversation asking her details - and she gets dragged along 
 i confirm in the chat that she was pregnant 
 i confirm in the chat he ran out on her 
 i asked why he ran out on her as i thought the two of them were close and she tells me that there was a chance it was n't his 
 i tell her that once again i ca n't help her as i need to catch a bus tomorrow morning 
 up to this point i 'm willing to wish her luck and let it go i start a new life tomorrow 
 she then drops a <unk> on me 
 if you do n't help me with this i 'm going to tell everyone that it 's yours and that you raped me '' 
 oh hell no 
 she did not just say that 
 and then i realize - she said it over facebook chat 
 instead of warning her instead of telling her to fuck off i instead start thinking about what a false rape accusation would do to me on the eve of everything that 's about to change for my life 
 i have one thought <unk> out of the survival mode that got kicked into high gear - destroy this bitch 
 and i know how to do it 
 i ask her if she 's serious when she knows there 's no way the kid is mine 
 she says she does n't care 
 i ask her who she thinks is going to believe her 
 she says it 's my word against hers and who are people going to believe 
 her or some homeless <unk> who lives in his car 
 knowing i know have enough <unk> i pretend to reluctantly relent 
 i tell her <unk> fine i 'll help you but i ca n't take you to the clinic tomorrow 
 it will have to be later this week 
 i have to change my plans let me call you tomorrow '' 
 she agrees 
 i then get to work 
 within a few minutes the chat transcript has been sent to about a hundred people on her <unk> and i tagged all of our mutual friends 
 the chat was also linked on her church page and her employers page 
 i also sent it to her parents for good measure as an <unk> 
 almost instantly my phone starts to blow up 
 i shut off my laptop shut off my phone and went out to my car to spend my last night in it 
 there 's not much i can say about the fallout that will do it justice more than what 's probably playing in your heads 
 sides were chosen legal threats were made <unk> happened death threats were thrown around 
 needless to say her reputation was completely ruined to the point that she not only had to delete all forms of social media but she had to move clear across the country to get rid of the stigma from the small town she grew up in 
 over the top 
 maybe 
 but it was so so sweet 
 it warms my heart on cold winter <unk> college my brother and i were taking a class together which was basically a public speaking <unk> <unk> 
 we had to attend 6 university forums 
 one night at the first one of these terribly dry presentations my brother and i were seated in the back of the auditorium near the entrance -- right next to a <unk> <unk> sign that read please no food or drink in the auditorium '' 
 out of <unk> we started picking the letters off of the board and <unk> them 
 the final result left the board reading old penis in the rum drink '' 
 this seemed like the best possible combination 
 we had a chuckle and forgot all about it 
 after leaving i realized i had left my keys under my seat so i went back inside only to find several faculty appalled at the public obscenities someone left on their precious sign 
 the most outwardly upset of the bunch coincidentally also happened to be my 80 year old statistics professor 
 he was a <unk> old fuck 
 it pleased me to see him <unk> perturbed so we made it a point to change the sign every week while attending the forums 
 week after week it became more challenging to ninja our way to 60 seconds alone with the sign as they had started <unk> <unk> it during the presentations 
 but week after week upon leaving the gathering everyone was again <unk> with old penis in the rum drink as they went home 
 it was a slow <unk> burn 
 on the final forum of the semester two of the old bastards <unk> the sign the entire night 
 so anticipating this we simply hand wrote several poster boards with our <unk> : old penis in the rum drink 
 and taped them all over the lobby walls 
 this caused the old professor and his <unk> gang to almost shit themselves 
 they ran around pulling down the posters as the student body exit the theater laughing at them hysterically 
 you see we had become a hero of the people 
 to put one final nail in this angry <unk> 's heart the morning before our statistics final my brother and i found our way into the classroom early pulled down the projector screen knowing it would not be used in class and left one final message written on the <unk> behind it 
 as class was starting in walks angry old dr. statistics he promptly <unk> the <unk> projector screen and bam 
 old penis in the rum drink i originally posted this story in /r/pettyrevenge but a few people pointed out that it might belong here as well so here it goes : a few years ago i was at my city airport about to board on a very short 50-minute long <unk> trip to another city 
 i did the whole procedure registered my tickets sent my luggage to be wrapped and stood still in the corner 
 now this is important : i was dressed with a white t-shirt and a black pair of pants looking really formal so i looked like someone from the airport staff <unk> because i was standing close to the airport map staring at nothing waiting for my flight 
 i heard a commotion in the hall next to the check-in area looked there and then i saw him : the asshole 
 dude was giving everyone in the airport - staff and passengers - a very hard time demanding priority in the check in service and making a huge scene 
 apparently he was too wealthy to just wait in line like everyone else 
 he screamed so much one of the staff girls actually cried 
 i heard he was trying to get a flight from <unk> to campinas two cities in <unk> which was exactly the flight i was in 
 so i saw an <unk> opportunity to avenge the poor girl and the rest of the staff : i went to the departure section and just stood still next to the place where you go to board the planes with those <unk> '' that connect the <unk> to the planes 
 this is what i mean i do n't know if usa <unk> have this kind of stuff 
 anyway i stood in the long corridor and when he came close to me i asked him are you sir flying to campinas or to <unk> de <unk> '' 
 campinas '' he said in that disgusting voice 
 that way '' i pointed to one of the <unk> entrance to my left 
 if he made past this point in the building it meant that somebody already checked his id and ticket 
 so nobody would question him when he got into the plane i pointed which means that he was not going to campinas 
 actually god knows where he might have ended up if he did n't realize he was in the wrong plane 
 tl dr : dude was being rude and violent in the airport <unk> him to the wrong plane to teach him a <unk> have a colleague who loves listening to his music on his computer 
 unfortunately his choice of music is some or other <unk> <unk> stuff that sets my teeth on edge 
 we 're in an <unk> office so music and additional noise are not welcome 
 when he first got a desk next to mine he played his music for a bit 
 i asked him to turn it down and he did - for a while 
 the next time it was back at the usual volume 
 so i gave him a spare pair of <unk> figuring that might be nice and subtle 
 he wore them once and then the music was back 
 fortunately i 'm a network admin at work so i have administrator access to his pc 
 i used a remote process-killing application to kill windows media player the moment he walked away from his pc 
 after this happened a number of times he switched to using itunes so i killed that too 
 then <unk> and then <unk> 
 it drove him insane 
 he 'd leave his desk and the music would stop 
 i even killed it remotely from home once or twice just so he would n't suspect me 
 eventually it all became a little <unk> and i <unk> his pc 's registry killing the sound card drivers and all sound on his pc ceased 
 he never figured that out he did reinstall windows recently a year later and the sound works but he has not played music since 
 my process-killing scripts are ready ... so this story is going to sound fucked up from the title but just to be clear the divorce was for legitimate reasons out of my control 
 i just happened to help the realization leading to it 
 at the private school i grew up in i became friends with dylan 
 now dylan and i became great friends because we both were class clowns and had a lot of fun with it 
 little did i realize dylan actually hated me and talked shit behind my back because he wanted to be the funniest kid in class '' and did n't like sharing that title 
 little did i know the amount of shit he would talk about me behind my back the crap he would say about my family my personality etc 
 etc 
 i was however frustrated with when he started putting on this tough guy attitude 
 since i do n't like fighting and prefer to settle <unk> with words he 'd always try and pick a fight with me knowing i 'd never fight back 
 my parents are disciplinary as fuck and would beat the hell out of me for anything like that so hell no am i fighting 
 he would apparently fuck with me whenever i invited him on birthday <unk> such as literally kicking my ass fucking with my toys etc 
 i assumed it was other friends but turns out it was him 
 but this is what truly set me off 
 i started getting a passion for art 
 almost any kind 
 because i was forced into math and science but art made me feel like i could be creative and have more control 
 i 'm still in math and science today but i love to sing cook draw and write 
 so one day i spent three hours in school drawing the greatest <unk> ever 
 the <unk> the colors and just overall this drawing was <unk> 
 i fucking love <unk> and this was my greatest accomplishment 
 so dylan takes my drawing and goes like oh this looks cool 
 i 'll take it '' 
 i save face and fake it like i do n't care and say oh whatever i can make a new one anyways '' 
 but it was clear from my eyes that i was pissed 
 so this bitch decides to fuck with me and say then i guess you do n't care if i do this '' 
 and tears up the fucking drawing 
 right in front of me 
 i spent so much time on that and it made me love drawing and he killed it 
 petey the <unk> i will fucking avenge you 
 once i was fuming a few weeks later some friends told me everything he 'd do 
 they felt guilty for hiding it and did n't want to anymore 
 i forgave them and told them it was all ok. but now i was <unk> mad 
 i was ready to strike 
 and upon petey 's grave i will lay a <unk> of dylan 's tears 
 a month or so later he invited me to his house for his birthday <unk> to fuck with me but i planned 
 for a 11 year old i was pissed off 
 little did he realize that my dad knew about how dylan 's mom and dad were starting to fight 
 having overheard this between my parents i knew what my revenge would be 
 at 3am i decided to sneak into his parents room and brought some lipstick i borrowed '' from my cousin 
 i went to some of his dad 's shirts in the back and put the lipstick on my lips and kissed the shirt collar all over the collar 
 i did this to a few shirts in the back part of the closet and then i quietly snuck back to the bathroom washed my lips off and then snuck back into bed 
 the next morning nothing had happened but apparently dylan wanted to prank me later after lunch 
 fortunately my parents planned on picking me up after breakfast and i silently left 
 a month or so later i hear my dad telling my mom how dylan 's parents are getting divorced because dylan 's dad cheated 
 i was shocked that my plan actually worked 
 turns out it worked but his dad was actually cheating 
 when his mom saw the lipstick marks on the collar she started looking through his email accounts and found a lot of interesting conversations '' in some of his secondary emails 
 and lastly she caught him in the act after all of this snooping and that naturally was the final straw 
 dylan became a really quiet kid after that and would rarely talk to anyone 
 he turned into a loner and teachers were having problems with him because of this too 
 apparently he became known as the boy with no <unk> '' because he 'd rarely ever speak or laugh or cry or anything 
 i got ta say i kinda hoped that his parents would just wind up having a fight or something small but when i wound up giving the step that led to everything <unk> ... well that surprised the hell out of me 
 but i still <unk> petey <unk> a couple of years ago i worked as a cdl driver for a small construction company in a <unk> little oil town in <unk> 
 right when i had my interview with them i knew they were real jerks by their <unk> but hey i needed money and was still going through flight school 
 the owner and his cronies would drive up in their huge trucks every morning and belittle anyone who did n't have a huge truck or be in their circle of <unk> with them 
 i drove a subaru since nobody had a cdl except one other guy i had to drive their crappy dump truck and pull a work trailer 
 this truck was n't licensed with dot and neither was the trailer 
 they would n't pass inspection so the cronies would drive out to the job site ahead of me and scout out any dot vehicles waiting to pull people over 
 if the coast was clear i would drive out to the job site 
 it gets worse 
 they also had a <unk> truck 
 this was a piece of equipment that would blast a jet of high pressure water into the ground to break it up and then suck up all the mud 
 it was primarily used to expose <unk> oil pipe lines to be later fixed and then suck up all the remaining contaminated mud after it was sprayed 
 it 's a <unk> wet vac 
 you could tell where a pipe was leaking because the ground turned grey and black 
 i had to drive this piece of equipment too 
 after the contaminated mud was sucked up i asked where the disposal unit was so i could dump it 
 i worked up in north <unk> before this and took <unk> classes about not to break the law with illegal dumping the douche management <unk> who were all brothers looked at me funny and said to just go dump it in a ditch '' 
 i was completely surprised and warned them of the consequences of doing that 
 they did n't care and said to just go dump it in the company lot '' then 
 basically a dirt field by the shop the general manager then followed me out to the lot and watched me dump it 
 i knew it was wrong and took pictures of the dump spot with my phone 
 to make a long story short this oil dumping happened three more <unk> all of which someone was with me in the truck to make sure i did it even after i warned them 
 all times i was able to <unk> take pictures with my phone 
 i started to be treated very poorly after about a month and a half of working there all because i warned them about the dumping and i did n't fit into their crowd 
 the manager would tell me to do a job a certain way and then another assistant manager would tell me to do it differently 
 when the manager got pissed i did it the other way the assistant manager would throw me under the bus and say i was n't compliant 
 one day i was pulling a <unk> trailer to a job to pick up a huge <unk> 
 the white trash crony loaded it completely wrong and non-compliant with dot <unk> 
 i changed the way it was loaded to be legal and the crony got mad and said it 's fine i 've been around trucks for years '' 
 ... <unk> though he was n't the one with a cdl 
 i told him i wanted to be legal in case i was pulled over and he went and told the higher up manager 
 the next day the manager fired me in front of all the co-workers because he said he did n't have a good feeling about me 
 i was pissed but had been looking for other jobs at this time so not too upset 
 i told him fine '' and turned in my equipment and left 
 the next day i emailed the epa about what happened and told them i had pictures 
 i also called the dot and told them all about the dodgy behavior and crap <unk> on the road 
 would n't you know it 
 the epa got back to me within a couple of days and i had three separate interviews with the same agents at my place 
 i showed them pictures and gave them gps <unk> 
 they went out to the dump sites and took pics of their own 
 they later had me come to their building and verify employees with pictures and said it was a serious case 
 i told them that i really reported the company out of spite even though i knew the dumping was illegal 
 they understood and were going to take it seriously 
 i 'm not sure what happened or what is going to happen 
 i know the dot would 've done an audit and <unk> them 
 the government can take it 's time to handle things so i have n't asked for updates with the epa 
 i know they were a little <unk> with that huge gold mine <unk> spill into the <unk> <unk> around the same time 
 i do have the agent 's cards and could call but i have n't yet 
 the owner and managers of this company were awful even despite my warnings 
 you do n't mess with the epa 
 karma 's going to catch up with them 
 tldr : a trashy construction company wanted me to illegally dump oil so i <unk> the <unk> on them 
 this is a two <unk> with a very <unk> ending posted originally in /r/idontworkherelady/ here where it was suggested that i post it here as well 
 **part <unk> so one day i am shopping at my usual supermarket 
 as i so often do i have my headphones in : so i do n't hear what 's going on round me 
 i primarily rely on my eyes to notice what is happening 
 anyway there i was all paid and putting my groceries into my bag when suddenly a dripping cup of potato salad appears in front of my eyes 
 dripping <unk> marinade into my bag and all over my groceries 
 i look up and see a red round angry face rraf saying something to me 
 so i pop out a <unk> 
 rraf : ... fucking now '' 
 at this point i did n't realize one thing : he was speaking english 
 as you can tell by this single sentence : where i live we speak a different language but as i speak and hear english almost all the time 
 i do n't realize that at the moment 
 me : huh '' 
 rraf : this potato salad is leaking 
 get me a new one 
 right fucking now you lazy fuck '' 
 me : um ... 
 why '' 
 his <unk> has n't really sunk in yet 
 rraf : that 's what you bag boys are supposed to do 
 you lazy fuck '' 
 okay now i have caught on 
 me : hey asshole i 'm not a bag boy '' 
 rraf : whatever you are get me a new potato salad '' 
 me : hey moron i 'm just shopping here '' 
 which was when he saw the potato salad in my bag 
 rraf : then just give me yours '' 
 <unk> <unk> my bag and forces his cup of potato salad into my hands 
 it 's covered in marinade '' 
 he made a disgusted face and tossed it back into my carefully packed bag 
 get me a new potato salad '' 
 i have had enough by then 
 i took my bag and walked into '' the store to dump his potato salad in a trash can 
 he turned even <unk> before i left the store 
 i ca n't even begin to rationalize how he could have reasonably thought that i was a bag boy 
 1. around here there are no bag boys 
 2. i was a <unk> black jacket 
 the supermarket employees all wear red <unk> 
 3. there were two other people packing their shopping bags 
 **part <unk> later that night as i arrived at my work i was introduced to my new manager : red round angry face 
 well fuck ... or not 
 his <unk> introduced him as the new temporary manager '' who would get the office into shape until a permanent manager '' would take over 
 turns out i do n't work there but i do work for rraf 
 neither of them realize : those are code words ... for me 
 i know the company ceo and almost everyone directly underneath him but there are a few layers of <unk> between them and me 
 i am officially an independent contractor with a fixed hourly rate that is independent of my work time day/night and the office manager is supposed to call me in as necessary 
 my secret is : i am the company <unk> 
 due to the nature of the company people in manager level positions have very generous severance packages ... unless they are fired for cause 
 i can see why they want to get rid of rraf 
 long story short : we both act as nothing happened but he schedules me to work full night shifts for a month which suits me perfectly fine given my hourly rate 
 the problem is : he was supposed to work these shifts instead of me 
 strike one 
 his computer does n't properly log his weekly reports because of a crappy security system 
 usually i help people with that but though luck 
 company headquarters flags him as non-compliant 
 strike two 
 finally a month in he calls me into his office and tells me that i am fired 
 that my services were no longer needed 
 never mind that i can not be fired without <unk> of the division manager 
 strike three 
 he was fired the day after 
 i was asked to <unk> him clearing out his office and was probably grinning like a moron the whole time 
 **tl dr : ** asshole tries to bully me into getting him a new potato salad starts his new job as my manager and is fired a month later losing a lot of money 
 **edit : ** to clarify rraf was n't a new hire he was a transfer from another office that headquarters wanted to gone as cheaply as <unk> on reddit for a while but i kid you not i just discovered this amazing subreddit yesterday 
 have i been living under a rock 
 anyway this is a pretty old story but it still makes me laugh when i think about it 
 a few years ago i was dating some guy for a few months 
 let 's refer to him as d-bag 
 d-bag had a quiet demeanor but enjoyed making me laugh and spending time with me 
 there was something sweet about him however there were times when i felt like sweet <unk> from it 's always sunny when she was dating lil kevin and could n't quite figure out if he had mental handicap 
 d-bag was n't the <unk> 
 he once texted me that <unk> has a lot of patients for me 
 i asked if he was a doctor 
 he said 'no i have so much patients for you that i will wait for you 
 le sigh 
 not to mention d-bag also had a slight <unk> and some serious <unk> eyes 
 now d-bag was sweet but at the same time there was something sketch about him 
 there were a few times when one of us would spend the night he 'd creep into the bathroom some time in the wee hours of the morning to make a <unk> phone call to somebody 
 now i am not an insecure little bitch who will quickly start throwing accusations i need concrete proof first so these were n't exactly red flags for me 
 but there was this one instance i heard him yelling over the phone at somebody from my bathroom 
 the yelling was a little muffled but it sounded like he was trying to reassure someone that he was n't doing anything bad or so that 's what the premise of the conversation seemed to be 
 i let that instance go and forgot about it a few days later 
 fast forward to a few days before d-bag 's birthday i am out with one of my <unk> for her birthday 
 we go to a local bar with a few friends and happen to see all of d-bag 's friends there but no d-bag in sight 
 i 'm a little distracted while out at the bar wondering why d-bag 's friends are all there but no d-bag 
 i obviously drink these feelings away and get super pissed drunk that i randomly end up making friends with one of my bff 's friends 
 let 's refer to this friend as accomplice 
 accomplice and i drunkenly hit it off 
 it also happens that accomplice lived closed by to me at the time so my bff suggests accomplice <unk> a ride with us back 
 during the car ride accomplice and i are both spewing a bunch of <unk> drunken statements on why is it that all the friends of the guy we are seeing was at the bar but the actual guy was not there 
 as we both come to the realization that the guy we are seeing could potential be the same guy we discover this is not the case 
 saved 
 although the air is clear of potentially dating the same guy accomplice asks which friend is it i 'm dating 
 i drunkenly yell d-bag 
 d-bag 
 it 's d-bag '' repeatedly followed by is that bad '' 
 she seems shocked by this but is reluctant to say what she knows about him 
 i end up dropping her home without finding any information regarding d-bag however accomplice and me exchange numbers 
 the next day i have plans to take d-bag for an early birthday celebration 
 some time in the afternoon i receive a text from accomplice asking if i have time to talk over the phone because she has something important to discuss 
 i 'm not busy so she quickly phones in 
 the conversation goes a little something like this : a : so ... remember last night how you said you were seeing d-bag 
 me : yeah ... .. 
 a : how long have you guys been seeing each other 
 me : a little over 3 months or so 
 a : oh ... me : is that bad 
 a : well ... okay 
 i 'm just going to come out and say this up front but d-bag has a girlfriend 
 they 've been together for over a year 
 me : ... son of a bitch turns out accomplice 's bff is d-bag 's girlfriend 
 this son of a bitch had me as the other woman 
 being someone 's option '' has never been my style so i am quite furious 
 accomplice and i devise a grand master scheme to expose d-bag 's cheating ways to his girlfriend that very night during the birthday celebration dinner i planned out 
 i make the arrangements that i will drive d-bag and me to dinner so in the end of the grand master scheme he will be stranded 
 but the grand master scheme itself 
 accomplice and i plan for d-bag 's gf to show up at the end of dinner 
 at <unk> i pick up d-bag from his house 
 my insides are crying with delight at the very thought of exposing this motherfucker but i must remain cool calm and collected while being in his presence 
 we get to the restaurant and have a great time 
 i am being extra nice and sweet to him asking him what does he want for his birthday and promising to take him out to a <unk> restaurant on his actual birthday 
 then we go on to talking about other things and we make this silly bet on how he 's never going to kiss me ever again and i say let 's bet on it because i know i 'm never going to kiss him again 
 he 's so clueless and is laughing about it like why would n't i ever kiss him and that he <unk> i will by the end of the night 
 i let out a laugh and say to him after dinner i have a surprise for you and it 's the reason why i ca n't kiss you '' 
 we go on <unk> about punishment and karma 
 he talks about how he believes he 'll get punished for bad things he 's done and will get his karma eventually 
 so i say you believe in karma 
 do you think you 'll get karma for cheating on your previous girlfriend '' 
 because he once told me he made the mistake long time ago of cheating on one but he was n't referring to current gf and he says yeah '' with no sadness to his face all innocence as if he 's been a real good guy since then 
 so i laugh ... and laugh ... and laugh some more 
 we get the bill and since i told him i 'll take him out on his actual birthday he covers our dinner 
 i text accomplice and let her know dinner is over 
 as a matter of fact i 've been texting accomplice throughout the entire night telling her my status and the silly things d-bag has been saying to me 
 at one point d-bag steps out for a phone call and when he gets back he tells me his sister called because she was wanted to know where her macbook charger is '' 
 accomplice texts me back saying he just called his gf to tell her that he 's out with his cousin buying shoes '' 
 sneaky right 
 or better yet ultimate douche bag liar right 
 so after he pays the bill i text accomplice saying be outside now 
 as we step outside i stop d-bag for a second and say remember how i said i have a surprise for you after dinner '' 
 he says yes ... and as we hit the corner boom his girlfriend is there cursing the shit out of him on what a sneaky cheating bastard he is 
 accomplice and i sit down and watch the entire fight while d-bag has no way of denying me since i am there in the flesh 
 and as the fight comes to an end accomplice and gf go their separate way i go my separate way and sad little d-bag is left at the restaurant with no ride home mind you this is way before <unk> days 
 and sure d-bag could 've easily taken public transportation or called one of his boys to pick him up but d-bag is a <unk> person who would n't want to be seen taking the bus and with the grand master scheme we also planned it on a day that all his boys went out to a city that was an hour away to hit up some club 
 short term redditer extremely fast <unk> 
 this is not my own story but my dad 's during his travel from florida to new york 
 my father <unk> to arrive on at time in anything in life 
 he 's a <unk> for that kind of thing 
 so to my amazement when he told me this awesome story of how he sought revenge although indirectly i was grinning ear to ear while listening 
 of course my father arrives on time to his flight 
 at boarding time the plane was a bit empty something like 2 or 3 rows was empty in the very back and my father loves to sit in the back because it 's less stressful and proven to be safer in the event a plane <unk> 
 so there is freedom to choose the seat you want and my father does so 
 bags put in the overhead <unk> empty seats on either side of him and life is bliss 
 that is until the plane is delayed 
 a minor inconvenience but nothing too <unk> 
 5 minutes pass delayed then 10 minutes then 20 then <unk> everyone on the plane is wondering why this damn plan wo n't take off 
 and then it happens a family of 5 which we 'll call the anuses father mother 2 sons and an infant board the plane 
 if you 've ever rode on a plane before you 'll understand that this is almost <unk> 
 planes love to take off on time and if you 're even 5 minutes late you will not be able to board said plane 
 so here goes the anuses boarding a plane 30 minutes after it 's suppose to have taken off 
 no problem 
 there are plenty of empty seats and we can finally get rolling 
 nope 
 the anuses walk directly to my father and the row he 's sitting in and says these are our seats '' 
 well of course my father <unk> that there are a <unk> of empty seats and they can just take one of those 
 nope 
 they want their seats on their tickets and was n't having it any other way 
 another thing about planes 
 it is federal law that all passengers must sit in their assigned seats in the case of a plane crash all the bodies can be accounted for and identified 
 although it 's not enforced that much 
 the anuses must have their seats so they call over a flight attendant now fa and explain their situation 
 the fa sides with them quoting the law and how my father must relocate 
 having lost my father then gets up collects his belongings and proceeds to move to another seat 
 the seat he chose 
 his seat on his ticket which is about 5 rows up and a middle seat 
 only problem is there is already someone sitting there 
 he tells the guy that it 's his seat and he 'd like to sit there now 
 the guy looks <unk> when fa <unk> in and says sir there are open seats in the back why do n't you just take one of those '' 
 the fuck 
 obviously <unk> at this point my father then says but you just told me to move out of my seat because it was theirs when there was also many seats available 
 now when i do the same there 's a problem '' 
 fa just says the same spiel again but my father does n't relent he wants his seat now 
 he <unk> the very law she used against him 
 fa defeated then asks the guy to relocate as well 
 this causes a domino effect and the guy goes to his assigned seat and asks to sit there so on so forth until the entire plane has been rearranged and this plane is now an hour and a half behind departure schedule 
 the delay in the flight now sets off some red alerts for airport security and the higher ups at this terminal jet blue i believe 
 airport police upper management and god knows who else are now at the terminal gate to inquire as to why this plane is still here 
 they board to plane to talk to the pilot about the delay and he says that he held the plane to let some late passengers on board 
 now that 's against policy because as stated before they like planes to be on time 
 they inquire a bit more as to the situation and it 's all explained by fa how they arrived late wanted their seats and then the whole plane had to be rearranged 
 pissed off that 1. the pilot held the plane to accommodate the anuses 
 2. the anuses then asked for their seats which caused a domino effect 
 and 3. it comes out that the anuses are in fact the pilots family brother or something which caused him to hold the plane in the first place they ask that the anuses leave the plane immediately because you should have never been on this plane from the beginning '' 
 reprimand the pilot for abusing his position and indirectly causing this entire fiasco and refund my father 's ticket because of the absurd requests by the anuses 
 the plane finally takes off 2 and a half hours later my father has a full refund about $ 500 and the anuses has to wait for the next flight this was all at 11pm 
 good flight 
 i think so 
 edit : people are commenting that it was their seats '' and they have every right to ask for them 
 yes you 're absolute correct in that aspect 
 but then you also comment that it was a full family and maybe they wanted to sit together 
 in this aspect no you 're wrong because as stated in the story there was 2-3 empty rows on both sides of the plane 
 if anyone has ever rode a plan there is usually 3 seats per row on either side of the plane 
 making it a total of 6 seats per aisle <unk> so there was a potential 12-18 seats available my father taking up 1 of those seats 
 it 's extremely unreasonable to arrive late then ask for my father to move when there was 17 other seats available 
 more than enough space for them to sit as a family 
 also i do not know when or how he bought his tickets but if he bought them late anyone who has ever bought a plane ticket before knows that you do n't have a choice in which seat you buy anymore 
 it 's first come first served and the reason the plane was that empty anyways was because it was a very late night flight 
 my father likes to board the plane last so when walking through the isle he saw his seat was taken to which he decided fuck it i 'll just go sit in the back because i was the last one on the plane and i know no one is going to come claim these seats 
 some also commented that the plane being delayed is up to the <unk> 
 unless you work for an <unk> its pretty safe to assume the reason the plane was held for 30 minutes was because the pilot held it for his late family to board to plane 
 edit 2 : grammar 
 plus no one is denying the fact that my father might also be an asshole in this situation 
 in my personal opinion taking revenge is n't taking the high road and anyone who <unk> to take revenge is <unk> an asshole in that given situation 
 very few stories on this prorevenge subreddit are they actually not assholes as well 
 2 assholes do n't make a saint but 2 assholes make a right 
 i had actually forgotten about this story until i read something similar on /r/pettyrevenge kind of a long one i am not sure if it belongs here but i have to say the effects were devastating for the victim of my wrath ... anyways here it goes 
 so there i was in 12th grade last year at last 
 top of my class very <unk> and non-confrontational little me had all the <unk> of a wild <unk> <unk> 
 enters <unk> shithead hs not just your common asshole at school nobody liked him in my class for very notable reasons : - compulsive liar - made fun of people in every way possible - massive hypocrite would preach how <unk> is for cowards but would be the first one to rat out other people 
 he was <unk> <unk> to me 
 i was the first to talk to him on his first day and we became friends or so i thought because after a few days i realized that he was just using me to get to know other people and escalate the social chain and what do you know he started making fun of me every chance he had 
 this went on for the rest of the school year and it was so frustrating to see him come to school every day i would celebrate <unk> in my head whenever he missed class which was rarely 
 but well that time of the year came again it was finals week but not any finals the finals 
 i should mention at this point that hs was a below average student and not bright at all in any of the subjects and he always tried to cheat on the tests 
 i was fairly prepared for the exams and even though the class was big somehow he ended up sitting close to me for the math exam 
 the exam starts and as the first 20 minutes pass hs 's little brain ca n't handle it anymore and he starts asking me questions <unk> and it suddenly came down on me like a bucket of cold water this asshole 's chance to graduate is in my hands you were not allowed to graduate unless you passed all courses at first i was reluctant to go through with it but then i remembered what a douchebag he was to me so i thought fuck it ... <unk> : hs : hey man whats the answer to number 3 
 lets imagine number 3 was a <unk> question the idiot still had to show work but whatever he wanted the answers me : it 's 9 <unk> pretty out of the line eh 
 i knew he would n't notice the change though because the questions were too complicated for him ... this continued and i gave him all the other answers to all of the questions all being bogus numbers i came up with at the end of the test he did n't even thank me i mean come on i just ruined your school year the least you could do is show <unk> 
 fast forward a couple of weeks later this guy failed the math class because of that final and he had to take math summer classes 
 naturally he failed them too and had to repeat the year 
 oh but not only that i caught a glimpse of him crying while his dad took him by the ear out of school to their car ... it was already enough satisfaction for me but after graduating and starting university overseas i went back to my country just to discover that he failed 12th grade again and dropped out of school he works in a local <unk> now and i plan to pay him a visit the next time i go back just so he can make me a sandwich 
 the moral of the story kids is never fuck with the person that you need help from 
 tl dr highschool bully needed help with his graduating final i gave him all the wrong answers and ruined his school graduation 
 edit : wow did n't expect to get this much attention 
 to the people wondering if he would spit on my sub he would n't because i would be able to see when he would be prepping it good thing he did n't work in another restaurant 
 a few decades ago i was serving in the navy stationed at <unk> training center to do some <unk> 
 we were all young there <unk> and everyone had been in the navy about a year at most 
 a few of us did drugs 
 not a lot just dropped acid once a month or so usually <unk> 
 being in a strange place <unk> was tough to get sometimes 
 we were all cool and kept it quiet 
 we were all decent students good friends and everyone there looked out for one another 
 then there was redneck randy 
 randy was from a small southern town where his unusual surname family were <unk> <unk> and very well known 
 coming from a being a big fish in a small pond randy was entitled 
 i mean entitled to the point of being a sociopath 
 constantly borrowing money without <unk> it <unk> everyone 's notes for class getting duty switched around to favor his plans 
 he even <unk> his giant pickup truck in the base parking lot 
 just grade-a douchebaggery 
 <unk> he even bragged to me one time that his grandfather was <unk> 
 * '' i ai n't ashamed to say my <unk> wore a sheet '' 
 * well after a few months randy stopped going to class 
 he was still in the barracks but he never <unk> for school or marched to class with us 
 when asked about it randy said he 'd been moved to an <unk> program elsewhere on base working on a project for the navy 
 we all just assumed he 'd entitled himself into another gig 
 which he had 
 you see randy had become a <unk> 
 ** around this time he also suddenly began talking about drugs 
 not <unk> me drugs <unk> talk more like how many drugs he 'd done in his life how many piss tests he 'd cheated how easy it is to get away with drug use 
 that kind of thing 
 we realized later he 'd been <unk> the <unk> for <unk> himself into the circles of those who did do drugs ... .a group he never really associated with except to borrow money or notes 
 after a few weeks of this he had himself a fish my roomie 
 roomie told me randy had met a guy in another barracks who sold a bit of acid and would be willing to part with a sheet if we 'd keep it quiet 
 randy had bought from this guy many times and swore he was legit 
 although we avoided randy he kept pestering roomie into buying until roomie said ok. roomie went to go meet the <unk> one day after class and wound up in handcuffs 
 if i had n't had duty that day *i 'd have been in handcuffs too 
 * we quickly put the pieces together 
 skipping class his talking about drugs him <unk> us to buy 
 randy even <unk> his roommate to secrecy and admitted he had done this to avoid a bad conduct discharge 
 he 'd been caught with cocaine and talked the base police into working as a <unk> to <unk> his punishment 
 his roommate told us this and informed us randy was getting discharged in a week himself 
 why did his roommate tell us 
 fucking randy had casually offered to turn him onto some stuff a month earlier 
 and his roommate did n't even use 
 randy just needed a victim and anyone would do 
 on the day randy was supposed to get discharged he parked his truck next to the barracks 
 too lazy to carry his stuff all the way around to the lot he 'd toss his stuff out the window and walk around the barracks to pick it up and put it in the truck 
 i watched him toss two seabags outside from my window two doors down 
 when i heard the door slam i jumped out the window and threw them into my room 
 by the time randy got around the building his stuff was gone 
 if the story stopped here it would have been posted in r/pettyrevenge 
 but it does n't 
 you see later that night when randy was driving back home we opened his seabags 
 aside from a cd player and a case full of led <unk> cds the seabags were mostly clothes 
 mixed in with those clothes though were randy 's discharge papers including his dd214 
 underneath those we found randy 's address book and i shit you not a phone book from his county down south 
 it did n't take long for the 4 of us to formulate the plan 
 our fury at randy was the fuel that ran the engine of our retribution 
 we called everyone in the address book and told them what randy had done 
 his parents his siblings his aunts uncles and cousins all got a call 
 we called former employers and old friends of his 
 about half of the numbers were girls in town randy was quite the ladies man 
 they all got a call 
 we had <unk> his dd214 & amp <unk> report and offered to send a copy to anyone who did n't believe us 
 only four took us up on it 
 his family members & amp former employers got a copy anyways 
 the only people we <unk> were his grandparents 
 that was the address book 
 from there we moved onto the white pages 
 almost everybody with unusual surname in the county got a call 
 we typed up the story at the base library and made about <unk> copies 
 they along with copies of the dd214 & amp arrest report got sent out to any business in town with unusual surname as well as any business we thought might be associated with randys family 
 hell we even sent a few copies to some businesses we saw were next to unusual surname business 
 every law firm in town got a copy as did the local paper 
 three people on randys street got a copy 
 for the grand finale we called the local police department pretended to be base police and informed them of the incident reminding them he would be returning to their area in a few days 
 they got a copy of the arrest <unk> too of course 
 when all was said and done we made about 60 calls and sent out about 70 copies to the people & amp businesses of randys small southern county 
 we had a dozen or so copies left so i mailed them to randy himself over the course of 6 months one every few weeks 
 i mailed the last one the day i left for my ship 
 naturally all those telephone calls and <unk> got to be kind of expensive 
 luckily i had plenty of money from selling randy 's cd player to a guy three barracks over 
 the cds were thrown away 
 i fucking hate led <unk> 
 **tl dr- * '' take advantage of the enemy 's <unk> travel by unexpected routes and strike him where he has taken no precautions 
 * -sun <unk> night i was on my way home from work and needed to stop at a gas station 
 this gas station was right off a very busy <unk> interstate highway and had an attached convenience store as most do 
 it was dark out when i pulled up i started <unk> my gas and was headed to the store when another customer stopped me 
 his truck was at the pump across from me 
 he went on a sob story about how he just got a ticket for not having money to pay the tolls being completely out of gas and needing to get home since he accidentally took all of his infant son 's formula with him when he left 
 there was a woman with him looking through a diaper bag while he related his tale of <unk> and right when he mentions the formula she yells yeah all the formula is in here 
 what were we thinking 
 we really need to get back '' 
 she said her wallet should be in the bag somewhere but after dumping the contents inside the truck cabin she <unk> that it was n't there 
 so yeah obviously they were looking for me to give them money 
 for some stupid reason i decide to give them the benefit of the doubt 
 i go into the store take out $ 20 from the atm and give it to them 
 in retrospect this was such a textbook example of the stranded driver scam but i guess i was really naive 
 but then instead of just thanking me for the money this brazen son of a bitch responds thanks but we really need another $ 20 to make it home 
 any way you could get more '' 
 he also promised he 'd mail the money back to me if i gave him my name address and phone number 
 at that point i begin to regret giving him anything as all the red flags are registering in my mind at once 
 both of these people were very <unk> -- greasy hair very poor teeth consistent with meth use dirty clothes 
 the man 's pupils were <unk> a lot more than would be expected under the bright lights of the gas station and he was especially twitchy 
 <unk> the woman was <unk> around muttering to herself in feigned concern 
 so yeah they were both probably high 
 also looking at the contents of the diaper bag <unk> across their truck 's interior there was plenty of trash but no baby formula 
 i thought to myself if i 'm going to ruin these people 's night i needed to be sure so i agree to get more money but first ask him : can i see the citation you got 
 my cousin is a state <unk> and could probably take care of it for you 
 i just need some of the information on it '' 
 as i jot down his licence plate number on my phone he checks his pockets before saying oh hmmm 
 i have no idea what i did with it 
 it 's ok i 'll just pay it 
 no big deal '' 
 *so you do n't have money for gas but paying more than $ 100 on a traffic ticket is no big deal 
 bull 
 shit 
 * i now also noticed the state of his license plate did n't match up with his story 
 pissed at myself i 'm making my way back into the store and the wheels in my head are spinning : <unk> can i get back at this asshole 
 * have them kicked out 
 <unk> then they 'll just go to another gas station and <unk> someone else 
 * call the police 
 *eh they might not get here in time 
 * i 'm a few feet from the door when genius strikes 
 i turn and call over to him : if you want you can take my ez pass for the tolls 
 i do n't really need it anymore 
 it 's right on the dashboard the door should be unlocked '' 
 oh that 'd be great 
 thanks '' 
 i go into the store and pretend to use the atm while i 'm actually using an app on my phone to cancel my ez pass 
 i report their fraudulent activity to the attendant and hurry back outside 
 i told the man i could n't take any more money out of my account sorry 
 he 's disappointed but did n't press me 
 i 'm grinning like a smug idiot on the inside get into my car notice the transponder is gone and drive off 
 i pull over a few minutes down the road and call the ez pass office 
 by some stroke of luck they 're open late that day and i 'm able to speak with an actual person 
 i explain to her that when i got into my car just now i noticed the transponder was gone 
 i already cancelled it but wanted to make sure it was all set 
 she confirms that it 's deactivated and i can come pick up a replacement for a small fee 
 *eh not today 
 * she asks and i tell her where and by whom i suspect the transponder was taken giving her their license plate number and address of the gas station 
 she promises to pass the information along to the state police 
 perfect 
 a day or so later the state police call me to say they 've recovered my transponder and needed me to come in to give a statement 
 of course i obliged 
 while there i tried to pry more information on the fate of the con artists but they were n't very <unk> at all 
 luckily i told my cousin the story and she said she 'd look into the case for me 
 according to the report they got cctv footage from the gas station showing me giving the man money and then him taking my transponder when i went back into the store 
 afterwards the meth heads got back onto the interstate and stopped at the nearest rest stop where they presumably tried their scheme again before moving on to the next one to repeat the process 
 eventually they got off the toll road and onto a different highway 
 when they drove through the ez pass toll lane they got flagged for not paying and were pulled over a few miles away 
 at this point i was satisfied having caused them to get a & gt $ 100 citation but that was n't the end of it 
 the cop notices something 's up with the driver and calls for backup 
 when they arrive the police officer gave the guy a field <unk> test which he failed and was arrested 
 while this is going on the woman flipped out and started running 
 she does n't make it far before they catch up to her <unk> she <unk> arrest 
 all in all the guy was charged with dui not his first time either possession they had some meth in the truck theft by deception for the $ 20 i gave them and theft for the transponder 
 the truck was impounded and the guy got a large fine for operating without insurance along with the ~ $ 100 fine for not paying the toll 
 the woman was charged with possession and resisting arrest she also had a record 
 all in all pretty sweet revenge 
 they ended up only being tried for the <unk> charges but i 'm still very satisfied with that along with the fines 
 it gave my cousin the cop a good laugh <unk> few decades ago i worked it for an up-and-coming tech firm 
 it was a good place and i enjoyed working there however the company finances were chronically lean which occasionally resulted in some <unk> 
 as a result i was n't surprised when an announcement was made that there would be a wage freeze and that all dept 
 budgets were being cut 
 what made this financial episode <unk> was how a senior vp dealt with it ... it happened that the vps & amp ceo had been <unk> taking some bonuses <unk> due them i 'm not sure of the specifics but apparently the <unk> had gone on too long and the company finally had to pay them out 
 to <unk> <unk> among the <unk> the vps were told in no uncertain terms that they were to keep the news of the payments quiet one vp however went out and bought an expensive high-end european sports car and started driving it to work - this in turn raised some eyebrows among those whose <unk> pay increases had been put on hold and whose department budgets has been slashed 
 this vp was also more trouble for the it dept 
 than the rest of the company put together about this time there was one particularly unpleasant interaction where he 'd gone off on us due to a problem he 'd been experiencing for a few weeks due to his own <unk> and <unk> to cooperate with us to try & amp fix it 
 this last episode was one which justified payback ... our parts cabinet soon contained a 10 <unk> <unk> and a bottle of castor oil about once or twice a week one of us would happen to squirt a <unk> of castor oil up the <unk> of his new car 
 the result of this was when the exhaust pipe of the car heated up enough to burn off the castor oil the car would <unk> a massive <unk> of <unk> smoke 
 since he lived close to work the pipe would n't heat up enough to start smoking during his commute making it seem to happen randomly 
 needless to say this took the enjoyment out of the pricy new toy he was showing off 
 given his personality it was a given that he 'd go back to the dealer and read them the riot act when they could n't find anything wrong with the car eventually they did find something to fix '' which was n't covered by warranty and apparently cost him a sizeable chunk of change 
 the <unk> '' then ceased for a few weeks only to start up again by this time he was disgusted enough with the car that he sold it at a bargain price just to be rid of it 
 the new owner got a great deal - the castor oil did n't damage the car at all since it was at the end of the exhaust pipe and <unk> of all <unk> etc 
 edit- spelling clarity asshole neighbors have a habit of turning music right up loud every weekend 
 with a shared ceiling thin walls and their <unk> to go off and threaten us when we ask them to turn it down i found a tiny simple solution <unk> switched <unk> off got my phone on edge and browsed some heavy sites while moving it around the wall 
 bingo found a place that makes that delicious <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of an edge connection through their speakers and let it do its thing 
 radio went off within 5 minutes and every time it goes up again back comes the edge 
 bliss 
 have n't heard it above a <unk> <unk> me start off by saying that i love my dog 
 this story starts a couple years ago in a small but very nice and quiet neighborhood 
 most people own their homes and everyone takes pride in ownership besides the house next to <unk> house next to mine is section <unk> meaning government <unk> pays all the bills and usually some form of trash lives there 
 this certain piece of trash this story is about well let 's call her fraggle rock because she looks like one 
 this bitch moves in and immediately starts partying 
 i mean like an every day all day booze and drug fest 
 she is selling pills smoking crack and doing heroin on her back porch throwing trash drug bags everywhere all over my property brings her druggie crew around my house and keeps my family up really late with there <unk> 
 i really dislike her at this point but i ignore her 
 her boyfriend is extremely violent and they beat each other constantly the 4 year old child she has is dirty looking neglected with behavior problems and has to witness this shit 
 it was awful but none of my business 
 i spoke to the fraggle one time when she first moved in 
 i explained i had a really big dog and to just ignore her as she <unk> a lot but will eventually get used to her like she had with the other neighbors 
 we were actually removing a swing set off of the property line when i spoke to her 
 our 6 foot privacy fence was put up about 15 foot away from where our property actually ended and i seen she had a small child and i did not want to get sued because her child got hurt on it my property 
 the landlord lives in a different state and is very <unk> 
 he is also an asshole 
 fast forward a couple months most of my family went on vacation to another state for an entire month and as soon as i returned not even 2 hours later i am <unk> suite cases from the trunk of my car mr. out of state landlord comes by and says his tenant is complaining about me looking in her windows and we need to stay on our side of the fence 
 that brings about an <unk> first of all i can be on my property all i want 
 2nd of all we have been out of state for a month and have n't been on that side of our property since the fraggle moved in and we removed the swing set 
 i told the landlord i will be moving my fence closer to the property line 
 i am unsure where all the accusations came from her crack smoking probably had everything to do with her bogus claims 
 i was now agitated with this bitch and she even went as far to call city <unk> the day i started moving my fence after we called her over and showed her our survey spikes 
 around this time i noticed our <unk> who was treated badly by previous owners and <unk> like a guard dog has taken a particular <unk> for them so i start watching out my window when i hear her growling 
 i wish i had n't seen what i saw ... one of her daily regular buyers was jamming a stick through my fence and into my dogs face 
 he actually broke my fucking fence doing it 
 i ran outside and screamed you fucking asshole you will fucking pay for this '' 
 i was upset and my dog had a mark on her face 
 he ran inside and i seen the fraggle peeking out from behind her <unk> fucking laughing 
 the very next day the little boy is beating on my fence with a hammer and my dog is on the other side flipping out 
 i yelled at him to get his mother now but she would not come out to talk to me 
 a few more days later the kid is throwing dirt into my dogs eyes over my fence 
 the next day he is back with the hammer 
 i go to city hall and ask the lady there to contact the landlord asap and give him my phone number 
 i never got a call back 
 another incident happens with the same original drug buyer friend of hers he is smoking a blunt with the little child only feet away and my dog is barking 
 i am right there in my back yard and see and smell it all 
 he kicked a big ass hole in my fence and actually kicked my fucking dog 
 that was it 
 i had it 
 i went to the <unk> not something i would normally do but i did not want to lose my dog when one of these asshole gets bit 
 i talked to the cop we discussed the entire situation the parties drug deals the domestic violence and he told me the only way to get her out since she was section 8 and the landlord was <unk> was to call in her drug deals and she would be kicked off government assistance as soon as she was convicted 
 it only took one day of calls and i shit you not 17 fucking calls the first day all with license plate numbers 
 the next day i heard her yell talking to one of her drug <unk> girlfriends her voice was always loud and <unk> so i can hear and understand most of her outside conversations from my living room about a bunch of her friends getting locked up the day before and she did n't understand why or how this was happening 
 at this point i believe the cops called cps 
 they started coming around but she was not answering the door 
 one day she left the child unattended and he was playing on the main street 
 a family around here noticed and walked the little boy home but no one was home to watch him 
 cps was waiting out front this time 
 she somehow still had her kid after that but not for long 
 there was one more incident with my dog 
 a different druggie friend decided it was a good idea to <unk> my dog with rocks 
 i could n't believe this was happening still and was beside myself the hell i was going through 
 i was in my yard all the time because i had to be it was a serious inconvenience to be in the yard every time my dog wanted to be outside but i felt it was the only way to make sure these people did n't harm her 
 i lost my mind that last time and started pelting this guy back with rocks 
 the fraggle was on her back porch knocked out and she <unk> briefly to let out a <unk> the pig laugh like it was a fucking game 
 the fraggle likes to drink and drive 
 since the drug deals only got her buddies busted and not her i decided i would wait and watch and call in her next drunk driving adventure 
 she had to go 
 it did n't take very long 
 a few days later her violent scum bag boyfriend stole her purse and jumped into a car that was waiting and took off 
 i heard her scream my pills give me my fucking pills '' 
 i see her stumble to her car completely shit faced hop in and peel wheels in hot pursuit 
 i call it in 
 the poor child was outside in the snow <unk> 
 that is a perfect example of her <unk> 
 the cops arrested her and i knew that because cps came the next day after the child never went to school 
 they found the little boy there all alone just how he had been the whole night 
 the bitch was too worried about getting in trouble to disclose to the cops she left the <unk> a 4 year old home alone 
 really sad but hopefully he has a new family now or at least will one day 
 the fraggle returns a day later 
 no car and she stops going to whatever job welfare forced her to have 
 the violent boyfriend must have been in jail still from her purse snatching incident because there 's a new scumbag boyfriend hanging around with track marks visible a mile away 
 well violent boyfriend gets out of jail and runs up in the house 
 i seen the whole thing as my doggy is freaking out 
 dope head boyfriend and violent boyfriend start fighting 
 there is a bat and blood 
 i decide this is my chance to get the cops in the house and finally get these fucking pieces of trash out 
 it was a <unk> cops come guns drawn dope head runs inside and violent bf runs through the other neighbors yard 
 in the end they all went to jail 
 unfortunately it was n't the complete end when she got out of jail she smashed the back window and squatted there for about a week 
 i did n't bother calling the cops because i knew the house was getting damaged and it felt good knowing the landlord would have to fix it and section 8 will not pay for damages 
 fraggle is gone 
 i 've seen her once around town 
 she 's living on the streets 
 lost everything and she really had it all and her life was so easy living off the government 
 i told that fucking bitch not to fuck with my dog 
 she should have listened 
 before i got clean i bought most of the <unk> i was hooked on from my friend 's husband 
 she had a good heart but he was a giant turd 
 eventually he ripped me off 
 i paid he said he 'd have pills soon i never heard from him 
 when i called to check he got hostile said some nasty things refused to give me anything i was n't surprised but i was furious and i never saw him again 
 i was the <unk> at our local newspaper at the time 
 one morning on my way to work i passed his house and saw a bunch of cop cars in his driveway lights flashing 
 i was super curious and admittedly hoping he was in trouble for something and when i got to the newspaper i went straight to our police reporter and asked him about the cops 
 he had no idea so he checked a source 
 it turned out to be something mostly trivial i 've forgotten the specifics and then asked me what the big deal was 
 this reporter happened to be a good friend so i happily explained that the house belonged to my former drug dealer who had ripped me off and was a giant turd 
 i said something along the lines of you should print something about how awful he is '' 
 after i finished ranting about it i said adios and went upon my day 
 if anything i expected a <unk> brief under police news 
 instead the next morning 's paper included a <unk> article covering the previous day 's events at my dealer 's house and then <unk> recounting all his previous criminal activity in detail 
 his full name and address was mentioned over and over and it was the best thing <unk> years ago i had a coworker who was absolutely worthless 
 she called in sick at least every other week with some <unk> was always out running around chatting and <unk> instead of working and just generally leaving the rest of us to fill in for her 
 another coworker who i will refer to as fed up '' were really sick of dealing with her because we were the ones expected to take her calls and take care of her customers when she was out or away from her desk 
 i had complained loudly and often to my manager to no avail 
 for some reason she took it as if i were challenging her authority rather than believing i had a legitimate complaint 
 one day she basically told me she was sick of hearing about it i obviously had a personality conflict and to drop it or else 
 well i dropped it but i was pissed 
 finally one week everything came to a head 
 worthless '' handled one of our large clients and we were getting a lot of calls from their customers 
 so many in fact that my supervisor told me and fed up that we needed to help worthless because she could n't possibly handle all the calls 
 i was livid 
 maybe if she spent her time at her desk instead of running all over the office she could handle the calls 
 anyway i did what i was told but i <unk> the whole time 
 worthless was also in the habit of leaving early every day 
 at about 20 min to closing she 'd shut down her computer and go sit in another coworkers office and <unk> for 10 minutes and then they would leave together while i was still working 
 one afternoon after she left i still had about 10 of her <unk> calls so i sent them back to her desk 
 i figured if she had time to leave early she had time to return her own calls 
 well apparently the next day worthless <unk> to the boss because she came to see me about the phone calls 
 i 'd had it 
 i told my boss exactly what happened and why i sent the calls back 
 i guess this time she agreed with me because we did n't have to help her with calls anymore 
 the whole time this was going on worthless was bitching nonstop about this client 
 she was so pissed about having to take all these calls and <unk> all the time 
 well she decided to vent on facebook and idiot that she is made <unk> comments about one of our biggest clients online 
 as if that 's not bad enough she was friends with at least 20 coworkers all of whom saw her rant 
 most of them were friends in facebook name only because in reality very few people could stand her 
 so one of her friends '' screenshotted the page printed it out and gave it to fed up 
 we then mailed the screen shot of her rant to the hr manager from outside the office and sat back and waited 
 two days later worthless was escorted from the office 
 rumor has it that hr had her termination paperwork ready before they even called her in 
 edited to fix some typos and make the story read a little more <unk> apologize if this if overly long 
 i am trying to <unk> it as much as possible without losing too much of the feeling of the story 
 my story started the day before orientation into my college program 
 you see i applied for a very competitive program and never received an acceptance letter till the day before class started 
 i was also working the day it arrived so i never really got the letter till that evening 
 after some begging and pleading i managed to convince the dean of the department - a heartless <unk> bitch of a woman - to not count that absence against me 
 this program had a strict attendance policy where you were given three <unk> days a semester and would be kicked out on the fourth 
 they made this very clear and i did n't want to take any chances so i fought for that first day 
 a little over a month into the program i was asked to go see the dean 
 i had been sick for two days prior and i assumed she was going to give me a warning about the attendance policy - others i knew had the talk with her already 
 when i got into her office she asked for my security badge 
 i handed it over slightly confused 
 she then says i 'm sorry to tell you but you 've broken the attendance policy and can no longer attend class in this department '' 
 i was irate 
 my eyes were watering from a combination of fear rage and confusion 
 i explained that i only missed two days 
 she tells me i missed the two sick days which i did she mentioned that i also missed orientation which i did but she said she would n't count against me and then she said i missed a fourth day which i actually could prove i did n't with a signed and dated test i took that day 
 i explained this to her and told her to look at the test which i still had with me 
 she ignored my proof 
 i kept trying to talk some sense and reason into this <unk> <unk> 
 i made sure to point out that i just spent $ 5000 on tuition and $ 2000 on <unk> 
 she did n't care 
 she did n't interrupt me but she was n't listening 
 when i stopped talking she says you can leave now '' 
 the confusion and fear subsided and the rage <unk> 
 i blacked out for a moment and literally wiped my arm across her desk ensuring nothing was left on it when i was done 
 i broke her picture frames and <unk> she had and even managed to crack her laptop 
 i stormed out knowing security would be there very shortly 
 i went directly to the administration office to get a refund that is when i realized she did this the day after refunds would be given 
 that smug cunt scammed me 
 even more pissed i decided to go to our off campus pub where i had planned on meeting some friends later 
 i was in there a couple of hours when one of my professors walked in 
 she was a younger professor and attractive 
 i had been flirting with her since i started the program so i could be on her good side when it comes time for <unk> 
 she tells me she just heard i was kicked and my friends in class said i would probably be at the pub 
 she tells me she has seen the dean pull this stunt a few times and never really thought about what was happening until now 
 the dean was scamming students by kicking one out after refund deadline and bringing another in - ultimately getting double the tuition for a single seat 
 i was slightly drunk and my now former professor said that i needed to meet her the next day 
 so i assumed she had a plan i hoped she had a plan 
 the next morning my former professor arrived and i hopped in her car 
 i drove to another college in the same city my second choice but equally good 
 i figured she was going to use a connection to get me into a program and i was right 
 but that 's not where it ended 
 her former <unk> was also a lawyer and happened to work at this college 
 we sat down and explained the situation to him and he agreed that we have a case - at least to get my money back 
 he wrote up a letter to the dean of the department on my behalf 
 we sent it through registered mail 
 within 48 hours of sending that out i received a phone call from the lawyer telling me that the dean has agreed to refund my money in full for <unk> 
 i was happy with that outcome but still felt like she was getting away with doing this to other people 
 i explained my <unk> to the lawyer and we devised a plan 
 my former professor was sent an email every time someone was kicked so that she did n't allow them into her classes 
 all professors got this 
 she sent me all of them and i tracked down the 30 most recent ones and found that 16 of the 30 were in the same situation 
 the lawyer and i compiled a list of those names <unk> a letter on their behalf and sent it to the dean of the department and the president of the college 
 this time it took a few weeks but we were both asked to go in for a meeting 
 we got in and the dean was there along with several board members and school lawyers 
 we told our story and the dean had her chance for a <unk> 
 in it she explained that she was being nice by returning my money since i missed four days 
 expecting this i had the proof that i did not miss one of those days and presented it to everyone in the room 
 the meeting ended on that note 
 a few days later the lawyer was called by the president of the school 
 the school had terminated the dean for breaking the schools ethical policies 
 they also agreed to contact each of the students she had personally kicked out for false reasons and refund them their tuition in full 
 i was so excited that i called my former professor to tell her the good news 
 i took her out for dinner to thank her for all of her help in this situation 
 we dated for a few months after that dinner 
 while we were dating we heard the former dean took a much lower paying job in a much less <unk> city 
 **tl dr** school <unk> me for false reasons to get double tuition for each seat in the program 
 i get her fired i get myself and several other students full refunds and i date one of my hot former professors 
 someone told me to share this here my little brother is probably one of the most kind and <unk> kid i know 
 one of those people who would rather let a spider outside rather than end its life 
 i on the other hand am a cruel and <unk> person when it is needed 
 i 'm 5 years older than my brother and was in high school at the time so i would get home about 30 minutes before he would 
 we lived within walking distance of our schools so everyday we walked rather than take my car good exercise 
 one day my brother gets home with some unusual bruises on his forehead and arms 
 after some poking and <unk> he finally told me that some older shit heads follow him home on their bikes and punch him on occasion 
 this did not sit well with me 
 in fact my blood <unk> just <unk> this event 
 instead of letting my fury get the better of me and simply beating the spit out of them i decided to formulate a plan 
 the next day i waited for them a couple of blocks away from my house envelope in my hand until i finally saw them riding behind my little bro 
 i could already hear their little mouths spewing so much shit their assholes must 've been jealous 
 i approached them my brother sees me and stops a look of worry and confusion on his face 
 i give him a <unk> smile 
 i walk up to the ring leader and extend my hand with the envelope drawing his attention away from his front tire 
 in my best <unk> voice i say yo man i 'm having a killer party this weekend 
 here is the address and shit '' 
 the look of awe and happiness that came over his face was priceless 
 being invited to a high school party was a big deal back then i guess i should mention that as he was accepting my party invite all while telling me how pumped and excited he was he failed to notice me nonchalantly jamming a small but solid piece of wood into his bike <unk> 
 he began to pedal but is quickly <unk> 
 with a squeal of terror his face met the ground with a sound i will remember until the day i die 
 he cried lost a tooth and did something nasty to his nose 
 his posse '' ran to his aid 
 i <unk> my brother on the head and asked him how his day at school was as we walked home 
 never had any problems after that ... also the envelope contained a piece of paper that said fuck you '' 
 **tl dr** bullies harass and abuse my brother on his walks home from school i sabotage one of their bikes and the asphalt sexually assaults his <unk> is a <unk> from /r/pettyrevenge i made over a year ago before this subreddit existed 
 this is definitely a more pro than petty revenge story 
 -- -- i apologize for <unk> and if this one is a little too technical 
 this involves a somewhat popular <unk> trading game mtg 
 i tried to strip out as many unnecessary details as possible to make it easy to read 
 plus i don’t remember them all 
 i usually am not the one to take revenge since i’m <unk> 
 however in this case i found it was the most logical thing to do since i knew ahead of time that the other guy was going to try and screw me 
 there was this fellow in my high school 
 his name was david 
 he was one grade above me and he was a complete asshole a compulsive liar and a compulsive cheater 
 often times during lunch hour students would get together at the tables to play card games and such 
 i usually got involved in these games as well 
 david did too but not as often 
 when he did i watched him 
 honestly this kid fascinated me since he was completely blatant about his lying and cheating 
 i remember distinctly watching him play a game of magic : the gathering with another student and i would watch him take 2 3 even 4 cards at a time when he should have only been drawing 1. his opponent was completely oblivious to this and was so concerned about her own cards to really pay attention to what david was doing 
 i just kept my mouth shut 
 pretty soon he had something like 20 cards in his hand while his opponent had <unk> it was very ridiculous 
 i usually avoided playing with him but i must have played with him at least once 
 he would continue to cheat in the open until you called him on it 
 of course he would try to lawyer himself out of it or tell me i got it wrong 
 he would try to change the rules of the game to benefit him in the moment for his specific situation 
 he would throw a fit if you tried to argue and would only back down if you got the whole audience to agree unanimously that he was wrong 
 playing him was an <unk> experience since you spend more time arguing and watching him than playing the game 
 it was <unk> at the time and i had played some magic : the gathering mtg 
 i was nearly finished with this game since all the great expansions came out before i even got involved and people with money held all the power cards 
 i had dropped my own money in the new <unk> <unk> <unk> which turned out to be one of the worst expansions ever made in the <unk> history 
 therefore i was pretty sour and was basically giving up the game since i didn’t see how i could ever catch up 
 a guy i knew alex decided to organize a starter pack tournament where the players had to compete with only the cards they got with the starter pack 
 this sounded like an interesting <unk> on the game and i thought i might join to try and squeeze some fun out of this game i was quickly losing interest in 
 <unk> david joined this tournament 
 now his reputation was well known by alex but he let david join anyway 
 the logic being that he needed people even if those people were assholes 
 there was only something like 5 people in the tournament so it was hard to argue with that 
 can you guess whom my first match was against 
 that’s right 
 it was fuckface himself : david 
 now i didn’t want to lawyer and argue with david the whole game since that was no fun at all 
 if i was going to play him i wanted to completely <unk> screw him over and embarrass him in front of the whole player tournament 
 a sort of <unk> revenge for the shit i know he was going to pull on me 
 knowing that he was going to cheat ahead of time gave me some unique opportunities 
 i felt it relieved me of any ethical obligation to play a fair game 
 i needed to stack the deck in my favor so to speak 
 let me explain what i did 
 so each player was given a starter pack and one <unk> pack mtg <unk> edition for those who care 
 this gave you an assortment of cards that made overall fairly weak decks 
 most games resulted in waiting for the person to get enough land to play a monster and start doing damage against their opponent 
 any sizeable monster in play usually results in that player winning since our decks were so weak 
 in order to give yourself a chance of getting the right cards you need to strip out all the <unk> that was going to do you no good 
 so your cards were divided into your active playing deck and your reject pile 
 you only played with your active deck 
 at the end of the game the winner gets to draw at random a card to keep from the <unk> active deck or your reject pile 
 it’s the <unk> choice 
 this is important later 
 my deck had an unusually useful card for this sort of tournament called a demonic tutor 
 it essentially lets you go through your own deck and pick out the exact card you want 
 if i ever got this card it would be my key to winning since i could pick out the only monster i have that actually does damage 
 so now i have two chances of winning 
 if i draw my monster or draw the demonic tutor 
 david also had an unusually useful card in his deck as well 
 i think it was some kind of rare card and he <unk> it so much 
 i don’t remember what card it was but i remember it did him no good against me 
 my goal was to completely win the match and then <unk> his precious rare “at <unk> 
 to prepare i took my <unk> demonic tutor card and oh so gently put a tiny fold in the top right corner of the card 
 this way if you put it in a deck you can see it stand out from all the other cards 
 you only see this if you know what to look for 
 when we met for our match we get to browse each <unk> cards so we know what to expect 
 i browsed through his deck and took out his precious rare to admire 
 while david was too busy looking through my cards i put the same tiny fold in his rare card and put it back in his deck 
 i didn’t have time to check if it stood out so i crossed my fingers 
 next we <unk> our cards 
 since i could see where my demonic tutor was i <unk> it carefully so that it was below the 75 % mark in my deck 
 so when he cut my deck there’s a good chance that the demonic tutor would end up near the top 
 if i didn’t end up getting this card i have a second chance of getting the monster instead 
 luckily when he cut my deck he cut it above my demonic <unk> location so i was good to go in that department 
 next i cut his deck but since i could see where his precious rare was located i made sure to cut the deck so that his card was as close to the bottom as possible and wouldn’t show up during the match 
 david was too <unk> to suspect that anyone other than himself might have evil intentions 
 things are going well so far and i’m starting to feel bad for david 
 i’m starting to question whether what i’m doing is the right thing 
 these doubts are quickly erased by subsequent events 
 we start to play 
 my job here at this point was to watch him like a <unk> and call him out every time he tries to cheat 
 and try he did 
 he tried to do the whole multiple <unk> on me 
 i called him out on it 
 david tried to act like it was an accident 
 this got the tournament <unk> attention and david a verbal tongue <unk> from alex 
 alex basically told david to stop acting like an asshole and play the game 
 this had the effect of <unk> destroying <unk> credibility and getting everyone in the room on my side 
 i shined a <unk> on his douchey ways so to speak 
 next thing he did was try to lawyer his way to do something that was clearly against the rules 
 of course i made a calm but loud enough scene for everyone to notice and eventually called alex over again to adjudicate 
 alex told him he’s full of shit and ruled in my favor 
 soon enough i had the demonic tutor in my hand after several turns since it was near the top 
 by this time i had all that i needed but the monster 
 i pretended to act <unk> and surprised when i threw down my demonic tutor and went <unk> through my deck to get that monster 
 <unk> face started to go red and his body was very agitated 
 the next round i threw that monster on the table with <unk> 
 i celebrated with <unk> ” and “i can’t believe it ” 
 the other people in the room were starting to admire my skill and good luck 
 they were really watching my game now and clearly wanting to see me win 
 the best david can do at this point is pull out a monster to block me or somehow get rid of my monster 
 knowing that the only card that has a hope of achieving that is his precious rare safely at the bottom of his deck i was <unk> confident but acted nervous to lead him on that he actually had a chance of pulling one out 
 every subsequent round i would attack him with the monster <unk> his life down 
 of course during this time nothing good came out of his deck 
 slowly his chances for winning <unk> and his fury grew 
 then it was over 
 i celebrated and other people in the room <unk> at my amazing play style 
 david was so mad he was shaking 
 whenever he spoke he was petulant and angry 
 while i was making a big show of celebrating my good fortune david had already planned and executed his next cheat 
 he took both his active pile and his reject pile and mixed them together as soon as the game ended 
 if you recall these piles are supposed to be separate so that i could choose which pile to <unk> from 
 by mixing them up he reduces the chance that i’ll randomly take any of his good cards including his precious rare 
 i immediately called him out on it as he’s mixing them together 
 he starts arguing about the tournament rules and his <unk> of them 
 i make a big show of arguing and acting like i was cheated 
 honestly it didn’t matter that he did this since i could still see where his precious rare was 
 this final act of cheating showed his <unk> and completely ruined any reputation he had in the room 
 i called over alex the organizer to adjudicate and demand restitution 
 clearly there was no way to <unk> the decks unless you have an <unk> <unk> device so the damage was done 
 alex called david an asshole for what he did and alex tried to <unk> my hurt feelings 
 acting hurt and angry i told him “fine 
 let’s get this over <unk> david had a smirk under his face thinking he’d finally pulled one over on me 
 oh how wrong he was 
 while making a show of concentration and <unk> i spread his deck out and made a show of going after a card but changing my mind a couple times 
 finally “at <unk> i pulled out the card with the tiny folded corner and with drama turned it around to show everyone at the same time that it was the precious rare 
 immediately david let out a scream of anger that made the whole room silent 
 he quickly packed up all his crap and stomped out of the room 
 but i had his precious rare 
 everyone was overjoyed that i had completely and totally <unk> david and dealt a slice of <unk> karmic justice at the same time 
 we all agreed how much of an asshole he was and that he got what he deserved 
 honestly it was the highlight of the tournament 
 david dropped out of the tournament after that and no one was sad to see him go 
 i never told anyone about my deception 
 i think people are happier thinking the universe conspired against david to deliver justice 
 tl dr i <unk> the cheater by knowing the <unk> revenge story was posted in <unk> 15 years ago 
 once upon a time there was a man who owned a piece of land next to a thriving restaurant 
 now this man had owned the land for a long time 22 years and it was <unk> 
 he had bought it cheaply but it had great highway <unk> and he had always dreamed of building a little used cars lot or gun shop on the tract as his retirement pastime 
 now the man had had the tract zoned as a commercial lot when he bought it but when news leaked about the upcoming development the restaurant owners <unk> the zoning board to overturn the commercial zoning and <unk> the original agricultural zoning 
 by the way all land in the <unk> state of kentucky is zoned as agricultural by default 
 this was unfair illegal and generally rude but the restaurateur 's brother was the county zoning commissioner so things naturally turned against our would-be entrepreneur 
 after fighting the good clean <unk> sort of battle and losing our would-be entrepreneur gave up 
 he decided to accept the county zoning 
 not to see the tract go idly unused the <unk> <unk> decided to pursue another business <unk> 
 he raised hogs 
 lots of them 
 two hundred and four to be exact on his little 12 <unk> tract 
 for those of you unfamiliar with the <unk> in <unk> kentucky the summers are downright <unk> in their <unk> and heat 
 as you can imagine a rather <unk> odor grew up around the thriving hog farm 
 patrons of the restaurant ate elsewhere anywhere else to be exact 
 in a matter of weeks the zoning commissioner <unk> his earlier ruling returning the commercial status of the lot 
 it is another <unk> of kentucky zoning law that land can always be used for a purpose lesser on the scale of <unk> than its current zoning 
 everyone especially the restaurateur was surprised when the hog farm remained in operation 
 nothing not even substantial financial offers could convince the new farmer to quit his now beloved <unk> 
 exactly 3 months and four days after the opening of the hog farm the restaurant closed its doors for good 
 the farmer in a fit of depression ceased hog farming and decided to open a small sporting goods store instead 
 it remains there to this day alongside his <unk> restaurant 
 never spoke much about this revenge but here it goes 
 i came home from a double shift at work only to find someone had shot my two english <unk> 
 everyone in my neighborhood knew it was my one neighbor but no one could prove it 
 he would make comments <unk> to it but never outright said he did it 
 fast forward three years later everyone in the neighborhood hates this guy still 
 he is just a monster 
 i had a horse that foaled sooner than i thought she would was told she was due in dec she foaled in <unk> 
 after checking her <unk> to make sure it was all there she gave birth while i was at work i was at a loss of what to do with the <unk> 
 a few days later i see asshole neighbor put up a beautiful brand new white front door 
 i knew what i was going to do 
 middle of the night i used 2 ice <unk> carried this massively heavy <unk> to the front of his house ... .and <unk> that bitch right on his door 
 all i could see was a dark <unk> at the upper half of the door all the way down 
 he had a new door put up the next day 
 this happened during my final year of school which in comparison would be the final year of high school '' i was in a boarding school due to a problematic family situation 
 my roommate this year was the fattest meanest person i have ever met in my life and she continually made my life a living hell 
 my problems with her was that she continually stole my stuff especially my food and snacks 
 when i locked my stuff in my locker she threw fits like an angry toddler 
 another thing i really hated about her was that she would always eat <unk> at night often noisy stuff like <unk> or crackers and the following morning the package wrappers would be all over the floor 
 i would always step on <unk> it was fucking nasty 
 the staff did nothing about it as they had no proof of her actions 
 finally i had enough of her and when the staff did n't want to do anything about the situation i decided to do so myself 
 one morning as i was leaving for school i opened the window just the <unk> bit 
 when the students left for school a teacher was supposed to make sure none of the rooms had any windows open but when opening the window just right it would appear to be close while actually being open 
 during lunch i ran back to my room and went in through the window 
 this way the staff in the house would n't see me 
 the lockers in the room had number locks with only three numbers i tried out the different <unk> until i eventually found the right one 
 i hid every food and snack item in my roommates locker underneath her bed 
 when i locked up the closet again i put some metal in the locker slot a trick i had been taught by one of the other students 
 basically you just have to pull a bit harder to get your lock up but to an idiot it appears as if your lock is stuck 
 i then went back to school and no one even suspected i had been gone 
 in the evening the day continued as normal 
 at 5pm all students had to be in their room and do homework 
 i entered my room to the sight of my roommate fighting her locker and <unk> complain about how it was n't working 
 she could n't get the lock to open at all 
 finally she blew a fuse and started kicking and trashing at the door which made all of the staff turn up in our doorway 
 she complained about her locker specifically her lock but one of the staff members <unk> to get it open pretty quickly 
 when her locker did n't hold any of her precious food she blew yet another fuse and started crying about people stealing her stuff 
 one of the staff members asked her whatever she was sure she did n't just misplace it and she spit all over his face as she explained to him in great detail that she would never misplace her stuff 
 the staff started searching the room and pretty much immediately found the stuff hidden underneath her bed 
 they are of course mad as hell about the fact she <unk> '' her stuff and then <unk> her locker in a fit of rage 
 the episode made way fro me to complain about how i felt unsafe having to be in a room with my roommate obviously she had anger issues 
 i was assigned a new roommate 
 mission complete 
 my wife was extremely ill throughout her entire pregnancy with my daughter 
 she missed enough work to eventually be let go 
 she was due in december and terminated early in the month on the day we had our daughter 
 with a mortgage bills and now two kids this was a very difficult time for us 
 i was working as a professional office type but also picked up a paper route for extra cash 
 i was getting up every morning at 3 am 
 running the route then going to work all day for 8-10 hours 
 i needed a day off from the route and you have to find your own coverage 
 i took to craigslist i know 
 kid like 19 i think agrees to meet me 
 we drive the route i give him the instructions directions and pay him $ 20 up front 
 we agree i 'll pay the rest when it 's done 
 he shares with me he 's getting a new job a place i worked before in an administrative capacity and i still have lots of connections there 
 he no shows 
 i get myself in there and get it done 
 call him 1000 times 
 no answer 
 well i have his name 
 call my friends at the new job and explain what an ass he is 
 guess what 
 he 's fired before he even hits training 
 i find out a year later he was arrested for raping an <unk> girl 
 lots of luck in life <unk> guys another short story for you all 
 **the setting : ** after finishing basic units in community college i had transferred to a <unk> <unk> family had fallen on hard times so i had taken up a part-time job to <unk> my financial aid 
 the job was at a cell-phone kiosk located inside of a virtually empty <unk> 
 it was minimum wage but it was all i could get at the time 
 **the target : ** $ douchebagdan a regional manager of the kiosk company 
 this retard considered himself to be the next steve jobs yet had absolutely zero practical experience in sales or marketing 
 he was n't directly abusive however he made a point of promoting the two <unk> people in the company and assigning them to make everybody else 's life a living hell 
 **the reason : ** i could spend hours writing about my time at the kiosk but ill spare you the boring stuff 
 let 's just say that it got to the point where i carried a <unk> and installed a <unk> app on my <unk> 
 even the <unk> manager had submitted formal complaints about the <unk> and actions of my immediate superiors 
 **the last <unk> i took a much needed 5-day vacation to go home and visit family 
 i sat in traffic 4 members of my immediate family cramped in my small car 
 my phone rings and i answer with my bluetooth speaker 
 & gt viper : hello 
 & gt $ manager : what the <unk> 
 a few minutes went by with my manager berating me for taking a 5-day vacation even though he had approved it 
 i finally hung up on him 
 my family was mortified 
 for the first time in my entire life i saw my grandmother without a smile on her face 
 i dialed $ douchebagdan 
 & gt $ douchebagdan : hello 
 & gt viper : hi $ douchebagdan i need to report abuse from my manager again 
 & gt $ d : why 
 & gt viper : he just called me and berated me for taking a vacation that he had approved 
 & gt $ douchebagdan : where did you go 
 & gt viper : i dont see how that matters 
 & gt $ douchebagdan : it does tell me 
 & gt viper : i went home to visit my family 
 & gt $ douchebagdan : for how long 
 & gt viper : 5 days & gt $ douchebagdan : you what 
 & gt viper : he approved it a month ago 
 & gt $ douchebagdan : you need to return to the store now 
 & gt viper : i 'm like 400 miles away 
 & gt $ douchebagdan : i do n't give a <unk> 
 you ca n't take 5 day vacations 
 the conversation continued to this effect 
 i could almost see the steam coming out of my grandmother 's ears 
 finally i ended the call 
 i was done dealing with it 
 i drove back to my parents house and pulled out my laptop 
 i packaged up all of the recordings into a <unk> file and called up the company hr 
 i filed my report and sent off the recordings 
 the following monday i woke up to my alarm at 8am 
 i had n't heard back from hr yet so i called them and asked for an update 
 it 's under investigation '' was the answer 
 i told the hr rep that i was n't comfortable going to work 
 i gave them my formal resignation without notice and hung up 
 a few hours later i got a call from hr again 
 they told me they were putting me on paid leave '' and would be in contact soon 
 another week passed and i was invited to lunch with the hr manager 
 **the resolution : ** $ douchebagdan was fired on the spot 
 the management under him were heavily audited and 3 of the 4 were also fired 
 the audit revealed that one of the managers was <unk> fraud by creating fake accounts then selling the sold '' phones on craigslist 
 further investigation revealed that $ douchebagdan was also in on the deal <unk> the numbers wherever he could 
 both were convicted 
 $ manager was found to have a permanent record of physical violence one that $ douchebagdan had hidden from the hr team he fell back on drugs and eventually skipped town 
 i got my job back and was given the title of manager '' for the few short months that i stayed with the company 
 **the revenge : ** about a year after the incident i was on linkedin and saw a people you may know '' recommendation 
 it was $ douchebagdan 
 i checked his profile and was surprised to find that he had found a job as a regional manager for a fairly sizable electronics retailer 
 that was at least until somebody sent an anonymous tip '' to his new employer 
 suddenly he did n't seem to be employed there anymore 
 original link to my story here : so it 's been 3 months now 
 found out through email notification she was released back on parole but in the same state she committed the original crime in 
 <unk> i thought my small work of revenge got her 6 months 
 job well done 
 well about a month after her release i received another email notifying me of her fugitive status 
 she ran again 
 well there 's only one way for her to make money so i searched some sex ads in the area 
 and <unk> know 
 there she is again 
 knowing her addiction to social media a few clicks of the mouse and bam ... guess what i found 
 within 3 weeks of getting out of prison she ran back to her home state and married some guy she was seeing for a couple months before i turned her in 
 seriously 
 she accomplished what she tried to do to me so <unk> 
 no doubt she did it to change her last name and to have a base of operations with a man that will put a roof over her head no questions asked 
 from what i can tell this guy has been single a long time and suddenly this <unk> that 's madly in love with him wants to get married 
 no red flags there of course ... well from his profile he had to go on a work trip or something and within 4 days ... <unk> days after getting married she was posting ads all over the state and traveling to meet clients 
 not going to sit by and watch this dude get <unk> and her to get through life <unk> through deception and lying ... .so i contacted him told the full story turns out he did n't even know her real last name 
 i suggested he turn her in but instead he just confronted her 
 she played the victim up until she bailed and ran out the door 
 he thanked me after that event 
 hopefully this is grounds for an <unk> 
 not so much pro revenge i 'll agree with that 
 maybe slightly <unk> on my part ... maybe 
 but it 's not hard these days with the wealth of information people put online for a simple google search to <unk> what somebody is doing with their life especially if they do n't try to hide it 
 leave the poor girl alone 
 fuck no she 's a sociopath and a fugitive and will continue to con men until she lands a <unk> 
 honestly people like her are almost worse than sex offenders at least they get put on a list 
 granted is it their own fault guys like him get taken advantage of 
 hell no until you meet a sociopath you have no idea of what <unk> they are capable of especially when it 's a women that uses her sexual nature 
 people like her continue to roam free wrecking peoples hearts wasting their time and taking their money 
 if i could i 'd make this bitch famous 
 edit : well here we are 4 months later ... looks she deleted all her personal information off the web and used <unk> phones for a bit while she continued to escort for a month or so after her husband was notified 
 decided to check up on the situation today 
 turns out 1 month ago she has made a <unk> online and the husband has taken her back 
 looks like he involved her family somehow because now everyone is friends on facebook he did n't even know her parents when they married 
 i guess this is where the story ends 
 crazy sociopath gets away with screwing men over for years into false relationships has a couple kids <unk> them to their fathers then <unk> a guy that took her back after she decided to go hooking for a few months during their marriage still a fugitive too 
 whatever story she concocted to convince him to keep her well good for them 
 just goes to show in this world a pretty girl can do no wrong 
 there will always be nice guys to pick them up when they <unk> was on a business trip to a client in <unk> located just far enough away from the city to be a very expensive cab ride but not so far as to warrant a rental car 
 i flew down got an airport cab there was there for a week being picked up and delivered from my hotel by <unk> and on friday the client called a cab for me to return to the airport 
 the driver of my cab was distracted and not driving with safe attention to the road so after a couple miles he hit another car 
 fortunately it was a <unk> collision just barely not fast enough to <unk> air bags and everyone walked away <unk> 
 however i had to wait for the cops to show up to give a statement and i insisted the cab company send another car with another driver to take me to the airport 
 a couple minutes into waiting i realized the driver had left the meter running which i insisted he stop 
 all told i was there maybe an hour between waiting for the cop talking to the cop convincing the cop not to force me to go to the hospital i had a black eye before the accident and the cop was really worried that i was terribly injured and too delusional to realize i had been hurt and waiting for a new cab to show up 
 so while i 'd left early for my flight by the time i got to the airport i was going to have to rush to make it 
 you 'd think if you had a cab company and your driver had a car accident with a passenger in the car you 'd see to it that they got to their destination safely and hope they do n't sue you but not only did the second cabbie run the meter and ask me to pay but he told me the owner of the cab company had insisted he get the fare from the first cab 's meter and insist i pay it too 
 he had the <unk> to look ashamed about all this so i was n't too nasty to him personally i told him calmly that i recognized that the law allowed that i could be charged for the trip although good business practice would <unk> otherwise but that if i had n't been charged i would have given him a good tip while now he 'd get no tip as i was offended 
 and then i told him what to tell his boss i was going to do ... you see my client there was a major bank ... it was n't bank of america but a few years later it got bought by bank of america so you can think of it as being that size 
 and they had people in to consult with them and work with them often and they always used this cab company for all the local travel 
 i would be going back there in two weeks so i simply phoned up my client on monday morning to let them know about the accident and asked them very nicely to please find another cab company for me to use when i would be there 
 my contact at the client was of course horrified and made sure that they their employees and their consultants and contractors would never be using that cab company <unk> not my story my dad 's 
 the year is <unk> my dad goes to a well known college with a large student body 
 as such the dorms are all ten stories high 
 on floor nine of one such building lives a certain asshole 
 we 'll call him douchebag or db for short 
 db lives in the same dorm as my dad and has a window directly over the entrance to the dorm 
 being the asshole that he is db keeps a bucket of water balloons 
 and every day when students got out of class db would throw water balloons at the people entering the dorm below him 
 this did not sit well for a lot of people but db generally did n't target people who he thought could beat him up 
 however 9 stories up it 's easy to get away with a lot of things 
 he 'd get individuals walking alone or groups of small girls people carrying books etc 
 one day my dad just happened to be one of those people 
 db drops a water balloon missing him but still landing on the <unk> and splattering all over him 
 dad looks up sees db laugh and close the window 
 <unk> this asshole 's gon na get it 
 what db does n't know is that my dad was a huge prankster in high school 
 there are plenty of things i 'd love to tell this subreddit but a lot of them would n't count as revenge '' 
 so dad gets his friends together and they formulate a plan 
 see one of his friends knows the kid who lives in a dorm on floor 10. directly above db 
 late in the night they haul a huge garbage can up the <unk> all ten flights fill it to the brim with water and set it in the friend 's room 
 the next afternoon class lets out and they sprint back to the dorms and lie in wait 
 sure enough db leans out of his window ready to strike 
 and that 's when the water hits him 
 <unk> gallons of pure glory rained down from above with enough force to almost drag him out the window 
 and it just kept coming 
 call it what you want 
 a <unk> of karma 
 a shower of revenge 
 a <unk> of stupid 
 needless to say the water balloons stopped after that 
 edited because they filled it after they brought it up 10 <unk> happened last spring 
 it was for a final project in my sophomore year of high school 
 i joined a group for a total of four including two good friends 
 however we all just assumed someone knew the last guy none of us knew quite how this indian kid named dan got into our group 
 whatever dan was a smart guy from what we knew 
 we planned a study session at <unk> bread the following saturday 
 group text 
 everyone confirms they will attend 
 even dan 
 of course dan does n't show up 
 no biggie right 
 we bust our asses on the script and decide to let him get away with just writing the analysis of our script 
 dan once again agrees 
 the next week we were going to film the project at my house 
 now it is important to note here that due to poor planning on our part we had only two more days until the final was due and we had n't even filmed yet 
 we <unk> dan to bring the analysis of the script with him to my house when we film 
 but guess what : he has n't done the analysis like we told him to 
 he tells us he can write it while we film but that was n't the deal we need everyone in our group to film for full credit 
 so dan says he will come film with us than write the analysis 
 but does n't show up 
 what the fuck dan 
 we missed off season practice to accommodate <unk> and you do n't show up 
 at this point we realize he is just dead weight 
 but we were mad 
 we wanted revenge 
 we realized we had been instructed to pick our own groups 
 technically *the teacher had no idea who was paired with <unk> 
 so we compiled all of our group texts including some where this guy referred to us white guys using the n-word and printed them off 
 then we shot the film sans dan and i gleefully wrote the analysis solo 
 the next day the day before its due dan is texting us like mad trying to get us to film with him 
 but oops 
 sorry dan we only took one day off practice to meet with you and that was yesterday 
 we finish practice 
 i tell dan who had already been waiting 3 hours at this point that we had already shot the day before 
 he sends a flurry of angry texts demanding that we shoot the entire project over again to which we all reply no 
 come the day of the project we had already emailed the analysis video and script to the teacher 
 we show her screenshots where dan has clearly neglected his responsibilities and <unk> to us with the n-word 
 dan is called to speak with her privately right before we present and is not in the class for the rest of the period 
 we later found out he had received a warning for his use of language with us but even better dan received an f on his project and his grade dropped two letters 
 it was glorious and nobody ever worked with him on a project for the rest of the year in any class 
 he did learn his lesson but not before getting the lowest passing grade in the class that year 
 edit : unnecessary <unk> all 
 this is gon na be a long one just warning you now 
 this happened about a year ago now in <unk> of 2014 i had just split with my ex-wife and was moving into my own place with a friend of mine we 'll call him ... <unk> or db for short db had just split up with his girlfriend of almost 15 years we decided to move in together as we were good friends and had known each other a couple years 
 upon moving day i moved all my things into my room aside from my desktop which i put downstairs and setup attached to my desk with locks 
 my laptop which was worth quite a bit was stored in a storage <unk> in my closet that he did n't know about as i chose that room specifically for this purpose 
 things were going well for the first week ... .then my <unk> disappears ended up finding it at his <unk> place as he had taken it over for his kids without asking me i <unk> it and took it back told him if they wanted to play it they can come over to our place same with my <unk> 
 a few days after that i find him snorting coke and pills and lock up my stuff even harder not wanting him to sell it off but low and behold he somehow finds my laptop and <unk> it for cash i called the cops they said there was no proof so i went pawn shop hunting and found it but they would n't let me see it as it had already been sold even though i argued tooth and nail it was stolen property and i would sue unless they let me try to access it as the hard drive was busted and i knew that within that short time span they could n't have replaced it ended up not getting the laptop back as they had a signed paper with a false name on it and gave him $ <unk> cash for it 
 man i was fucking livid at that point 
 onto the next part i confronted him about it told him to get my laptop back or get the fuck out of my apartment cause i was the only one paying for bills and food he called my bluff and did n't leave 
 so i packed up my stuff called the cops on him snorting drugs and gave them full access to enter the home and left 
 last i heard he 's living under a bridge after posting bail somehow for all the drugs they found and his kids do n't even want to see him nice knowing you dickbag hope you have fun living on scraps the rest of your life 
 tl dr guy stole my expensive gaming laptop he got caught i called the cops and moved out he got evicted cause he could n't pay and the landlord took his stuff after 30 days as is the agreement when he did n't move out edit : forgot to mention he took my brand new car out for <unk> when i was working and it 's not hard to spot driving around town as i 'm the only one with one <unk> may not quite be a revenge story as there was no sole perpetrator whom was targeted 
 rather that i simply got tired of being awoken at <unk> 
 either way i could n't find an appropriate sub to put this in so here we are 
 during my college years i lived in a small town that had two main <unk> : the university i attended and a latter day <unk> training <unk> 
 the town 's residents consisted entirely of college frat boys <unk> and lds 
 for the most part it 's a very nice town to live in i would n't <unk> one moment to move back but there were a few small things that bugged me 
 the most notable of these was that my condo was only a block away from the lds church which meant that roughly twice a week my doorbell would go off at about 6am 
 now i am not a racist or <unk> however i am a <unk> - anybody who wakes me up unnecessarily is bound to find that out very quickly 
 sadly this chain continued through my first semester of college 
 being that i was working a full-time job while attending full-time college i had very little time to spare 
 getting more than 4 hours of sleep in a night was my version of sleeping in 
 so you can understand that the <unk> at 6am quickly became an unacceptable <unk> 
 it was time to put a stop to this nonsense 
 at first i posted signs 
 nobody read them 
 i disabled the doorbell 
 they knocked 
 i put up two signs 
 they still ignored them 
 i <unk> satanist <unk> and pasted it up on the windows at the front of the house 
 that only <unk> them more to show us the light '' i parked my car to block the pathway to the house 
 they climbed over the bushes 
 i called and filed complaints with the church 
 my words were ignored 
 finally i 'd had enough 
 i pulled my roommate into a meeting and we plotted 
 we plotted real hard 
 tuesday morning we were prepared and like clockwork only a few minutes after 6am there was a knock on the door 
 i opened the door shirtless 
 i had blood all over me and was carrying a knife and the leg of a boar that my roomate had recently shot on a hunting trip 
 the lds boys were shocked but were determined to talk to us so i invited them in 
 they walked into our living room we had our satanist paraphernalia plastered to the walls and even had a fake human skull hanging from the ceiling fan 
 on the television we were playing a <unk> <unk> with the speakers turned up quite loudly 
 the boy 's sat and i offered them some glasses of vodka 
 they declined 
 i took two shots 
 & gt viper : so what i can i do for you two 
 & gt lds : we are here to talk to you about jesus & gt viper : who 
 & gt lds : our savior jesus 
 & gt viper : i 'm not good at spanish but i think you are <unk> it wrong 
 & gt lds : jesus the son of god 
 & gt viper : oh 
 i see 
 hold on let me get my husband hes fascinated about this kind of thing 
 important note : i am a straight male 
 i stand up and walk down the hall to the bathroom where my roomate is currently hiding 
 & gt viper : dear 
 the boys want to talk to you & gt roomate : right now 
 & gt viper : yeah they want to talk about <unk> & gt roomate : cant i finish 
 & gt viper : i dont want them to be waiting 
 & gt roomate : fine ... the bathroom door opens and my roomate steps out 
 he is completely nude except for shaving cream covering <unk> of his <unk> 
 the effect was that he was <unk> through 
 he steps out into the living room and with a voice that would make richard simmons seem straight says : & gt roomate : oh <unk> the look of shock on the boy 's faces was priceless 
 & gt lds : um we can come back if you guys are ... & gt roomate : nonsense 
 tell me about this <unk> & gt lds : <unk> okay ... roughly an hour went by my nude roomate interrogating the boys as i continued to <unk> a boar on the kitchen table while intently watching the boys make <unk> glances at the skull <unk> and the door 
 finally we let them go and cleaned ourselves up 
 we had to <unk> the floor later to get the <unk> out but it was totally worth it 
 we had 2 whole years of <unk> sleep 
 update : 1. the mod 's contacted me asking me to show some proof and the information that i have provided them seems to have been satisfactory 
 if you think this was made up then you are a minority 
 2. there has been some argument over the timing of the lds boys 
 not all doorbell rings were at 6am on the dot however since our apartment was so close to the church we were always some of the first in line 
 generally speaking the knocks were <unk> between <unk> 
 so let me start this story by saying that i am a <unk> 
 i transit to work via bicycle because generally it seems to be the fastest and cheapest way for me to get to work 
 i have also just moved and have just realized that busses to my new area stop running after <unk> 
 so you know now more than ever it is the most efficient means of travel 
 given that i have n't moved far my route to work has n't changed very much 
 i take a slightly different route but ultimately it all connects to the same road i have taken <unk> times before without issue 
 today i am riding along said road and i come up to a bus stop full of bogan teenagers could n't be older than 13 blocking the shared <unk> path 
 i 'm not an ass so i slow down and gradually make my way through them 
 while i 'm doing this one of the teens who was spraying deoderant on himself decides hes going to be funny and spray deoderant in my face 
 i stop 
 i get off my bike and walk towards him asking him what the fuck he thinks hes doing 
 he thinks i 'm going to hit him and i do n't blame him for thinking that and takes off 
 <unk> around the corner 
 since i have left for work early i figure i have enough time to confront this kid a little bit more and get on my bicycle and chase after him 
 i could n't see him anywhere 
 this old couple was walking along and i ask them did you see a little turd run by here 
 they respond that he went in the alley way 
 so i pursue him he sees me and begins running again 
 at this point while i 'm <unk> after him i want him to realize that i 'm not just your run of the mill <unk> that he has messed with a crazy woman 
 so i start yelling at him the craziest stuff i can think of at the time 
 *keep running <unk> *i 'm gon na get you 
 * *i 'm going to make you my bitch 
 * over and over with a couple of fucking '' <unk> here and there 
 i chase him around the block a few times past the old couple past a man in a suit who saw the whole thing 
 his friends are laughing at him the guy in the suit is laughing at him the old couple just seems confused 
 eventually he is puffed out even though he can dodge me easily since he is on foot i have more energy than him again i cycle to work every day 
 he 's puffed out and says him : maam him : maam i 'm sorry 
 him : all i did was spray deoderant on you me : you know that is called assault mate 
 me : you sprayed it in my <unk> face for some reason i said fucking this way me : if it was anyone else you might be lucky to be standing him : well i 'm sorry can we hug can we shake hands 
 me : i do n't really want to mate 
 at this point i <unk> as to what exactly i am going to do 
 should i accept and let him go 
 or should i humiliate him more in front of his friends who are now watching our exchange 
 i was a teen once i know what teens respond to better 
 so i took his hat 
 i cycled around the corner out of sight to where this originally happened and put it in the bin next to the bus stop 
 i ride past the man who has taken his suit jacket off since it is damn hot and he asks me : <unk> you get <unk> 
 i respond *i got his <unk> i ride off into the ... sunrise 
 get to work and have a shower 
 moral of the story is do n't fuck with <unk> on a shared pathway 
 we are n't cars we are n't in heavy traffic that will keep us moving away from you we can stop and we can turn around 
 backstory : my baseball team in high school was a co-op with another local high school so every day the baseball guys from our school would get on a bus after school and ride to the co-op school for practice 
 to combat my <unk> at practice every day before school i would fill my gatorade squirt bottle with <unk> gatorade mix 
 then shortly before getting on the bus for practice after school i would fill my bottle from the water fountain to have cold gatorade for practice 
 for a few days on the bus during my senior year we would get to the co-op school and all of my gatorade would be gone from the bottle 
 you see some of my friends and i would be sitting in the seats facing the aisles so we could talk so my back was to my bag and my other stuff and i would n't be paying attention to it 
 one of the guys would sneak under the seats to where i was sitting take my bottle sneak back to his seat drink it all with one of his friends sneak back to my seat and put the bottle back without me noticing 
 i acknowledge this was partially my fault for not paying attention to my stuff but at the same time i was from a small school and knew all the guys on the team and therefore did n't think i should have to worry about my teammates stealing my drink every day 
 after the third day of it happening or so i decided that was the final straw 
 we boarded the bus the next day and all was normal ... or so they thought 
 i placed my stuff in the seat and intentionally faced the aisle of the bus waiting in giggly and <unk> <unk> for the bait to be taken 
 about 10 minutes into the drive i took a chance and sneaked a peek behind into my seat ... and my bottle was gone 
 shortly after i heard from the front of the bus what what 's wrong man '' 
 i looked up to see one of my teammates john look over his seat and angrily look at me with my bottle in his hand 
 **what did you put in here 
 ** '' unable to resist any longer i busted out laughing and revealed to the entire bus full of my teammates as loudly as i could : <unk> just drank my piss 
 <unk> '' prior to the bus ride that day i did n't put gatorade mix in the bottle and instead took a pee into the bottle before boarding the bus 
 after i peed into my own water bottle i filled the rest of it with water from the fountain to 1. mask the warmth of my pee and 2. fill the remainder of the bottle as to not make the perpetrator suspicious 
 shortly after discovering that he had just drank my kidney <unk> john momentarily freaked out ran back to my seat and started punching my shoulder while i rolled with <unk> laughter 
 to this day i have never had any sweeter revenge on anyone in my entire life 
 tl dr john stole my gatorade so i made him some of my special <unk> my street is kind of a main <unk> for students from the local high school 
 it more or less takes them directly from campus to most of the fast food restaurants 
 because of this there is always tons of litter and kids doing stupid shit 
 more times than i can count i 've looked out the window to find <unk> bags or drinks or sometimes entire pizza boxes thrown into someone 's driveway 
 so shortly after school starts for the season i 'm already sick of this shit 
 next time someone <unk> i 'm gon na rub their god damn nose in it 
 not helping my mood is the fact that not even half a block away there is a garbage can 
 the shaming part 1 it 's laundry day 
 i 'm in shorts and bare feet nothing else i 'm a <unk> dude tho 
 this wild herd of students all bearing items of litter walks in front of the house and i 'm watching them discretely out the window 
 i 'm thinking okay maybe one of them will drop a cup and i 'll tell him to pick it up 
 even better 
 i get the holy grail 
 some fat kid whips a full drink right at the garage door and runs quite sadly a few feet down the block 
 i 've got him in my sights i rip the door open and tear after him 
 i call out hey fatass are you kidding me '' and all of his friends turn around but he pretends not to hear 
 his friends just stand there white as sheets as i grab the <unk> by his collar and toss him to the ground 
 i yell you wan na throw shit at my house '' 
 and he starts <unk> out i 'm sorry i 'm sorry someone paid me to do it '' with this terrified look on his face 
 this kid is a minor and i could probably already get in shit 
 i let it slide tell him to <unk> the fuck up and go back in 
 they all continued on without a word 
 the shaming part 2 fast forward about a week so today 
 our pumpkins are still on the steps from halloween 
 not even near the sidewalk mind you but all the way up in front of the door 
 the usual lunch rush comes and i 'm reading a book on the couch in my shorts laundry day again 
 my girlfriend hears this scream from outside and i slowly walk over and watch these two teenage girls kicking our smashed pumpkins down the street about a house over 
 now i do n't know if they did it or if they 're just kicking the pieces but my girlfriend says i thought i saw someone 's head in front of the window '' and she goes out there and watches them 
 as she steps out this construction guy in his dump truck pulls up and says it was the girl in the pink sweater 
 i think her name is ashley '' 
 fuck yeah construction guy 
 so we jump in the car and pull out of the driveway 
 it should be noted that at this point this rude douche <unk> student with an ugly mustache just guns it around me in a <unk> 
 remember this guy 
 so we catch up to the girls pull into a driveway and my girlfriend who is pregnant btw fucking <unk> them right out 
 asks them why the fuck they felt like doing that told them how hard we worked on them etc 
 they apologize look like they 're on the <unk> of tears and shaking 
 could n't be older than 15. gf asks what we should do i say they seem sorry i think we should just let them go '' 
 but that 's not good enough for my girl 
 she tells them if you do n't clean it up i 'm coming with you to the school and we 're gon na tell your parents '' 
 they definitely do n't want that and she <unk> them all the way back to our place 
 ten minutes later they 're covered in pumpkin and the mess is clean 
 construction guy is still there and he gives me the nod '' 
 then guess who shows up 
 mustache douche in his dirty ass car 
 asks them if they want a ride and they start getting in 
 they mention how dirty they are and my girlfriend being the considerate person she is asks if they want some napkins to clean up 
 at this point we are being way nicer than we should but whatever 
 they decline and tear off down the street 
 now i 'm standing there with my girl and i 'm like this is when he rolls down the window and screams something '' 
 well he rolled down the window but he flipped the bird instead 
 you just had to fucking do it did n't you 
 we were gon na let this go 
 not anymore 
 so i start sprinting my ass down the street not shirtless this time i have a jacket and shoes on 
 i lose him after a couple blocks but by the time i get to the corner he 's actually dropped the girls off and he 's coming back 
 yes 
 my girl is in the car she caught up to me 
 i see mustache across the street slowing to a stop sign and i run over there yelling <unk> <unk> '' 
 his face goes pale and he just guns it through the stop sign 
 girlfriend turns i jump in and we fly after him 
 he stops further ahead and motions us forward so i get out and walk towards him 
 he fucking starts driving off again 
 what is with this coward 
 wo n't talk to me unless i 'm in a car 
 is this what our culture has come to 
 ca n't face me unless you 're in your bubble 
 some time around here he makes like he 's going to swerve right into my girl and smash the car 
 fuck that pissed me off 
 i run at him and he 's just saying you 're a goof fuck you '' etc and i just told him to be a man and step out of the car 
 which he did n't do obviously 
 so he tears off again circles around comes back and sees us and then turns down a side street 
 so we follow him and end up back at the school 
 immediately he runs out and calls over a teacher crying about how i 'm harassing '' him 
 so i politely tell the teacher how him and his friends vandalized my property made obscene <unk> and threatened my pregnant girlfriend with <unk> assault 
 best part is we caught a lot of this on camera thanks to my dear girl 
 so she goes in and shows it to the principal who requests we email him all of the evidence we have 
 so we did went home laughed it off and finished the laundry 
 and we have an embarrassing video of them cleaning up pumpkin and being cowards 
 update : as i was writing this mustache douche actually came back to the house with some people in the car and scoped the house out pointing and talking 
 he circled the block and came back again 
 we have informed the authorities but i 'll keep you guys updated 
 edit for clarification : i 'm gon na address some complaints people have : i did not drag my girlfriend along for the ride 
 i actually ran after the mustache kid on foot leaving her at home 
 it was entirely her own <unk> to catch up in the car 
 she is not my slave i am not her master she has her own free will and can think for herself thank you 
 as for the car chase '' it really was n't 
 he ran a stop sign before i got into the car 
 we drove about 20-30 km/h very casually down the street after him to the next stop sign 
 i got out again he did that <unk> shit at our stopped car and took off 
 i turned around and sat in a driveway 
 we saw him come back and very slowly drove after him around the block and to the school 
 the whole trip was probably about three blocks going half the speed limit 
 so aside from his actions with the stop sign and the <unk> there was no danger 
 also these kids '' as i say are at least 16 years old possibly older <unk> 
 i am <unk> there is not that much of a difference between us 
 when you are 16 and commit a crime you can be charged as an adult 
 therefore i do not consider them minors 
 furthermore i did not actually <unk> or hurt anyone 
 yes i tossed the fat kid 
 he made a violent action towards my home so i did something about it 
 i would n't go further than a shove 
 i could have punched him <unk> him out stomped him 
 but i did n't because i did n't want to 
 i dunno about you guys but in my town when someone flips the bird it 's a sort of challenge 
 i called him out i chased him down 
 i was willing to engage in some good ol <unk> if that 's what he wanted 
 but he very clearly did n't want that and i would n't have done anything to him unless he threw the first punch 
 i was honestly just thinking about kicking the mirror off his car eye for an eye so to speak 
 until he made like he was gon na hit my girl 
 that deserves at least a bit of justice do n't you think 
 update 2 : nothing yet guys 
 he 's been around the block a couple of times but i think he got the hint 
 i 'll post a <unk> if anything happens 
 still waiting to hear back from the principal of the highschool too 
 -- -- -- - tl dr fat kid throws litter gets thrown in return like the trash he is girls smash our pumpkins and have to clean it up on camera then their friends flip the bird try to smash our vehicle pull bitch and cry to the school and get reported to the <unk> everyone this is my first post on this sub 
 i was n't sure whether to put it in pettyrevenge or here since the effort was pretty petty but the results were pro 
 this story takes place on my families farm 
 it 's a small hobby farm we bought about 10 years ago and has two lots cut off the front corners which were sold to two older couples before we bought it 
 they were both very nice and there was lots of space and privacy so life was good 
 on the farm we have four dogs but the two who will be the stars of this story are two <unk> 's whose job it is to protect the farm and the animals from a very large pack of coyotes who roam the area 
 they do this by going to the edges of the property and making a lot of noise to discourage the pack from even coming towards the farm 
 about a year ago the <unk> shit hit the fan 
 one of the couples moved into a retirement home and left the house to their son and his wife unfortunately these two were the classic definition of city <unk> 
 they jumped at every <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and we 're especially upset when they learnt it was a 20 minute drive to the grocery store 
 they also brought a very small chihuahua and a very fat cat with them 
 a couple of nights after the couple had moved in we got a phone call complaining about the dogs that they were barking at the couple and threatening their cat 
 this was strange behavior for the dogs so we apologized and brought them to meet the couple so the dogs would recognize them as friends 
 while we were there we found out that they had been letting their cat roam outside at night we told them that was a bad idea and probably bringing the coyotes in closer and forcing our dogs to come deal with the threat 
 a few hours later we went home thinking everything had been taken care of 
 we were wrong 
 we continued to get phone calls complaining about the dogs on a daily basis and since you can only repeat yourself so many times we eventually gave up on trying to reason with them and started locking the dogs inside through the day as well as ignoring their phone calls 
 since we were n't responding anymore they called animal control who having met our dogs on numerous occasions told them they were being ridiculous 
 after about a month of daily calls to us and animal control we got a call saying that they had bought a gun and if our dogs came near their property again they would shoot them 
 this was not something we wanted to risk so we immediately went out and installed an <unk> fence around the property closest to the house and <unk> that absolutely had to be protected this left almost a <unk> of land between the dogs and the couple and made sure they would not be protected harassed by the dogs any more 
 about a week later we found out that their cat had been killed and eaten by coyotes almost immediately after the fence had gone up and a month after that they sold the house and moved 
 i was more than happy to see them go but i do feel sorry for the cat 
 edit : tl dr dogs protect farm from coyotes city <unk> move in with fat cat threaten dogs dogs get fenced in cat gets eaten by coyotes neighbors move <unk> story takes us back to september 
 now i 'm a nice guy 
 a very nice guy 
 i tell people my phone is always on and i usually get at least one or two calls a week for emergencies 
 one of my friends proceeded to call me at around midnight for a ride from the bar 
 her friends left without her and she was stranded 
 while i 'm waiting for her in the parking lot i am introduced to microdick mcgee in an unpleasant way 
 i see this guy walk out of the bar wearing a sailor hat and go into his jacked up truck raised cab big ass tires suspension and so forth 
 i name his microdick mcgee due to the fake stereotype of big truck means <unk> and because he 's a complete ass 
 see he gets into his truck and proceeds to back up into my parked vehicle on the drivers side ... and then he starts to drive away 
 what 
 did he not feel when he smoked my car 
 anyways i start to chase after him and take photos of his licence plate and truck so i have his info incase he gets away 
 he sees the flash and pulls over three blocks later 
 i get his info in the form of a business card ... turns out he owns his own construction business 
 we go our own separate ways 
 i call him later on a few days later and he wants me to just go to his friends repair shop ... and he 'll pay for it 
 hell no 
 i 'm going through my insurance i do n't want to get fucked over for these repairs 
 so i fill out the forms and bring my car in ... they take photos my statement and that 's it 
 now we skip forward two months ... i still have n't had the repair done i 'm going to wait until christmas when i can afford to be out of commission for a few days 
 i get a call from my insurance ... turns out he 's denying it ever happened now 
 so i have to go meet up at the insurance agency with him at the same time with our vehicles for them to take more photos and <unk> 
 i get a call the day of the meeting ... turns out he ca n't make it 
 nice of him to cancel an hour before the meeting 
 ass 
 i think he 's doing this to avoid getting caught 
 we re schedule for two weeks later ... he <unk> this one again 
 re schedule for another two weeks ... and he misses it again 
 the insurance agent and i are complaining about this twat and i get some ... nice information 
 turns out he was driving on a suspended licence 
 i can only assume from a dui or too many <unk> and tickets 
 <unk> 
 i 'm going to use this against him 
 so i go to the bar and view the footage at the time he hit me and 15 minutes before he hit me 
 remember the sailor hat 
 yeah 
 that fucked him over 
 he 's a candle in the night at the bar 
 too easy to find 
 i get proof of him backing up into me and a video of him having a drink 
 bam 
 drinking and driving 
 did i mention my state has a zero tolerance policy 
 next i tell the cops to show up to the meeting place ... and to wait 
 so we go to the fourth and final meetup where if he did n't make it they 'd rule in my favor and fine him 
 he shows up ... they rule in my favor the paint is still on his car 
 he does n't even look at me the entire time ... and drives away as quick as we 're done 
 bam 
 pulled over as he drives <unk> gets a $ 800 fine for driving without a licence 
 i also give them the video footage 
 <unk> 
 if you did n't have a dui before you do now 
 and now ... i drove past his business a few days later 
 still driving his truck and without a licence 
 so i call the cops again and laugh on my merry way ... and i 'm going to call the cops everytime i see his vehicle there 
 that 's a fuck of a fine he 's going to get eventually his vehicle will be seized and because he ca n't drive ... he 's not going to be able to go to his clients he owns a construction company he 's the only employee so transportation his entirely dependant on him 
 ca n't drive to clients 
 ca n't make money 
 ca n't pay the multiple fines i 'm giving you ... your business is going to go under 
 do n't drink and drive do n't deny an accident you 're clearly at fault for 
 i do n't know if this belongs here but i 'll give it a go 
 this is a story about my sister 
 throughout her entire education primary and high school people kept telling her that she would never amount to anything that she 'll never make something out of herself 
 teachers students and even some of her friends 
 she was told by a teacher that she would never finish high school and that she would live a hard life 
 because she was told all of this she started to believe it and a result she did what people expected her to do 
 she skipped class she did n't try because she was worried about putting herself out there only to be shot down 
 things changed and she did n't want to be this person anymore 
 she now has more than 6 years experience with a volunteer ambulance service where she is the second highest ranked worker 
 she graduated high school near the top of her class 
 her year 12 artwork was a <unk> for an art <unk> 
 she 's three years into her engineering degree when she 's getting distinction and high distinction marks 
 she has two jobs one an engineering job and the other is a great job that lets her travel for free with an included weekend salary of over $ 500 on average 
 her second job requires media coverage so she 's been in the paper quite regularly for promotion 
 everybody who once told her she was going nowhere in life know has her success printed on their papers 
 she recently ran into the teacher who said she would n't finish high school 
 this teacher was excited to see her she came up to her and was asking about her life 
 my sisters response was who are you 
 and then she walked away 
 the friends that trashed her are no longer in her life 
 she hears about them through facebook and some have tried to contact her but she does n't respond 
 tl dr : my sister was told by a lot of teachers students and friends that she would never get anywhere in life 
 she proved them wrong 
 edit : i realize this post is getting a bit <unk> but many of you asked for an update of the <unk> aftermath is at the bottom i repaired an ipod touch for a girl i met at work 
 i initially offered to repair it for $ 40 plus the part which was $ 25 
 she offered to make it a flat 70 $ 
 later instead of coming by my house she <unk> to have some guy meet me at a local grocery store a couple blocks away 
 when they pull up my friend and i notice she is in the truck but sitting very close to the douchebag driving 
 <unk> cab pickup 
 <unk> i think this was a bit confusing because i know she is married to a deployed marine from our convos at work 
 he hands me the ipod through the driver window and i see that this thing is in bad shape 
 i ca n't tell if it was a long drop or a throw but one corner of it is smashed and the <unk> was slightly bent 
 the <unk> was still functional but the shattering made it practically unusable 
 the next day i spend an hour or so carefully peeling off the screen and broken bits and complete the repair after trying to straighten out the corner as best i can 
 i message her to let her know that its done 
 they arrange a meet again not at my house but at the end of the street 
 i meet them there show them the ipod and explain that since the corner was bent the screen does n't fit as well as it would and it would be a good idea to let it sit under some weight to make sure its pressed flat 
 she said it looked great and handed me some money 
 i assumed the two bills she handed me were a $ 20 and a $ 50 
 it was relatively dark so i waited until i was on my steps to check it 
 sure <unk> its only two $ 20 's & gt & lt .. needless to say i was annoyed and i messaged her instantly 
 a day goes by without a reply 
 so i send another message 
 she asks if $ 40 was ok even after seeing that the part + shipping was 75 % of what she gave me 
 so just to make sure it is her intent to stiff me i ask if she means for me to accept 10 $ for the repair and she says i guess '' 
 so of course i proceed to tell her to find someone else to fix the other devices we discussed 
 she decides to call me an ass at that time 
 her boyfriend takes over the conversation 
 he threatens to stomp my ass and slips up by stating that i am not to <unk> to his lady that way 
 amused i decide to press it and toss a couple <unk> his way 
 he responds <unk> with more threats and i ca n't help but laugh at how tough he is trying to act likely in a <unk> rage meant to both put at ease and <unk> his married girlfriend 
 i continue to mess with him for ten or so messages the last of which are in the 3rd image 
 the messages not included show a convo about how shitty of a job i did and it was n't perfect and he could do <unk> interesting being that he was n't her first choice he <unk> some more bs to which i reply with more bs mainly just to piss him off and the block which i had been anticipating came shortly thereafter 
 as soon as i was blocked i knew they could n't see my posts so i posted all 4 images to fb which of course caused some gasps and laughs 
 the final image being a screenshot of a message sent to her husband <unk> a screenshot of his wife 's boyfriend 's initial threat and slip up 
 i did n't include his reply out of respect and since it is n't exactly relevant 
 i can say that he was shocked by the message and thanked me for the info 
 apparently he knows the guy too 
 although he <unk> her and has no reason to trust me a stranger he was grateful for the info and he would deal with it in his own way 
 i thanked him for his service and said take care 
 tl dr - married woman <unk> repair guy for 30 $ then has bf assume the conversation when repair guy calls her on it 
 repair guy gets his <unk> off causing general drama and proceeds to inform her deployed marine husband of her cheating with screenshot 
 this may be slightly petty but it was n't ideal material for pettyrevenge being that it was n't something lame like flipping the cd in someones <unk> drive or changing a label on something etc etc 
 update : i have not been in contact with any of the parties involved since the incident occurred but i do have news regarding the aftermath 
 i was browsing one of the local <unk> groups on fb and to my <unk> is the chick that screwed me outta $ 30 trying to sell some shit haha 
 i knew immediately that she had created a new account because i was blocked by her dbag bf 
 i clicked her name leading to her new profile which has a creation date of <unk> <unk> 
 it does n't say she 's married but her last name is still the <unk> and whats this 
 her town of residence is the very town she was moving away from just a short while ago 
 dbag is apparently her new # 1 and she liked his fb page <unk> 's <unk> <unk> so much for <unk> a year in-home <unk> <unk> <unk> i was almost sure that was all working out for him 
 another thing that surprised me was her photo : her head was <unk> 
 she previously had <unk> hair 
 now she kinda <unk> the dorky kid from undeclared 
 so to bring this all to a <unk> the apparent aftermath : she moved away to be with her husband who is in the marine corp florida they probably separated as a result of the fiasco i helped unfold and is now back in town with dbag no less who apparently could n't tolerate $ <unk> a year <unk> and instead <unk> for small time <unk> 
 shes trying to sell anything and everything on a fb <unk> page including popular board games as if everyone does n't already have three of these stashed somewhere and shes not <unk> so <unk> <unk> the picture gives me the impression that shes not really pleased at all 
 i imagine shes upset that she no longer has the big truck the <unk> the steady income the husband abroad providing all these things for her ... but in <unk> i feel shitty for potentially being the <unk> for her <unk> and <unk> <unk> but at the same time i do n't feel bad 
 the marine is free and gets to use his paychecks on himself and surely got his big truck and motorcycle back 
 i 'm not perfect and i 've made mistakes and to this day i 'm still <unk> what i 'd <unk> years ago 
 mistakes of this magnitude will teach you one <unk> and it is a fact of life : karma is a <unk> bitch ... <unk> freshman college year myself and a couple other friends had cars but many of our peers did not 
 whenever we went out as a group you 'd chip in towards gas to whichever car you were riding in 
 one guy though <unk> would always change cars at the gas station 
 it took me awhile to realize the scam 
 as soon as we 'd pull in he 'd get out to use the restroom then get in another car for the remainder of the ride 
 he 'd say he already paid the car he just vacated if asked 
 i never questioned that but it dawned on me that i 'd never actually seen mike hand over any cash 
 i asked my other friends about it later and everyone went through a round of sonofabitch '' 
 when we realized what he was doing 
 the next time we went out we picked a destination much farther than usual ~30 miles away from school 
 when we stopped for gas one car did not pull in but parked up the street 
 the other cars one he was in each went to the pumps as far apart from each other as possible 
 sure enough he gets out and heads over to the other one 
 but we both pulled out and left him there 
 i have no idea how he got back to school but we saw him the next day 
 i am pretty sure he never went anywhere with us after that either 
 **edit : ** re : being in /r/pettyrevenge or /r/regularrevenge i did not know those even existed 
 i did read the sidebar before posting and thought this fit here - *your story should be about getting back at someone who wronged you in generally an interesting and/or funny way 
 * the response was coordinated between myself and two other drivers and was in reply to someone 's douche behavior we discovered was chronic 
 i 'll add this was well before everyone had a mobile phone bag phones were still rare then 
 if he used a phone it was from a <unk> booth dropping in coins 
 he got back by either being <unk> lucky and catching someone in the dorm who he could talk into driving ~30 miles to retrieve him or by hitchhiking back 
 there was no <unk> or <unk> option and even <unk> would have been few out there 
 my guess is that he hitched back 
 this happened in northern ca where 2 when miles out of town you are in a long stretch of <unk> until you hit the next town 
 whatever method he used the getting back part would have completely sucked 
 i do n't remember much of the aftermath but i was quite likely relieved when i heard or saw that he made it back 
 but only about this much & gt & lt 
 disclaimer : i honestly think this is more /r/pettyrevenge than /r/prorevenge but this fits the rules here more than it fits the rules there 
 i also think it 's petty because we did n't have one final <unk> de <unk> against him 
 still with me 
 here 's the story : & gt the year is 1995. there 's me who i 'll name kevin o'malley 
 i do n't hide who i am on the internet but i 'm not gon na make this an <unk> by <unk> myself and getting banned 
 there 's my wife who we 'll call alice o'malley and my boss who we 'll call mark green who she never met 
 & gt alice and i worked in seattle for <unk> 
 i was 20 and we had 2 kids 
 i was teaching for them - you name it : word <unk> excel <unk> access <unk> photoshop - basically every single thing that existed at the time 
 alice was doing inside government sales 
 we got job offers in dallas at the corporate hq 
 i would be training at the flagship store down the street and she would be doing major gov't accounts 
 & gt because i was young and had n't finished a university degree i had trouble getting certification to teach in texas 
 my manager told mark all about me but he did n't really pay attention 
 when i got there he quickly realised that it was n't legal for me to teach the public since i did n't have tea certification 
 he also decided he 'd rather have someone else 
 however i was well-connected within the company and was friends with people far above him 
 he tried to drag his feet on my tea certification as my sponsor 
 i could get it 
 i had enough college and work experience but he was trying to force me to quit 
 & gt mark goes to a big convention in la for government sales as we sold training to the gov't as well 
 alice being in gov't also has to go 
 the company has gotten rooms for everyone at the same hotel 
 the first evening i get a call from my wife 
 & gt '' this guy was trying to touch me on the elevator 
 he was <unk> me touching me and <unk> me '' 
 & gt '' <unk> gross '' 
 i say 
 well you 're a big girl 
 tell him to fuck off 
 knee him in the balls or something '' 
 & gt '' i will if i see him again 
 she replied 
 & gt i thought nothing of it 
 that was that 
 & gt a few hours later i get a call from my wife 
 she seemed pleased with herself 
 you could hear her smile beaming through the phone 
 kevin 
 she excitedly <unk> out you 'll never guess what i did '' 
 & gt i 'm somewhat <unk> as i 'm thinking she 's won the lottery or something 
 uh what did you do '' 
 & gt '' you know your manager mark '' 
 & gt '' yes yes alice 
 of course i know mark 
 he 's the bane of our fucking existence 
 he 's threatening our ability to be able to live 
 fuck that guy 
 what '' 
 & gt in the most serious tone i had ever heard out of her she says mark is the guy who was hitting on me '' 
 & gt i pause and say ok so what happened '' 
 & gt alice says well i was at the bar and he comes up to me and i 'm sitting there with my <unk> having a drink and talking to <unk> my co-worker 
 he comes up and starts touching me <unk> me touching my ass 
 i tell him to stop 
 we 're all wearing <unk> from the convention but he was n't 
 he looks at mine and says <unk> and starts to pause '' 
 & gt she goes on i ask him what his name is 
 he says <unk> mark green 
 i instantly figure it out 
 i say to him 'do n't you know my husband 
 and he looks kind of <unk> 
 <unk> kevin o'malley 
 and his face turns white as a ghost and he leaves '' 
 & gt i say to her go tell virginia the training director right now 
 go tell her right now '' 
 virginia is a friend of mine because i created and developed the first internet instruction course for us in <unk> and we <unk> it to the entire company 
 it was really successful and part of the reason i had a name for myself in the company 
 & gt alice goes and finds virginia 
 she tells him how he kept touching her and hitting on her and did n't take 'no for an answer 
 how he was dragging his feet on my tea certification how he did n't know who he was hiring and failed to tell us this was even a problem 
 and virginia calls me and i explain all of this 
 & gt virginia is an <unk> feminist and the only female executive 
 older lady 
 she was not impressed 
 mark returned early from the conference 
 my tea certification happened quickly as in people from up high in the company pulled strings to get it done 
 & gt mark was n't long for our location 
 our store was the flagship we had the biggest accounts and it was by far the most prestigious 
 before he was moved laterally to a different store with no future my wife used to call me at work and call his direct line to ask for me 
 she would pick me up at work and come in with our kids 
 he would close his door every time she was there 
 every time i asked him for something i got it 
 and i made it a point to ask him for stupid shit 
 all the time 
 and then he left for the crappy store and eventually left the company for good 
 the /r/justiceporn <unk> to it was that it really helped my standing in the company as well as my wife 's to bust this guy 
 we both <unk> with the executives regularly 
 in the end before he left i ended up in a regional position above him but laterally 
 i suppose the irony was that he was trying to make me quit but they put him in a position with poor bonus structure and he ended up quitting and they did n't have to pay out the severance package of his <unk> n't know if it belongs here but <unk> bodily harm is involved so maybe 
 growing up i had a friend we 'll call dave 
 as far as we ever knew dave was likely the result of a mother who had been doing a number of drugs for most of her pregnancy as well as heavy drinking 
 when he was around 4 his mother dumped him and his little brother with his grandmother and promptly ended up in jail for attempting to rob a bank 
 his grandmother decided that his younger brother was an angel and he was somehow evil 
 dave had issues 
 doctors said he had all of the signs of antisocial personality disorder at around 12 and ended up being sent to a special school where he basically <unk> farther and farther from human interaction ... that is aside from with me 
 dave was <unk> smart liked sports could play any musical <unk> that you handed him within a week and we had basically everything in common 
 in spite of what doctors and his family seemed to think dave was a totally great person 
 he was such a good friend that one time when he came to me and admitted that he had feelings for a girl i was dating and she admitted to liking him i immediately gave them both my <unk> and remained friends with him ... not her though 
 she for some reason was angry that i was not upset that they were happy 
 that 's another story though 
 dave and i ended up taking martial arts together for years as well 
 it was an awesome outlet for me since i was home <unk> and did n't get to meet many people and him since he turned out to be amazingly talented at martial arts i was not shocked by this 
 the thing was as cool a guy as dave was with me and our tightly packed group of friends he was in fact a <unk> <unk> bastard 
 he did not like fighting but more often than not i could assume that if dave was speaking to someone we were going to end up in a fight 
 we were 16 year old boys 
 not too bright all around 
 so dave 's grandmother has decided one day that she would punish him since his little brother had broken down the door to dave 's room 
 it was obviously dave 's fault for wanting to have privacy by her logic and so he was sent to <unk> the roof of his house this is apparently a fitting punishment for wanting privacy 
 i found out and as you do when your buddy needs help i suddenly found my ass up on a roof with a hammer pulling off old shingles ... and completely terrified of the 2 i just went and looked a few minutes ago it 's not 3 story drop on the other side 
 while i am up on the roof i hear voices 
 i slowly and <unk> walked my way to the edge of the roof 
 almost straight below me i see a local dealer we 'll call him fats everyone else did is threatening dave 
 he is threatening him with a <unk> in his coat pocket which no one can see 
 now we live in <unk> city 
 there is about a 30 % chance that there is actually a gun in that pocket 
 i 'm trying to decide what to do when he pulled his hand out and to my surprise he is holding a cheap <unk> style <unk> knife of the kind you get when you 're like 12 and think you 're a badass now 
 well i can only partly remember what happened at that point 
 he cut dave and it was fairly bad 
 there was instantly blood visible 
 i then took one giant step off of the roof with the idea in my head that i would land on this fucker and kill him 
 i had completely lost it at the thought that my friend might be dying and i was totally fine with the idea of going to jail for killing this asshole 
 good/bad news for me i did not land on him and instead hit the ground directly in front of him doing damage to my knees that i 've never really recovered from 
 good/bad news for him 
 i did not kill his ass but when i fell my <unk> came directly down on his collar bone shattering it in a completely horrifying and <unk> way 
 how i did n't break my forearm i do n't know but this kid looked like someone had hit him with a wrecking ball 
 he screamed and took off right away 
 i can only assume shock is what kept him awake because we heard days later that his collar bone had been broken in like 3 places as had several of the ribs below it from the impact 
 dave as it turns out had gotten a cut across the forehead and was otherwise fine 
 it also turns out that dave was getting ready to hit fats in the face with a claw hammer when i came falling out of the sky like some <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 according to him the sun blacked out for a brief moment a flash of pale white boy descending from the heavens and then two fat guys on the ground screaming 
 he had no fucking clue what happened 
 he helped me inside and after a bit we with all of the <unk> medical knowledge two 16 year olds can muster reasoned my legs were not broken 
 i then limped home and went to bed while he went back to working on the roof 
 we never saw fats again after that 
 turns out a lot of people did not like him and when he was suddenly completely unable to defend himself he thought it was a good idea to leave maryland for good 
 edit : sorry if this is a bit rambling 
 a bit drunk and remembering old friends i have n't seen in years 
 wanted to share the story with someone 
 edit 2 : added line into story from comments about my pale ass falling from the sky like it was the dawn of the final day 
 edit 3 : doctors said he displayed all of the signs of antisocial personality disorder not that he had it 
 sober now sorry for the misunderstanding 
 edit 4 : finally got off my ass and walked up the street to look 
 2 stories from where i jumped not 3. makes sense in retrospect since we would have had to place the ladder at the lowest part of the roof 
 fear and bad memory was definitely making me remember it as being way <unk> met my buddy pat in the early <unk> when i was a sophomore in high school 
 he was a <unk> vet living in a <unk> old apartment in a <unk> <unk> on <unk> west coast 
 the units were pretty run down with cars young <unk> <unk> children running about and the various kind of yard <unk> one might suspect 
 i guess he’d taken a shine to me because i was intrigued by him working on various cars boats and the fact that he 'd sneak my 16 year old self beers just to have someone to chat with 
 also pat was in the midst of a nasty divorce 
 sometimes these things happen when you decide to <unk> with a cocktail waitress 20 years your younger but such is life 
 she’d taken him for nearly everything which wasn’t much to begin with leaving pat almost completely broken <unk> 
 almost ... because she left him moose a white <unk> dog of questionable <unk> 
 moose was great pat would take him to bars dye him green for <unk> <unk> day and they were always <unk> 
 if pat was working on a <unk> boat while sucking down a <unk> and <unk> <unk> light in the 90 degree heat moose was right there with him all day long 
 about 3 months after the divorce pat’s ex called demanding the return of a beloved childhood stuffed animal a small unicorn 
 <unk> her father had given it to her he’d recently passed and she realized it was the only remaining item she’d forgotten to <unk> with 
 i’m sitting there <unk> the phone conversation wondering what the hell she’s bitching about when pat closes the call with “fine you worthless whore i’m going out of town but will be back in a month you can collect your fucking unicorn <unk> slam 
 pat looked at me and a <unk> smile crossed his <unk> teeth 
 after explaining the call he leaves the kitchen to fish through some dusty closet boxes and <unk> the <unk> unicorn 
 “moose ” he calls and moose comes running per command 
 eyes wide and <unk> moose sits and <unk> master’s command 
 “moose here’s your unicorn ” and pat tosses it down to the <unk> dog who eyes it for a moment 
 it may be fair to mention at this point that moose is not <unk> 
 he then proceeds to doggy fuck the ever living hell out of that unicorn like the <unk> was lodged somewhere in its fluffy soul 
 word travels fast in shitty communities and soon “moose go get your unicorn ” was the <unk> saying 
 damn near everyone would pass by and mutter those words only to have the <unk> run inside get the stuffed love toy and proceed to <unk> that thing like <unk> business 
 a month passes and poor unicorn was looking haggard missing an eye and all <unk> 
 bitch cocktail waitress finally pulls up one <unk> florida day in her chevy celebrity to collect her <unk> possession 
 after some unpleasant words exchanged she demands her unicorn 
 a small crowd had gathered and pat’s moment had arrived 
 finally after losing everything it was time to mutter the sweetest words of <unk> i’d ever previously or ever will hear again : “moose go get your unicorn ” roughly 14 years ago i was a naïve kid and went to a car dealership to buy my first used honda 
 i had enough money saved for a down payment but the stereotypical used car salesmen upgraded me to another more expensive car 
 it had just been <unk> in earlier that day so it was still in the service shop 
 i got the service <unk> sheet claiming all the work that was done and the main one being brakes replaced '' 
 i take it home and after a few days of <unk> to the new car i notice that my brakes are <unk> 
 i call the dealership and they tell me over the phone that honda 's do that made a record of <unk> of rep 
 i ask around and sure enough they confirmed what the dealership had told me 
 over the course of the next 4 months the brake noise upgraded from a <unk> to a squeal and by the end of the 4th month a <unk> was heard 
 i bring it into the dealership and they tell me *your brakes are completely worn to the <unk> 
 you have maybe 5 % left at best 
 that will be $ <unk> to repair the <unk> '' i speak to the service manager <unk> who was no help 
 i find the salesman and anyone else involved with my sale and none of them can help me as the <unk> states <unk> were <unk> '' i 've never heard of brakes going out in less than 5000 miles 
 i finally get a hold of the general manager gm who flat out tells me <unk> you 're a kid guys like you race fast and brake hard 
 i 've replaced brakes at 2000 miles before 
 * '' he wo n't do a thing for me 
 they replace the brakes but one of them is n't <unk> on well and on my way home the brake pad falls off its housing its still attached by <unk> and i call a tow truck on the dealerships expensive 
 i have the guy take the ultra long way back as they bill by the mile 
 i pick it up the next day and nothing is said about it 
 i <unk> for 6 months telling my story to all that care to hear me 
 finally a friend of a friend hears me out and is familiar with what to do 
 he helps me to write a letter to the better business bureau and notify news agencies 
 i 'm to write help me '' articles to newspapers even call up talk radio stations for advice 
 i takes several weeks and nearly 60 envelopes later i had stacks upon stacks of letters going out to various agencies and companies 
 two months go by and i had gotten a few news agencies that were interested but the big one was the bbb 
 my case worker chad says they will do an investigation and informs me that this is n't the first time said dealership has done this before 
 mine was the first where detailed records were kept 
 i had additional maintenance records going into the same dealership as well as secondary opinions 
 over a year had gone by since i bought my car and i take it back to this dealership for the last of my scheduled warranty maintenance 
 before i do so i go to a bbb trusted mechanic and have him confirm my brakes are good 
 <unk> miles and nearly brand new still 
 at the dealership i avoid everyone that might recognize me and i speak directly to the mechanic 
 he does the last of the warranty maintenance and i ask him to check my brakes knowing full well that the service manager and gm had written notes about me for future reference chad warned me of this 
 he confirms what chad had told me would happen 
 *your brakes are almost worn out 
 you must ride them hard as they were replace about 8 months ago 
 you should probably get them replaced again 
 * '' i ask the guy to write all this down and he refuses to make it on the official paperwork 
 but <unk> on dealership letterhead instead 
 <unk> works 
 i fax this information to chad and some time later i get a phone call from the gm of the dealership 
 i do n't remember all of the half hour long conversation but he was attempting to bribe me with free service vehicle upgrade with a pay the difference catch blah blah blah if i would <unk> the unfair accusation '' i made against him and his store 
 i was <unk> him for all it was worth and i finally said <unk> know being that i drive my car like a <unk> <unk> * **i would be <unk> if the dealership replaced my nearly new tires brakes and oil and transmission fluid 
 i <unk> <unk> on cars after <unk> 
 he was verbally pissed at my attempt to rub what he said in his face 
 he hung up claiming i was being unreasonable 
 i never did get my refund for the brake job i never should have paid for 
 it took 3 years and several more complaints from other customers but the dealership was forced to close down and sell 
 chad tells me it was mostly because of my detailed <unk> and persistence that led to that dealership going under 
 <unk> dr : dealership sells me a car with bad breaks and lies to cover up their mistake 
 i call the bbb and the dealership is eventually forced out of business 
 ** <unk> : if the mods want proof this happen i will gladly give it to them upon request 
 <unk> sorry to have upset a few of the <unk> <unk> : wow thanks to <unk> and <unk> i found out a lot more what actually happened 
 bbb probably took my evidence information to the da or attorney general and the <unk> probably got involved 
 with enough evidence they were able to bring down the corrupt dealer or force them to sell 
 *not me but my brother a couple years ago 
 he is a mechanic and tow truck operator in a small town 
 a while back he gets a call for a job a guy wants to buy his son a used pickup truck but it 's in another town and needs some work the client says it 's a lot of work apparently but it should be a fun <unk> project 
 he hires my brother to pick it up 
 my brother gets our there and it 's in surprisingly good condition the big thing is the tires are shot 
 he <unk> it to his shop calls the dad and explains he actually got a pretty good deal 
 brother offers to install some new tires and do a little minor work and the truck should be ready to drive 
 dad happily agrees and gives the work the go ahead 
 two days later and the truck is running 
 my brother takes it over to the house and leaves the bill on the seat 
 five or six days go by with no word from dad so my brother calls in to ask how the truck 's running 
 great '' 
 says dad 
 so my brother asks about expecting payment dad says he 'll be in first thing in the morning 
 the next morning rolls around no dad 
 same thing for a few more days 
 my brother reaches him again and now gets a little run around with dad trying to say the truck 's not running so well 
 dad does n't really know vehicles though so his bluff is n't really working 
 my brother says he 's willing to work on other problems or recommend other mechanics but he still needs payment for work already delivered 
 at this point dad starts mumbling something about how he wo n't be scammed and hangs up 
 dad <unk> my brother 's calls for a week 
 so my brother calls the local police to explain what he 's going to do then calls me to ask if i want to see something funny 
 i say sure and he picks me up and takes me to this guy 's house in the afternoon on a friday 
 the truck is parked on the street and has been driven recently 
 a police car pulls up at which point my brother says hi to them then starts loading the truck onto his tow truck 
 after a few minutes of <unk> teenage son comes out of the house freaking out 
 he 's a brand new driver and thinks he parked wrong or something but my brother explains that his dad did n't pay 
 son goes inside to call his dad 
 my brother <unk> around the block for a better angle then backs the truck completely into the driveway 
 he pulls out lifts the truck on jacks <unk> the tires them <unk> the whole thing onto a couple <unk> then puts another bill on the windshield for the time he spent at the house 
 we all then leave and my brother closes up his shop before hearing anything 
 he does n't hear anything until wednesday next week and it 's a call from <unk> 
 apparently dad spent a few days lying to his family saying my brother was trying to scam them but eventually fessed up 
 mom was fuming because her car was blocked in the garage the whole time by the truck 
 she came down in person and paid my brother cash for everything plus more to come back and reinstall the tires 
 the best part unfortunately i did n't get to see but mom made dad apologize to my brother in front of their son when he reinstalled the <unk> discovered this sub and love it 
 thought it would be a great place to share my story 
 two years ago i lived in a <unk> area of <unk> and worked as a server and bartender at a fairly well known canadian restaurant chain 
 it is no <unk> to state the front of house manager foh assistant manager <unk> and general manager gm are among three of the dumbest people i have ever known in my life 
 my four months working at this place were fucking awful and soul crushing but the tip money was unreal so i could tolerate it 
 this was essentially the management <unk> : foh was a lazy fuck who <unk> his own laziness onto the front of house staff 
 he was prone to giving <unk> about how lazy we all were and constantly threatening us with a stack of <unk> '' he had in the office 
 he would also make insanely creepy remarks about female employees one of whom was my sister so super awesome and racist comments about customers 
 <unk> was essentially the kind of person who never had any power in her life 
 she then used her new power to make our lives miserable 
 her first order of business was removing any information about workers rights from the premises 
 finally gm was just a manipulative sadistic <unk> who was just straight up abusive to female staff 
 also these three people hated each other and made no attempt to hide it 
 basically by the end of the tourist season i gave no fucks about my job and wanted out 
 i started a work to rule strike which <unk> slowed down operations in hopes of getting fired 
 fortunately foh decided to stop scheduling me which led to an intense confrontation where he was very sure that i a fairly physically <unk> guy was going to beat the shit out of him 
 instead i told him to fuck himself went home and read the employment standards act in its entirety 
 i wrote a lengthy report to the ministry of labour citing at least 16 violations of the employment standards act 
 for the better part of the next year they were under investigation which resulted in me getting a pay out for termination constructive dismissal and them getting a number of fines 
 the sweetest part being every time i heard from my case worker she spent a good amount of our conversation bitching about how awful the management was to deal with 
 the last i heard from her the ministry was still doing regular inspections of this restaurant since they 've now been red flagged for shitty labour practices 
 so <unk> post might 've turned out a bit too close to something from <unk> but i hope it 's alright 
 not sure how pro it is either but i think it 's a bit too much for pettyrevenge 
 so a little background story 
 i 'm currently in my last year in school not quite sure what grade it 'd be in america but i 'm <unk> right now so late highschool early college 
 the year before this was n't very productive however and i had very poor attendance and not the best grades 
 however in the last months of the year i pulled myself up from the ground talked to my teachers to see what i needed for a pass and then spend day and night studying and writing to achieve that 
 now my history teacher was rather lax about the whole thing only asking me to hand in one task before summer came and he 'd give me a pass 
 summer came and went school began <unk> and we switched systems so that i could n't see my grades 
 a month into the semester however i was called into a meeting with the <unk> where she explained to me that she had arranged for me to take extra history lessons to make up for my failing grade 
 this stunned me and i went straight to my history teacher to ask for an answer 
 he dismissed me at once saying that he never got anything and that i had n't handed it in despite both emailing it and leaving a printed copy on his desk 
 i offered to give it to him once more but he just said this is just how we 're going to do it 
 you 'll have to attend class '' that 'd be the biggest problem 
 the extra classes i got put in 
 scheduled at the same time as four other subjects 
 now i had to run to those teachers ask to do stuff at home beg for them to mark me as present despite me not being so 
 as here in <unk> you will lose financial support if you go above 10 % absence eventually things have settled down with an extra 2 hours of studying every day to make up for it 
 when sitting in class and hearing about the <unk> for the fifth time however i was not only <unk> bored frustrated by the huge waste of time but also angry at my history teacher 
 so when he <unk> on about how ceasar was stopped just short of achieving <unk> power i took my first stab 
 actually did n't the <unk> vote him dictator <unk> 
 which quite frankly was n't very far from absolute power '' 
 <unk> i 'll have to check that later 
 anyhow he was <unk> by a group of <unk> led by brutus who we think was his <unk> '' is n't that considered highly unlikely by <unk> today 
 given that ceasar at the time of brutus birth was merely fifteen '' 
 and on and on 
 i 'd give him four or five sentences interrupt him whenever i could add something which he missed or point out something that was wrong or considered unlikely 
 i knew he was very <unk> about dealing out any sort of disciplinary action against me and i think i went as close to the line as i could even making him say no i think you 're wrong 
 let me look that up real quick '' and googling something before having to admit that i was right 
 i read ahead in the <unk> but when that proved to be <unk> i started frequenting <unk> listening to the <unk> history of rome '' and look things up especially common <unk> before i knew we 'd cover them in class 
 i think i 'm driving him mad 
 he has apparently consulted my mentor bringing up the subject himself that maybe he should n't miss all those classes to be in mine '' but she knows my situation and assured him that it 's fine and we 've got something worked out 
 he has started to avoid <unk> and started to just hand out an <unk> tell us to check the textbook and google for the answers and then disappear 
 all i know is that i will continue this and since i 'm learning i 'll get a good grade too 
 edit : yes i tried to show him the sent email however as i mentioned earlier the school switched <unk> for their online stuff from a provider called it 's learning to <unk> 
 thus i can not access my previous school <unk> originally posted this to /r/pettyrevenge but soon realized that this revenge was n't really petty and was assured of that by some redditors so i figured i might x-post it here for those who might be interested and/or do n't browse /r/pettyrevenge <unk> so my 11-year-old little brother was born <unk> months prematurely and despite the doctors giving him <unk> chances of <unk> let alone <unk> normally in the event that he should survive he did and is fully functioning except he lacks in certain areas such as drawing and <unk> 
 he draws worse than a <unk> in kindergarten but he ca n't help it 
 so one day the teacher in his art class collects all assignments looks at my brother 's work starts laughing and commenting at it and <unk> it around the class saying this is the kind of crap you 're not allowed to bring in '' and did you use your toes to draw this or something '' 
 among various other things in front of the whole class 
 my brother naturally did n't want to attend art class anymore and told my mother about this afterwards and mentioned she 's been saying mean shit to him for the entire 3 months he had taken her class but not as bad until now 
 **revenge** after having told my mother about this she was naturally <unk> and went to his school the very next day only to hear the same teacher making rude remarks about other students of hers behind the <unk> class door 
 my mother just stood there for a bit and eventually smiled at the teacher and asked if she could have a word 
 the teacher was mortified <unk> harder than <unk> but finally managed to stop <unk> and shaking and came out of the class to meet my mother 
 just a note : at this point she had no idea who my mother was or what she wanted she was just shitting bricks because she knew my mother had heard the how she talked to her students 
 so they started talking about my little brother and her remarks and once my mother was done explaining his situation regarding shitty artwork she handed the teacher her business card with a date and time on the back and told her to be sure to show up 
 oh yeah i probably forgot to mention that her title on said business card says : head inspector '' of the <unk> county department of education 
 the teacher was suspended without pay for 30 days and was made to take some sort of classes on ethics and communication 
 tl dr : my little brother who was born prematurely was made fun of by his art teacher since he ca n't draw well due to being born early my mother who happens to be the head inspector of the county 's department of education confronted her teacher gets suspended without pay for 30 days and has to take mandatory classes on ethics and <unk> is from <unk> in <unk> : some twat in a company van cut up this man who was driving his family around and later verbally assaulted him 
 unfortunately for this twat he had a <unk> <unk> and is a web developer 
 he bought the company 's website and posted the whole story and video there 
 enjoy 
 i had a relationship with a girl some time ago i 'm 18 and she was 17. we had sex over the summer and her parents freaked out when they found out 
 they threatened to charge me with <unk> rape even though my state 's age of consent is 17. our relationship ended and that was that 
 a few weeks later she and i began talking again i found out they took all of her electronics and had started <unk> her severely 
 her school social worker contacted the police when the signs of physical abuse started to surface but the police did nothing to stop it 
 she attempted to move in with her grandparents but it did n't work 
 she eventually burned down their garage to try to get herself removed from the home because she felt that anything was better than living with her parents 
 her parents kicked her out the next day she got home from school and her belongings were on the front lawn and her keys no longer worked 
 i caught wind of this and was furious 
 it was wrong of her to burn their garage to the ground but their beating her and such was too far 
 the day after i find out about all of this i 'm at starbucks with my best friend and my ex 's parents show up 
 her dad sees me and asks me to talk to him outside 
 i 'm a pretty scrawny dude and he 's not so i cautiously agree 
 we go outside and he gets so close i can feel his breathe on my face 
 he starts throwing out words threatening to kill me telling me to watch my back <unk> cetera 
 i told him to calm down several times and not to cause a scene 
 eventually he backed off 
 after this encounter i was fuming 
 this guy was threatening my life was essentially blaming me for his family falling apart because he 's a dickhead and acting just like a total <unk> 
 so i decided to get back at him 
 i called the police and found out what i could do as far as the law and found that i could attempt to charge him with assault among other things but i decided a psychological strike would be much more effective 
 so i contacted dcfs 
 i told them everything about what had just happened with their 17 year old daughter explained the abuse keeping my own incident out of the matter and dcfs went in to investigate 
 they removed the 12 year old daughter from the home as it was deemed unsafe due to the parent 's violent tendencies 
 they are allowed no contact with her for the time being last i heard their marriage was on the rocks as a result of the stress brought on by loss of their daughter 
 their middle daughter who i had relations with is glad i made the call as it got her little sister out of a dangerous environment 
 i felt that making them lose a child and almost destroying their marriage was sufficient revenge for threatening my life 
 might still get the police involved 
 well this is a long story - using throwaway account as friends know my reddit name 
 beginning : i was born in india 
 when i was 10 i moved to a small country town in australia when my dad got a job here 
 it sucked 
 i was small fat brown had an accent and didnt understand the culture 
 a bunch of racist <unk> at school bullied me and life sucked 
 thankfully i kept my grades up and got a scholarship to study science at a major <unk> in a major city 
 during my first day of <unk> at university i notice there is a shy awkward looking chubby indian girl sitting by herself 
 her name was rani and she too was from a rural town 
 she had just moved up here with her second cousins 
 we quickly bonded over how bad high school was and how nice it was to be in a multicultural city 
 we ended up having a lot of mutual interests and joined the same <unk> at our university video games board games indian <unk> clubs <unk> dancing etc 
 within a month or so i asked her out first girl i ever asked and she said yes 
 we dated in secret and became each others first <unk> kiss love relationship sexual partner etc 
 after a year of secret dating she moved into my apartment 
 life was fantastic 
 we never fought had 0 problems had similar <unk> + friends constantly attracted to each other had sex every day etc 
 it was perfect - just two love birds building a life together 
 problem : well after dating in secret for 2 years we decided to meet each others families 
 my parents are conservative muslims but knew i was going to date around 
 they were just happy i had chosen an indian girl they could relate to 
 her parents initially were very harsh and <unk> 
 however when they met me they immediately fell in love with me 
 the only problem was they wanted us to get married 
 rani and i had already talked about this 
 we both wanted to get into medical school after our <unk> 
 we both wanted a family and the white picket fence but we had both decided to wait on that until after medical school 
 however after meeting her parents and some <unk> i decided to speed up the plan 
 my plan was to ask her for marriage in 2 years time when we 'd finished our <unk> 
 we would get married in the 5 month break after <unk> - do a bit of travel - have a honey moon and then commence medical school as husband and wife 
 in the meantime i decided i was going to lose all my excess weight and become the attractive <unk> she deserved 
 both her and i were fat and we never had any issues with our weight and <unk> to each other and i didnt care if she remained fat for the rest of our lives 
 i just wanted to improve myself and make myself the attractive man she deserves to be with 
 <unk> : rani was <unk> supportive of my weight loss 
 she liked the new me and how much energy and confidence i know had 
 after 1 year i had lost <unk> and hit my ideal <unk> 
 i started lifting and was building muscle mass 
 rani started getting more insecure in herself 
 i would reassure her that i had no issues with her weight but we started getting into more fights 
 she was annoyed with how id always cook my meals and i wouldnt eat out with her as much i spent all this time at the gym etc i was too attractive for her etc 
 i would reassure her all the time that this wasnt the case but things kept getting worse 
 with 1 year to go i let rani 's father in on the plan 
 i asked him for his consent to marry rani on the proviso that we 'd get married after graduation so that we wouldnt have to worry about a wedding whilst trying for med school 
 he said yes and was absolutely excited 
 with 8 months to go rani started acting really cold and weird 
 i knew something was up 
 at first i thought it was the stress of med school entrance exams and coursework etc 
 2 weeks into the <unk> i opened up her laptop to look up this tenancy agreement thing regarding our <unk> 
 i see a <unk> message from this guy that was highly suspicious 
 rani had this friend that looked and acted like that dumb fat brother from my name is <unk> 
 he was absolutely ridiculously socially inept annoying and very <unk> 
 he was very fat and had bad bo all the time 
 he was in the board <unk> <unk> clubs with us 
 looking over her skype messages rani had been bitching to earlbro about our relationship for the last year or so 
 earlbro had confessed his love for her a couple times which rani had knocked back 
 2 weeks ago rani and earlbro must have cheated 
 earlbro wanted rani to break up with me but rani was saying this whole thing was a mistake and to shut up 
 well i saw red and immediately packed up my shit 
 i printed the messages out 
 i tell my landlord that i wont be <unk> my lease 
 i text rani that i know and that we are through 
 i quickly move most of stuff i dont have much most of our stuff was <unk> into my friends house and tell my friends to <unk> me from rani 
 well rani found out and went ballistic 
 she apparently ran home and saw my stuff gone 
 she went to our mutual friends house and started <unk> her eyes out 
 she tried contacting me but my friends deleted all her messages etc 
 apparently earlbro was a drunken mistake she never wanted to hurt me etc the reason she cheated was because she thought i was getting fit so that i could find a better girlfriend and upgrade from her wtf 
 could i please meet her for another <unk> ... blah blah 
 i decided i was never going to talk to her ever again something which i have successfully achieved 
 revenge 1 : rani 's dad started blowing up my phone a day after dumping rani 
 he <unk> demanded an explanation on why i broke her heart 
 her 2 older brothers also called and made threats etc 
 i didnt reply to their voicemails 
 instead i sent a huge email out to both rani and my parents 
 in the email i wrote out a heartfelt message explaining how id <unk> rani and i getting married but she had cheated i copied in the screenshots of her message and that i apologise for causing a scene and diminishing our families status indians care a lot about family status but that id really like my space so i can <unk> on getting into med school 
 within 1 hour of sending the email out rani 's dad phoned up 
 he was very apologetic 
 he said his girl was very sorry and it was a mistake 
 he said he would drive up and beg at my feet to take rani back and offered me money wtf 
 i accepted his apology but said i dont want any further contact with her or her family and wished them all the best 
 a week later rani 's family drove down to our city 
 they took rani back to their country town and pulled her out of her courses 
 she didnt graduate on time and couldnt apply for medical school 
 she returned 1 year later to complete her course but she failed 
 she ended up living at home unemployed for a year before going into a retail job 
 she put on massive weight and now looks like a bloody <unk> 
 word got out to the indian community about her cheating and her family was <unk> 
 rani is now massively depressed and her family has resented her for bringing down their status in the indian community 
 revenge 2 : i went off to med school in another state 
 a bunch of indian parents got in contact with me to tutor their kids 
 one girl i <unk> amina blew me away 
 she was studying science and wanted to get into medicine 
 she was gorgeous both inside and out 
 she had a <unk> smile and lit up the room 
 most importantly she had a beautiful sole 
 she was active in her community and volunteered a lot not because it would help her get into med school but because she actually cared 
 after <unk> her for a year i knew i was in love with her 
 i asked her out but she declined 
 she said she liked me too but she is religious and only wants an arranged marriage as per <unk> law 
 despite not dating her i knew she was my dream girl so i contacted my parents 
 my parents and her parents <unk> our marriage on the proviso that we would be engaged for 2 years until both she and i graduate our respective programs 
 during this time we started dating as <unk> weird i know 
 years back rani and i had made a bucket list of romantic activities we would do together as a couple 
 amina found the list 
 i explained the situation to amina and she said she liked the list and wanted us to complete the activities with some modifications 
 we aimed to complete the list before our marriage 
 amina took photos and scrap booked all our memories as we completed them things like <unk> a mountain <unk> dancing great <unk> <unk> <unk> etc 
 a couple months before our scheduled wedding amina published our scrap book on facebook 
 somehow rani found access to the scrap book 
 she sent a <unk> message to amina saying she stole her idea 
 amina messaged back a <unk> message saying how terrible rani is how bad it must be to lose someone like me and that the <unk> was our idea together before we 'd get married 
 hearing that i was getting married must have pushed rani over the edge and she threatened to take her life 
 she had to spend 3 weeks at a mental health ward 
 it was a massive <unk> in our indian community 
 this was 3 years ago 
 revenge 3 : ive been married to amina for 2 years now and things have been perfect 
 she is now in med school and im a junior doctor 
 we 're trying for a baby now 
 last sunday my father called 
 one of my dad 's friends from another city was trying to arrange a marriage for his son 
 rani 's parents had contacted him with a proposal 
 my dad 's friend called up my dad to get an idea about rani before they introduced her to his son 
 my dad forwarded my <unk> email to this guy and then called up and told him rani 's story of cheating dropping out of university depression etc 
 needless to say that guy ran for the hills and cancelled the arranged marriage 
 he was very thankful for my dads advice and said he would warn the other indian people in his state about her history 
 <unk> : so thats that 
 in the end i didnt even have to talk to rani these past years to get my revenge 
 all of it was delivered on a silver platter by karma 
 i have a <unk> wife a job i enjoy whilst all rani got was misery and <unk> 
 all this because i wanted to lose weight before i proposed to her 
 its probably not pro-revenge but i still get a kick out of it and maybe some of you guys who are <unk> with love will find some <unk> reading this 
 just passing the karma on 
 gather around it 's going to be a long post 
 it 's also getting things off my chest finally 
 okay so this story sets in india 
 my gf at that time was in university and living in a house with around 6 other housemates 
 she was fine with all of them except 1. we 'll call her fb 
 fb was the type of housemate that made sure that my gf 's life there was miserable 
 she 'd do something almost every day to upset my gf 
 sometimes it 'd be little things like stealing her food borrowing her shit without permission and not returning it etc 
 other times she purposely chipped off parts from her coffee mug that i got her as a gift slashed her bike tyres would n't let her and other housemates in at 1am when they was returning from a party and left them stranded <unk> 
 you get the picture 
 the house they were living in was for <unk> only 
 guys were allowed but then asked to leave after 12am where sometimes <unk> security checks happen 
 i say <unk> because they had n't had a security check in the 1.5 years she had lived there 
 fb 's boyfriend lived with her for a week with no consequences either 
 so it 's no surprise that when i came for a 2 week stay over to the house from another country because we were long distance the landlady got a <unk> on the first day and a security check happened where i got kicked out 
 with nowhere to go at 1am and a kind of remote region my gf decided to sneak me back in to stay the night and leave in the morning for a hotel 
 when i climbed up the <unk> to go upstairs to her room she saw me 
 we locked ourselves in the room but then there were cops after 30 mins that showed up because fb claimed that i raped '' her and touched her '' 
 wtf 
 i did n't even acknowledge her 
 so the cops interviewed us for an hour and her parents were called they live in a different state explaining what she had done and a big deal was made 
 she had also been told she would be denied a stay for the next semester current semester ending in a month 
 i was let go due to the false accusation everyone at home said it didnt happen but still out in the streets at 4am sitting on the bench with the nothing to do but plot my revenge 
 so it begins 
 **step 1 : petty <unk> after living with my gf in a hotel room for 2 weeks indian hotels are really cheap on the last day i go back over to her house in the morning boys are allowed at this time and the house is empty since all the girls are in classes 
 fb has her room locked but my gf has the house keys with all the locks 
 so she opens the door to her room 
 the first thing i do is mix sugar and water it really <unk> ants and spill a fuck load making a trial from her window to the ground 
 then i move her matress up and strategically place sugar water over all the corners of her matress 
 before i could even move to phase 2 i could already see the ants piling up 
 *phase <unk> i go over to her private bathroom and there are 2 <unk> there 
 my girlfriend is n't sure which one is hers so she calls fb 's roommate to confirm 
 roommate hates her too 
 i take the toothbrush outside and douse it with mild <unk> and leave it out for a while 
 i also take her deodorant spray and put more pepper spray on the nozzle and entrance and let it out for a while 
 *phase <unk> it had been one of the housemate 's birthday the previous day so there was <unk> cake in the fridge 
 gf just knew that fb will want at least a slice if not the entire thing to herself 
 so i went out to the garden opposite the house and picked up a small chunk of dog poop and put tiny pieces of feces not visible on the cake 
 gf warned the other housemates not to eat it since it 's a prank and later on she bought another cake for the girl 
 *phase <unk> i pissed on her soap bar gf took picture 
 *phase <unk> i put a lot of powder on the rims of the overhead ceiling fan 
 such that when she comes home around 5 and turns the fan on her room would be covered in powder 
 *phase <unk> i leave the gas on in the kitchen and since she 's a smoker the moment she lights a cigarette the house would burn down 
 okay i 'm kidding about this one chill guys but i did almost briefly consider on the night that i was accused for rape 
 **step 2 : petty revenge in <unk> so the best part of the revenge starts when i take the flight back home and wait for my seeds of destruction 
 i reached my country back at around 9pm india time 
 my gf tells me that the powder thing just happened so she was pissed and crying about it to the landlady who basically did n't give a shit and asked her to suck it up 
 i send her an international text message i have a data plan to send cheap messages saying you should put powder more often it makes your face look <unk> '' 
 the same night gf sees that she took a slice of the cake i text her saying what you did to me was quite shitty '' 
 she responded whatever '' 
 i responded speaking of shitty behavior how was the cake '' 
 no response 
 gf says she could n't hear anything in the room all night 
 she caught on to the toothbrush prank so that did n't work out 
 she just texted me nice try asshole i 'm going to use this as proof '' 
 she took it to the landlady who again did n't give a shit 
 however she used the deodorant and it was so effective that they all had to leave the house for 2 hours 
 enjoying the weather outside '' 
 lastly after my gf had switched houses the next semester i sent her the picture of me pissing on her soap bar 
 at this point the landlady could n't do shit so fb took it to the police who also did n't do shit 
 after all that happened why are you so pissed '' 
 insults <unk> ... **step 3 : pro revenge** okay so if anyone in the world is still reading this all this counts as just petty revenge 
 the real pro revenge comes in here 
 i found out who her boyfriend was since he studied in the same university 
 i made a fake instagram account of a girl and every week i 'd upload a new picture 
 i made it looks completely <unk> 
 i had about 350 followers 200 following and around 50 posts spread over 3 months 
 i started messaging the boyfriend talking to him telling him that i found him attractive etc 
 it got to a point where he was like i 've actually broken up with her now '' 
 i call my gf and and confirms with her roommate that they 're very well still together 
 screenshot conversation 
 send to fb 
 send text pity your boyfriend is cheating on you maybe if you were n't such a bitch ... '' for the <unk> de grace 
 idk if i said it right when i went over back to india after 6 months her roommate had just about had it with her and was going to move out too 
 she was in charge of the house keys that day and she was in the university 
 so i picked up the keys from her went over to her room again and planted weed under her bed 
 new matress btw then later on at night my girlfriend tipped off the landlady about a guy <unk> 
 so there was a security check but instead of a guy the security found the weed 
 they have a 0 drugs policy 
 she blamed it on her roommate who said she was in university all day so there 's no way she could do it 
 the roommate also <unk> to fb using the drugs and bullying her into not telling anyone 
 my gf also <unk> the same 
 she was kicked the next week 
 2 lessons in life do n't do drugs and do n't fuck with the devil '' the uni she went to was in <unk> 
 idk if i can post the name or if it 's breaking privacy rules of the subreddit 
 people always smoke pot there it is n't that hard to find weed 
 cops do n't care uni does n't care 
 anyway that is the story of my greatest pro revenge 
 i 've had many of revenges but nothing this intense 
 hope you bastards enjoyed it 
 i am both proud and ashamed of this one ... it was a warm summer night and i was leaving my favorite bar with a friend of mine 
 we decided to take a short walk to the top of the parking deck a block away wanting to top off the wonderful night by doing some sightseeing while enjoying our beer buzz 
 on the way there while passing under a window a <unk> <unk> <unk> substance falls all over us getting in our hair and clothes 
 upon smelling the <unk> sandy stuff that fell on us we quickly realized it was used kitty litter that someone had thrown out of their window 
 and it was putrid 
 you know if the cat lady was crazy enough to throw her kitty butt <unk> out of a window this bitch most likely had neglected the shitbox for a while so we had what smelled like half a <unk> worth of kitty piss and shit in our clothes and hair 
 now my ex used to live in the apartments that the kitty litter came from so i knew exactly which window the cat shit sand had been thrown from 
 my friend and i <unk> up to the apartment door and knocked on it so we could tell the <unk> perp that this wasn’t <unk> london and it is inappropriate to empty your chamber pot into the streets especially if you don’t look to see if there are any <unk> below 
 i knocked and could see under the wide crack under the door that they turned off their light and pretended not to be home 
 originally i was just going to reprimand the cat <unk> culprit assuming they were either drunk or mentally ill but now this disgusting <unk> <unk> was going to just pretend like they weren’t home 
 what a fucking pussy 
 a revenge plan popped into my head and i pulled down my pants so i could take a piss on their door to let them know how it felt to be <unk> by a <unk> 
 but i had a <unk> those french fries and pitchers of <unk> were brewing something foul in my bowels and i told my friend i couldn’t pee because i had a turd <unk> is when a brown light build went off in my head 
 while my friend was laughing in <unk> disbelief i further pulled down my pants and dropped a <unk> log the on their door mat 
 and this wasn’t just any <unk> <unk> this was a <unk> and <unk> french <unk> feces <unk> out of my butt like a <unk> station from the 9th layer of hell 
 luckily the <unk> culprit had a <unk> <unk> in their <unk> but tonight it was not being used for clean up 
 i took that <unk> and used it to push my <unk> <unk> under their door so when they eventually opened it my surprise <unk> would <unk> into their apartment spreading a brown rancid revenge <unk> on their floor 
 tl dr : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and pee all over me so the putrid <unk> gets a personal pie reply 
 when i was overseas in iraq on my first <unk> i decided to take advantage of our limited tuition assistance it 's free while active duty and does n't effect our gi bill benefits and take a few general ed classes to get a jump start on my degree 
 i chose a computer class i work in it simple stuff and a health class 
 no big deal 
 i chose the community college in my hometown which we will call mcc because well ... it 's my hometown and it made sense 
 before starting the class i confirmed that the school would accept military tuition assistance 
 <unk> the fact that i got c 's in both classes because the instructors did n't allow me to make up the tests that i missed while in transit back to the us even though they said they would let me ... that should have been my first clue 
 several years after these few classes i was getting out of the military when i received a bill in the mail from mcc for the two classes 
 i called the education office on base to ask them what had happened and they informed me that they did n't know - they had sent a letter to mcc to tell them where to send the bill for the classes 
 i asked if they would send another letter so they said sure and they did 
 a few months later i got a call from mcc saying they still had n't gotten paid and i had been turned over to collections 
 i asked if they ever got a letter informing them where to send the bill to which they replied that they did n't 
 at this time i still lived in southern california near camp pendleton so i went on base to the education office and asked them for a copy of the letter informing the school where to send the bill 
 my hometown was 400 miles away just close enough for a short vacation 
 so i drove home and walked into the school with the letter and handed it to them 
 at this point the woman in the tuition office informed me with a very unpleasant tone that pretty much reeked of i do n't want to deal with you '' ... & gt mcc tuition lady : we do n't accept military tuition assistance 
 & gt me : but i called before i ever even enrolled and asked if you did and somebody in your office here said you did 
 & gt mcc : no that 's wrong 
 we accept the gi bill not active duty tuition assistance 
 & gt me : how could somebody have gotten those two mixed up 
 this is the veteran tuition office 
 you 're supposed to know the difference 
 & gt mcc : well somebody was wrong 
 but your balance is still $ 255 for your classes and all the fees 
 & gt me : why do n't you guys accept active duty tuition then 
 & gt mcc : well a few years ago we did but we never got paid so we stopped accepting it 
 they never paid 
 & gt me : how long ago 
 are we talking semesters or decades 
 & gt mcc : well before i worked here 
 i 've been here for five years so it 's been a while that we 've had this policy in place 
 & gt me : ca n't you guys try billing them this once and see if they will pay up 
 does n't it make sense to at least try rather than leaving your students to get screwed and stuck with the bill 
 i mean if they do n't pay now fine i 'll handle it 
 but why not just try to send them the bill 
 i 've already spoken with the tuition office on pendleton and in <unk> florida where the main office is located and they 've said they will pay they just need to be sent a bill 
 i 'll even pay for the stamp if you 'll just mail them a freaking bill 
 & gt mcc : well if they want us to accept their tuition assistance they need to approach us to work out a deal on payments 
 & gt me : lady they 're the united states military 
 they 've got hundreds of thousands of <unk> around the country whom they are paying for and taking care of 
 they have bigger things to worry about than one community college in a <unk> town 
 they 're not going to come to you 
 you 're the school who wants the money - you go to them 
 at this point i left fuming because now i have a collection agency calling me all the time over two c 's that i did n't even want 
 i was already going to school somewhere else and had started over 
 wtf was this mess all about 
 after some thinking i decided to write a letter email whatever to my congressman explaining everything that has happened and how i 'm stuck with the bill 
 i mean the point is n't the money - i could pay it 
 but what about all the other vets from my area who want to go to school there 
 what about the people after me who got stuck in the same situation 
 after writing a letter to my congressman i decided to get the people involved 
 i contacted all the local news agencies to see who would do a human interest '' bit 
 publicly shame these jackasses 
 i found a friend of a friend who has a weekly column in the local newspaper 
 i gave him the full details along with a picture in my dress blues per his request and he said he 'd help me out 
 yeah you can see where this is going now 
 a few days later i got a call from a representative at our congressman 's office - i did n't know that stuff actually worked 
 i explained to him in detail all the trips i had to make back and forth going between the school and the education office on camp pendleton delivering papers by hand because the school did n't want to cooperate 
 he said he 'd make some calls and try to get this resolved 
 a few days later the article ran in the paper 
 it was n't front page stuff of course our town has enough crime that human interest stuff falls aside but right there was a picture of me in uniform and a few paragraphs about how the school is screwing me over 
 a few hours later the woman from the tuition office calls me back with a very different tone of voice 
 & gt mcc lady : hi <unk> i really want to help you out with this 
 let 's see what we can do to get this resolved 
 i found out that the representative from the congressman 's office had called her the same day the article ran and she was getting leaned on heavily from all her superiors 
 she sent the bill to the proper location and my bill was paid in full - very quickly 
 the very next day the school president called a meeting to rewrite their policies on how they handle military students 
 **tl dr school declined my tuition assistance was crappy to me about it and sent me to collections 
 i got the local media and my congressman 's office involved 
 suddenly the school was willing to take the money 
 <unk> up in a typical suburban neighborhood i frequently had to interact with the typical neighborhood bullies 
 my bad luck however was that the local bully lived right across the street from me 
 even worse the whole family – kid my age his older brother and parents – all exhibited the same lack of social <unk> and were all equally <unk> by not only those around us but by seemingly everyone they interacted with 
 they seemed to <unk> in their bad <unk> and it was clear by the lack of <unk> correction even when an adult called out one of the <unk> that there would be no change in their demeanor 
 the father would routinely get into physical <unk> with <unk> whose dogs stepped foot on his meticulously <unk> lawn the mother would threaten law suits for slander against the elementary school teacher when summoned to discuss her children’s behavior 
 the community pastime was discussing the latest <unk> some member of the family had committed 
 now i mentioned the father’s lawn – his pride and joy even more so than his children judging by the amount of time he spent in <unk> it 
 my home had a prime view of his treasure as we sat up on top of a small hill looking down and across the street on it 
 summer mornings were frequently started by him firing up some <unk> to coax a little more green out his grass or blow some <unk> leaves that dared trespass within the <unk> of his fifty by thirty foot plot of <unk> 
 it was annoying but we knew better than to complain 
 someone however decided action was needed 
 to this day i have no idea who the culprit was i often joke it was my mother but she adamantly denies the <unk> but whoever our <unk> <unk> was my hat is off to them 
 it was a slow burn and started innocently enough : the father asked my mom if she had noticed any dogs <unk> in his yard while they were on vacation 
 of course we hadn’t but even if we had she had better sense than to <unk> another fight in the neighborhood 
 she assured him she’d keep an eye out and keep an eye out we did 
 it soon became clear the <unk> grass was taking a turn for the yellow in a couple spots right in the middle of the <unk> lawn 
 within days the plan came into stark clarity : a perfectly executed “fuck” spelled in six foot bright yellow <unk> grass letters 
 the father was irate and his bully sons began interrogating us kids in an effort to calm his ire 
 my honest <unk> served me well and saved me a beating but it <unk> my interest in the caper even more 
 i watched with <unk> attention through our front bay window as the <unk> dug up the offending <unk> 
 many <unk> were shared in our home while we watched him realize he had replaced a yellow “fuck” for a dark brown “fuck” <unk> 
 he quickly fixed the problem by spreading new seed and laying hay over the whole mess 
 oh but it was a slow burn as i previously mentioned 
 a week or so later we watched as he <unk> up the hay plastered to the young grass by regular watering and <unk> 
 once it was all up and bagged he stepped back to admire his work – the once yellow then brown “fuck” was now a bright green young and healthy <unk> he exclaimed so loud enough to hear over our air conditioning 
 bully dad had the whole crew outside in no time all armed with shovels and <unk> and eventually dug up and <unk> the whole yard 
 a few weeks passed and all had returned to <unk> 
 that is however until i noticed another small patch of yellow pop up in the middle of the new grass 
 i would like to start off by saying that i am not a spiteful person but after reading a post regarding someones revenge on a former boss i was reminded of a former ass-hat manger that i had a hand in getting fired 
 i am a chemist by trade 
 i work in a lab mixing chemicals together to make <unk> products for consumers 
 i once worked for a company that made all types of plastic 
 they were in serious need of a chemist and a friend whom is the vp recommended i interview 
 the job was to be the lab manager 
 i would be responsible for 3 other <unk> and two <unk> employees 
 i went through the very long interview process and was offered a job 
 however it was not the job that i interviewed for 
 the management team '' decided that i was too young i was 25 so they gave to the job to someone else who was older 
 that person would be the ass-hat manger 
 i was given a chemist job 
 it was a good job and it paid well so whatever 
 so my first day on the job i am introduced to ass-hat 
 upon meeting him he seemed to relish in the fact that he got the management job over me and immediately started to show it 
 the lab was going through somewhat of a <unk> 
 the previous manager was a pack rat 
 as in he kept every single piece of paper that was ever handed to him 
 so my first assigned task was to go through every single piece of paper to see if it was relevant 
 i had to physically remove each piece of paper from the box and scan it over for said relevant info even though the box clearly said <unk> on it and all it was was <unk> from shows or old ass chemical <unk> i still had to go through it 
 this took me weeks 
 i was the only person assigned this task everyone else did there normal job 
 in the mean time he was busy showing up for work late leaving early for his two hour lunch disappearing for and hour and a half after lunch and leaving work early 
 he maybe was seen visible working for 1 hour a day 
 fast forward to me finishing my assigned task ass-hat finally allows me to do some actual chemistry work 
 this is when i found out that he has no real experience working in a chemistry lab 
 or being a chemist 
 how do i know 
 because ass hat decided to mix a couple of chemicals that do n't play nicely with each other '' and then proceeds to throw it in the microwave 
 60 seconds later we were short one microwave and had a new respect for the fire extinguisher 
 he followed this up with leaving industrial sized <unk> on high speed while unattended big no no they could kill someone starting another small fire in the plant and completely ruined an industrial sized mill 
 after a couple months of his unsafe lab practices they continued i started noticing some changes in his personality 
 specifically towards people that he deemed a threat to his authority 
 he got into a very loud verbal argument with our first production manger who then quit then proceeded to get into an almost physical argument with one of our salesmen whom also quit 
 once those two were off his list he turned his attention towards me 
 now for a little back story 
 i mentioned earlier that i was friends with the vp 
 i still am i have worked for him before and i enjoyed it a lot 
 hence the reason i applied for the job 
 i am the type of person that shows up early and leaves late 
 always have always will 
 i take great pride in doing good work 
 well ass hat took our friendship and my work ethic as a threat to his authority and made it his life 's goal to fuck with every single part of my day 
 he would assign me jobs to do i would do them and then he would berate me in front of everyone about how i did it wrong 
 then he would tell me how to do it right '' and i would fix my mistake and do it exactly how he told me to and he would come back and berate me again in front of everyone about how it was still fucked up 
 he did this for everything 
 the best part about all of this was the end of day meetings '' 
 these meetings '' consisted of me going into his office closing the door and him yelling and swearing at me for at least 30 mins 
 <unk> you ask 
 think of one it was probably my fault in some way 
 this went on 2-3 months until i cracked 
 i cracked because he got physical as in shoved me when my back was turned 
 now i am not a small person 
 i am <unk> built 
 i played football i ran track and i lifted <unk> 
 i do n't know what got into him but it got into him in a big way 
 i was shocked 
 i had never had a boss do that before 
 i do n't know why but i just let it happen 
 so when he was done screaming in my face i just left and went straight to the bar and had a drink and another and another 
 that was the day i decided that i had had enough 
 i was n't putting up with anymore bullshit 
 i am admittedly not a very creative person when it comes to revenge so the only type of revenge on a boss that i had ever seen way before reddit was from the movie office space 
 i literally did what that guy did 
 i just showed up and did absolutely nothing 
 i came and went when i wanted 
 i took 45 minute smoke breaks 2 hour lunches came late and left early 
 this drove ass hat insane 
 and every time he tried to talk to me about it i did exactly what the guy on the movie did i just never stopped and walked right past him 
 every time he wanted another meeting '' i just never showed up 
 i just went home instead 
 so after a week or two of this i happen to be wandering around the office and i stumble into my vp friend 
 he seemed stressed out and i inquired as to why 
 the safety inspector is here and he will be doing a walk through of the plant '' 
 he said 
 he told me to let everyone in the lab know that he was here and not to fuck up '' 
 his words not mine 
 well because i had literally quit doing what i suppose to do and ass hat had to do what i was suppose to do and seeing that he is a walking fucking <unk> i took off for my 2 hour lunch 
 i wander back into the plant after my 2 hour lunch my food was excellent and shit has hit the fan 
 every big <unk> in the company is in there and they are all freaking out 
 i walk up and the first thing the vp asked me was what did you see '' 
 being friends with him i replied i did n't see shit what happened '' 
 so word on the street is this 
 ass hat decided that he owned the place that day and went out and used one of the industrial stand up <unk> think kitchen aid mixer that makes cookies but 8 feet tall to mix something in a 1 gallon container i was suppose to be working on this project but obviously was n't 
 now these things are made for containers that hold <unk> gallon containers 
 so he puts this container under this gigantic mixer and realizes that the container cant be strapped down with heavy duty chains 
 side note : you need to strap down the containers 
 these things spin at <unk> rpm 
 i have seen 1000 gallon containers spin that weight <unk> 
 that 's some scary shit 
 so what does ass hat do 
 he grabs a roll of duct tape and tapes that shit on of course 
 once he <unk> that bitch with duct tape he <unk> that <unk> up to full blast and walks away 
 also a big no no 
 for those of you that do n't know all machines in any industrial shop have to manned at all times no exceptions about 2 minutes into this act of stupidity in walks the safety inspector 
 one of the production guys sees this gigantic fine running and promptly runs over and shuts the machine down right as the safety inspector sees it 
 over walks the inspector to inquire into what the hell is going on right as ass hat walks out of the lab freaking out 
 asking who shut off his mixer and of course cussing and swearing 
 he then proceeds to turn the mixer back on <unk> out the production worker and asks the safety inspector what the fuck are you looking at '' 
 and walks away 
 so once i am got done laughing my ass off i calmly inform my vp and all the other big <unk> that i am not surprised 
 i inform them of their lost microwave the <unk> the destroyed mill they knew about the mill they just did n't know how it happened 
 i told them about the confrontation that occurred in his office and i told them the truth about some other things they did n't know about 
 bottle of scotch in his desk drunk on the job etc 
 etc 
 the fire in my vp friends eyes was burning hot enough to destroy <unk> at this point and he turns around and tells everyone that there will be a meeting regarding today 's events in the morning and orders everyone 40+ people to go home 
 we show up the next day and ass hat was no where to be found 
 the point of the meeting was to inform everyone that ass hat was not allowed within 500 ft of the building and that if we saw him near the building we needed to call the police 
 what i found out later was that the police already had him 
 when my vp friend went to fire him ass hat got physical and the security guards with my vp friend got physical back 
 he was charged with a whole slew of shit to much to remember 
 later that day i was promoted to lab manager and given a raise 
 we celebrated with a glass of scotch that found in ass <unk> desk 
 i 'm a college student and like all other college student i 'm poor 
 i do n't get to do a lot of nice things 
 however sometimes i will treat myself 
 i 'm a huge fan of bubble tea one day my friend and i went to a bubble tea cafe near our campus to celebrate the end of midterms 
 this particular cafe is a favorite of mine because i know the manager 
 we 're on a <unk> basis and she 'll occasionally give me a free drink just because 
 i was hoping to see her again but a different woman was there sherry 
 i went up to the register and placed my order asking for less ice 
 sherry 's eyes bugged out and said we do n't do that here '' 
 i was surprised because all bubble tea <unk> do that 
 i repeated my request asking her if she could do if for me anyway even if it was n't an option on the machine 
 she cut me off and said no 
 i was speechless 
 this cafe generally had great customer service 
 i paid and them my friend ordered 
 sherry worked at a snail 's pace 
 instead of making multiple drinks at a time she made each drink individually 
 i watched her make my drink and to my surprise she added extra ice to my drink 
 after 15 minutes our orders were finally finished and my friend and i left 
 we headed back to campus 
 it was n't until we were in the dorms that i tasted my drink 
 to my surprise my drink was incredibly diluted and the bubbles were <unk> 
 this bubble tea was a waste of my money 
 i was so angry that i made a yelp account and posted a long detailed review about why my bubble tea was terrible 
 by chance my friend took me back to that cafe 
 i saw my favorite manager and she told me that sherry had been fired because of my yelp review along with other customers complaints 
 i asked the manager if they had a job opening and they did 
 i started the week after working what used to be sherry 's shift 
 one my first shift i noticed that you can input the customer 's ice preference 
 **tl dr : ** woman makes terrible bubble tea 
 i write a bad yelp review 
 she gets fired 
 i get her job 
 now for this revenge you 're gon na need some backstory ... senior year of high school i moved to a new school did n't know anyone except i met this one girl who we 're gon na call r. now r was at first seemingly a nice but strange girl 
 she admitted she liked me and as i was <unk> from my previous relationship we hit it off 
 after about 4 month of us being together i caught her cheating on me 
 i decided that she was n't worth it and broke things off and decided to completely shut her out 
 my life started getting better i started making new friends and things were looking up 
 that 's when the rumors started 
 they were small things but either way i knew she was behind it 
 i ignored them and went on with my life 
 a week later i hear from some people that her and her new boyfriend were caught having sex off the side of the road in the back of his car 
 i laughed and made jokes but i again refused to make any comments and left it alone 
 she confronted me in the halls in front of the principal and accused me of starting and spreading rumors about her 
 i told her she was n't worth the effort and i walked away 
 apparently the principal did n't like the <unk> <unk> she used against me and forced her to formally apologize to him 
 <unk> for the <unk> i came back to school after spring break to be <unk> into the principal 's office 
 shortly after sitting down a police officer comes in with papers 
 i was being served a restraining order against me for allegations of rape 
 her affidavit was along the lines of my ex boyfriend <unk> raped me last november 
 he has been spreading rumors about me and i highly suspect that he is the one behind the notes in my locker telling me to kill myself '' mortified i was sent home and unable to return to school for about a week 
 during that week i <unk> all the evidence i could against her 
 the fact that we stayed together for 2 months after the allegations and the fact that she spoke of me in such a loving tone 
 *not the tone of a rape <unk> 
 after the week was up i walked into court prepared for the worst 
 the judge a stoic man in his early 50s <unk> over the case and after all was said and done i had brought 2 boxes full of evidence both copies for her and for the judge while she simply read her affidavit 
 the judge dropped the order and i was a free man once again 
 now for the revenge 
 i left the courthouse and when the court recording was released and i was given a copy i immediately approached the detective leading the case against me for rape 
 he dropped the case and instead took up a case of perjury and falsifying a police report 
 she 's going to be spending a few years behind bars for what she did her new boyfriend left her strangely enough it was when she was being arrested he left her not when she admitted to him she made it up and she 's being disowned by her family 
 she fucked up and revenge could n't be sweeter 
 tl dr : girl cheats on me i ignore her she lies and says i raped her in court i get her thrown in <unk> mods said my post was n't petty enough for /r/pettyrevenge and removed it and someone was banned for suggesting i post here so i decided i should 
 i worked at a town home community as a leasing agent for 2 months 
 the job sucked and i had to work on the weekends but the manager agreed to let me have mondays and tuesdays off 
 if i did n't get a weekend i at least wanted mondays off because they suck 
 i worked by myself 95 % of the time 
 from the beginning i was barely trained and had no confidence in my job performance 
 i had no one to call when i had questions either 
 the assistant manager lisa gave me her login information in case anything i ever did needed a supervisor <unk> 
 that 's how little either managers were around 
 i was always by myself 
 when i first started i went to lunch with another leasing agent jessica who worked at our sister property 
 she was nice but talked shit on the company real quick 
 she told me that the petty cash for her property had been short $ 50 a few months ago and amanda manager of both properties had used her own money to force balance it 
 they both had to sign off on it for audit purposes 
 another <unk> - i had to input rent payments into a program on our system 
 lisa informed me that she lived in apartment 205 so that would always show up as not paid '' because it was different '' since she was living there 
 she told me just to ignore it and that i never had to worry about her 
 labor day is always on a monday so we were closed that day 
 when i came to work on wednesday the assistant manager lisa informed me that i would have to start working on mondays because they were just so busy 
 i was pissed 
 i took the job on the condition that i would have mondays off 
 i also was told i would n't be paid holiday time for labor day because it was a monday and i had that day off 
 so i was like thanks for deciding that i have to work mondays after the monday holiday 
 i was pretty open about my annoyance but whatever 
 so later on in the day i am checking my personal email and i have an email from career builder - i still get these emails 
 i am used to them 
 i had a profile on there with my resume and just never took it down 
 well lisa pops up behind me when i am looking at this email and calls and <unk> on me to amanda 
 amanda calls and is basically asking me what my problem is and blah blah 
 she told me jessica told her that i was negative when we went to lunch that day and i was just talking trash the whole time ha 
 i finally told her i was done with the job and she told me to give her my written <unk> notice 
 the next day i went to leave the property to go pick up lunch and lisa <unk> in as i am leaving 
 she gives me some shitty smirk 
 when i got back from my lunch she was gone 
 i got on my computer and my email was all arranged weird 
 it was arranged by <unk> instead of by date 
 i was pissed 
 i knew that bitch had been going through my email 
 so i remembered that she gave me her login info and i logged into her shit to see how she liked it 
 there were several emails exchanged between lisa and amanda calling me a brat and a bitch and just talking all kinds of shit 
 i tried to dig up any information about lisa living in 205 but nothing existed 
 everyone else had a folder of info but there was none for <unk> there was not a spare key either 
 she was living there for free and i knew it 
 so i decided to email the main guy who worked at corporate 
 i told him lisa was living on the property and what her apartment number was i told him about the petty cash fraud the going through my email them never being there etc 
 i left my work shirt provided by the company along with my keys and had the maintenance guy sign off on a paper saying i did just that 
 then i took a copy and left the property in just my <unk> and skirt no fucks to give 
 i turned off my phone and changed the voicemail to the message you get when someone has their phone turned off these chicks were n't exactly brilliant 
 i got a call from the maintenance guy later that evening telling me that amanda did try to call me and thinks my phone is off and he had to help lisa move all of her shit out of her apartment that day 
 it was n't fast enough because the guy i emailed flew in the next day and cleaned house 
 lisa and amanda were both fired 
 tl dr some bitches were bitches to me so i got them <unk> friend of mine owns a bar he has 4 '' cctv cameras 
 only one of those cameras points to the bar tending area where he can see the actions of his employees 
 i 'm there having a beer its early 5 pm and i 'm the only one when i see the employee go into the backroom and then comes out 
 something seems off guy is a bit strange 
 guy asks me so you know dean the bar owner pretty good '' 
 i go yea '' he goes yea ... i just helped dean install a brand new cctv system in the bar i know this a lie cause dean and i installed those cameras together '' i go yea ... thats cool how many cameras 4 '' 
 he goes yea all high <unk> '' this was a bit strange to me 
 why we are talking about this 
 then i noticed him slipping money from the register into his pocket i call him out on this bullshit 
 he says dude dean makes plenty of cash how about this i 'll give you $ 20 and we call it cool '' i fire back give me $ 40 '' he goes alright '' i then say hey man let me buy you a drink '' so we have a drink and i <unk> him on his little scheme 
 i then say got ta go out for a smoke '' its around 6 pm and i call dean up and say dean your bartender is stealing cash from you your 5th cctv camera caught him pretty sure he turned off the other cameras '' dean thanks me says to keep him busy until he gets there 
 so i go back in and we start shit talking dean 
 and then dean walks in with two lovely police officers and dean immediately says get out from behind the bar the cops are here to arrest you for theft '' the bartender fired back dude i did n't steal and you do n't have any proof '' to which dean responded you turned off the 4 cctv cameras but you do n't know about my hidden one '' guy is told to sit put by one officer as another officer goes back and reviews the footage 
 its clear as day this guy is stealing 
 bartender is currently awaiting trail 
 his case should be open and shut 
 dean refused to take the $ 40 back from me and i got my tab for free that night.my former wife loves to take expensive vacations 
 we live in ohio which doesn’t exactly have <unk> places to see unless you like to watch grass growing or interstate construction 
 while we make ok money i’m convinced she felt the need to single <unk> improve the us economy by taking elaborate vacations : <unk> shows in new york city gambling in las vegas <unk> in arizona sightseeing in san francisco 
 the <unk> know me so well they ask about my dog when i call to make reservations 
 his name is fred 
 in my attempt to try and save whatever i could so the <unk> could have her nice things i bought this honeywell wi-fi enabled device so i could adjust the hvac while we were away piling up massive amounts of debt on <unk> mouse watches 
 i thought we could save a few bucks by keeping the temp cool in the winter and warm in the summer 
 the device was easy to install 
 i did not have the <unk> connector so i had to <unk> the green one - this required an <unk> to the actual hvac unit in our home 
 there are plenty of videos on youtube to demonstrate how to do this 
 within an hour i was up and running 
 the device works flawlessly 
 you can adjust the temp from anywhere you have a wi-fi or <unk> signal 
 little did i know that my ex had found someone that had a bit more money than i did and decided to make other travel plans 
 those plans included her no longer being my wife and finding a new travel partner <unk> a banker 
 she took the house the dog and a good chunk of my 401k but didn’t mess with the wireless access point or the wi-fi enabled honeywell <unk> 
 since this past ohio winter has been so cold i’ve been messing with the temp while the new love birds are sleeping 
 doesn’t everyone want to wake up at 7 am to a 40 degree house 
 when they are away on their weekend <unk> i crank the heat up to 80 degrees and back down to 40 before they arrive home 
 i can only imagine what their electricity bills might be 
 it makes me smile 
 i know this won’t last forever but i can’t help but smile every time i log in and see that it still works 
 i also can’t wait for <unk> weather when i can crank the heat up to 80 degrees while the love birds are sleeping 
 after all who doesn’t want to wake up to an 80 degree home in the middle of june 
 here is the original link i joined the navy when i was 18 ended up as a <unk> in iraq and afghanistan and when i returned found out that i was going to have to take classes to even become an emt 
 fuck that right 
 so i did the next best thing : i got a degree in economics 
 now i see you there grinning ear to ear 
 what an idiot right 
 well it turned out pretty well for me 
 i picked up a job for <unk> as a business consultant for a smallish company in the area 
 now i 'll use a <unk> for my boss 's name here he 'd be jeff 
 so i 'm 25 fresh with a ba in econ studying with sandy pants ai n't fun with a pretty decent job 
 jeff and i seem to get along the only problem is that he 's ... a product on the 80s 
 everything was about cutting corners and cutting costs as much as possible to stay stable in bad times 
 but this was around 2009 and my take on it was that it 'd lead to businesses continuing to drop out 
 they cut costs which cuts demand in the area which further kills businesses so we have to <unk> our areas further and further just to break even 
 and you know i 'm okay with this because where he 'd offer his <unk> in business i 'd offer mine from an economics <unk> and much of the time my ideas ended up with better results 
 well jeff does n't like this too much 
 he cut his teeth in business when i was still in diapers right 
 so he keeps moving me off projects and onto smaller ones where the commission is n't as great and the businesses are already knee deep in cost cutting so it 's almost impossible to turn it around as people keep leaving the area because they 've been foreclosed on 
 but that is n't what got me 
 oh no 
 we 're talking about a six figure contract now and he taps me to work on it because we recently lost a senior <unk> 
 this is my chance right 
 so i work with this business for months straight and slowly what started as a 10 % quarterly loss turned to 5 % then breaking even before finally turning a profit 
 it 'd be a nice tidy bonus for me 
 <unk> wrong 
 after the latest quarterly report pegged their growth at around 3 % they started slipping back again 
 why you ask 
 because my boss went over my head and started offering his own consultation 
 they 'd make much more money he reasoned if they just cut back on workers brought on some temps at half the pay of their staff or <unk> off of maintenance of their <unk> 
 so they started doing that and they started falling behind 
 my boss then blamed this on me and my delusions of <unk> '' and my <unk> '' 
 i figured out that he had been reviewing my work then replacing my suggestions and analysis with his own 
 they fired under his consultation half of their work force who knew what they were doing by then and replaced them with temps who ... did n't know what they were doing 
 the <unk> waste numbers blossomed higher than they 've ever been and they were mad 
 they wanted blood and my phone was ringing off the hook as they blamed me for their company 's negative <unk> 
 so i quit 
 but i was so damned mad -- <unk> than i was when a marine would shake me up at <unk> because he had guard duty at <unk> and the fucking french shared their wine with him 
 i was n't doing anything with my money 
 between extra from gi bill post <unk> money bonuses and my wonderful paycheck i already had a stable home and enough money saved up that i did n't have to work for about 10 years 
 but that 's not revenge is it 
 it started small 
 i worked out of my apartment calling up the small businesses that i had successfully consulted for over the couple years 
 freed them from the <unk> grasp of my former boss who had started filling their heads with fear <unk> about wasted profit 
 1 business turned into 3 then 10. jeff 's company was starting to <unk> because while the larger businesses paid much more because of their size and complexity the bulk of his profit came from the smaller quicker jobs with <unk> independent companies 
 with this new profit i put a down on a small property down the road from jeff 's office 
 one of the many businesses that shut down during the recession partly due to his corrupting influence 
 i needed more people so i hired a recent econ grad to help me out 
 i bide my time snatching up small contracts and working on pulling the larger ones 
 lots of driving <unk> and actively showing up 
 i finally returned to the company that had trouble before -- the one jeff threw me under the bus for and lo and behold who do i find 
 but jeff himself 
 the owner of this company was having a rather heated argument with jeff about the state of his business and jeff being who he was was talking his way out of it 
 so i roll up portfolio in hand filled with the successful reports from the small businesses i already took from jeff and as soon as he sees me his eyes go wide as dinner plates 
 in front of god and everyone i start my pitch i push this portfolio onto the owner and explain in cold calculating detail how i managed to keep these businesses running 
 the gears are turning in the owner 's head and jeff looks apoplectic before i add before jeff decided he knew better than i did i was doing this for your business too '' 
 all hell breaks loose 
 jeff just <unk> on me 
 you ungrateful little shit '' and after all i did for you '' nobody else would hire a college puke with no business experience '' 
 the owner had him escorted off the property and i offered my services to his company for free until he realized that i knew what i was doing 
 a few months later i had a neat little six figure contract of my own -- my very first one -- and i brought two more people on payroll 
 jeff was n't too happy though 
 oh no 
 he started sending me harassing e-mails <unk> <unk> or not at all threats so i responded the best way i could 
 i sent him a <unk> of flowers with my card and on the back of it sorry to hear about your business troubles 
 if you need a business consultation you 're welcome to give me a call '' 
 it is now <unk> and his business has <unk> 
 i 'm currently working from home due to a accident that broke my arm broke it in three places it is not fun but my second in command a woman who also served in iraq and now with an econ degree of her own called me on monday 
 we picked up another six figure contract and we 'll need new people 
 she had someone in mind for the position best resume in the pile a guy by the name of jeff with 40 years of business consultation experience 
 i told her to toss the resume and go for someone a little <unk> 
 feels good man 
 so fucking good 
 my family has had a run of bad luck this year 
 we had a saying last year 
 it 'll be better in 2015 '' 
 well early in the winter we were greeted with a call of did you know the marina is on fire '' 
 no we did not know that 
 my mother was in denial 
 we 'd gotten this call a few times because the fire trucks fill up by the marina sometimes and she figured it was just that 
 i did n't want to counter that the ice was over ten inches thick at least 
 i just hoped it was a <unk> fire 
 it was not 
 all that was left of the building was a tiny metal frame on one end 
 for a bit it seemed like we could twist this fire into a good thing 
 that building was <unk> * and we 'd never have been able to afford to bulldoze it 
 it happened in winter when we never make any money anyway 
 if there was a time for a fire to happen winter was a good time 
 the insurance called it a total loss so anything we <unk> did n't count against us for payout but we were able to salvage things 
 a brief rumour started that it was arson started by us -- i might do a post on who started that rumor and why it died so quickly -- but it was going good 
 then the lawsuit came in 
 we 'd had problems with these people before but a lawsuit felt a bit over the level of the <unk> they were capable of 
 they were suing us for harassment '' over the other issues destruction of family <unk> '' it was a tree a baby tree trespassing '' on property legally declared as ours and other <unk> stuff 
 we <unk> on the <unk> stuff 
 so an important thing to know about this area is that the property lines are <unk> 
 * when my family got the marina we were sorting out the property lines with four different <unk> 
 the <unk> were in bizarre places 
 one was in the middle of the building surrounded by another parcel 
 the reason for this is because we 're on the edge of two <unk> who both tried to determine the property lines and they did so by markers that do n't exist anymore or are now <unk> as the lake levels rise every year 
 markers literally in the original property lines are the old oak tree '' 
 we did find that one it 's a <unk> 
 they were the only people who refused to settle 
 we had to call in surveyors 
 our surveyor gave us <unk> of land 
 they did n't like that 
 so they called in a surveyor 
 their surveyor gave us another <unk> 
 oh yes we enjoyed that 
 but on their lawsuit they tried to go back to the original agreement before any of the surveyors 
 they had ... less than a stable case 
 we took photos of the property line from the water and lined it up with old photos 
 we got a new survey done after we heard they 'd tried to trick the system by giving a surveyor the property line and getting him to sign off of it 
 we used the same company they did 
 the surveyor gave us even more property 
 they are n't pleasant people to deal with 
 we had kept this really quiet taken the high road 
 however they shot themselves in the foot as expected 
 they put up orange plastic fence around their supposed '' property line 
 which their lawyer told them to take down and my uncle did rip down in front of them but it was too late 
 one of the <unk> of the lake asked us what was going on and we were kinda do n't spread this around but ... '' knowing he 'd spread it around 
 he did 
 the whole lake knew that these people were suing us the people who just had a <unk> fire take our <unk> 
 oh did it get nasty 
 we had people pouring in sneaking gossip to help our case 
 they had a history of doing this 
 we were told to get a look at this legal document and that 
 people with <unk> offered to drive by multiple times at <unk> hours which we explicitly condemned while looking pleased with the idea 
 because these people were just being so stupid i was expecting them to be <unk> through <unk> and shoot themselves in the foot during the court case 
 and thus according to state law pay all our legal fees 
 they did actually give in at <unk> 
 we got the property 
 they brought in three lawyers from a nearby large city 
 we had one local lawyer 
 they then fenced in their tiny <unk> property with their lawyer watching the whole time 
 someone dropped by to let us know their fence was n't up to county codes 
 if we report it they would have to rebuild it 
 we 've been a little busy but i think summer in the middle of their busy season is the best time to do that anyway ... **edit : ** some things : we are n't entirely sure what prompted the neighbors to sue us but the biggest reason we think is that they knew we were struggling financially and that we just got a whole bunch of money plopped into our lap after the fire 
 after all they were n't asking for just land but money from us too 
 the fire was probably caused by mice <unk> in some electrical wires 
 we know what wall it started on and there were some <unk> on that wall that kicked on and off all the time 
 only thing <unk> on that wall 
 i have pictures of the remains of the building and those <unk> are just <unk> 
 * everything in that entire area was <unk> 
 we are pretty <unk> around the lake and the fact that they decided to sue us after the fire was not gone unnoticed so it getting out as i pointed out several times would send the neighborhood friendly <unk> out if we could get spread the word in a way that did not trace back so clearly to us 
 like explicitly asking the source not to spread it around 
 they would not have sued us without the fire and the fire made the neighborhood 's reaction more extreme 
 i posted this to pettyrevenge some time ago and just happen to stumble across this sub and thought i would just share my story for your enjoyment 
 so here goes i live in a pretty large <unk> community and my house is currently going under some renovations 
 as with any renovations you get junk that needs to be thrown out so my parents decided to get one of those big containers that can be taken off and put onto the back of a truck it 's lifted onto the truck with a big mechanical type hook thing that 's attached to the truck to throw the trash out edit - it 's called a skip we got the container pretty late into the evening after the construction people had left and therefore it was empty for the night 
 the next morning however we woke up to the container being 1/3 full of random crap and a big ass queen sized bed that looked about 30 yours old 
 so of course my parents were pissed beyond belief that someone would just dump their trash into our container after we paid for it and now we do n't even get to use the whole thing 
 now on to the revenge part of the story as i was looking into the container staring in disbelief when i saw something sticking out of one of the trash bags lo and behold it was a letter ... with the <unk> address 
 what do we do 
 well that night me my brother and my father decided to return to these people all the trash that they so <unk> left in our container 
 but since they were <unk> enough to dump it in our container we decided to dump it all over their driveway and in front of their cars so they could not be able to leave without cleaning up 
 revenge is sweet and the neighbors did not even come and thank us for returning their stuff 
 how rude 
 tldr : neighbors dumped their trash in our skip gave it back to them ... all over their driveway i 'm back guys : another one from the car world 
 in my many years of being in this business i 've met very few natural sales people '' i am not one of them 
 i got to where i am by discipline thick skin and drive to succeed 
 i 'm not a mind reader and i stumble over myself from time to time 
 however every once in awhile i run across a gifted sales person and surprisingly they are some of the most difficult and often times <unk> sales people 
 they know they are good and therefore they think they have free <unk> 
 well as many of you know i work a group of dealers and over the years we 've acquired various dealers well i remember we acquired a new dealership it was a chevy dealership and i remember in my first meeting with the store manager we went over our staff 
 we where reviewing our sales staff and one guy stood out to me ... john who always seemed to be selling <unk> cars a month ... impressed with his numbers i mentioned this to the store manager who <unk> i asked whats wrong '' he went on to explain john is good and john knows he is good and therefore he runs lose with the rules and causes the mgt a <unk> 
 however the old owner put up with it cause he <unk> such a large portion of the dealers business 
 i however do not believe your performance gives you a free pass 
 sure if your a <unk> and make a mistake i 'm not going fire you over it but that does n't mean you can do whatever the fuck you want 
 i said thats fine i 'll watch john and his habits but first i 'll have a sit down with john and explain what is expected of him 
 so later that day i sat down with john a pleasant enough guy of course he would be and i asked him about his behavior he of course denied that he was a reckless individual just a top performer 
 that 's fine so i personally went over with our employee conduct code 
 now for those of you do n't know i have an employee conduct code it basically is a set of <unk> what we expect out of you 
 it includes things such as * no relationships with customers * no using dealership property for direct personal benefit * treat all customers and employees with respect * no duis * no drugs on the premise * leave home at home * be honest both to your dealership and especially to your customers * etc i then explain to him that him that i expect my employees to first follow the code of conduct then worry about business 
 john of course agrees and signs all is good 
 maybe he wo n't be a problem 
 not even 2 days later i was taking a <unk> outside the office in the doorway and john was to the left of me but could n't see me as there was a large <unk> blocking his view when i heard a customer approach john 
 the customer explained that he was here for another sales person he had an appt and was ready to buy ... i then witnessed john blatantly lie to the customers and explain that particular sales person was n't available and that he was instructed to take care of the customer completely not true 
 i walked away and found the sales person and i told him that john was currently selling his customer but not to worry cause i 'd transfer the deal to that sales person and he 'd get all the commission and do none of the work 
 john of course sold the customer proud of his accomplishment i approached john and advised that i witnessed him skate another sales person and reminded him that was against dealership policy 
 he brushed it off and said do n't matter i made bank '' to which i then advised him that he was getting $ 0 for his work and the sales person who had the appt will be receiving 100 % of the deal and this is to serve as a punishment for him 
 john was furious it was a nice check about $ 850 i reminded john i 'm the new king of the hill and i play differently and he needs to adjust 
 we go home for the day with no further incident 
 a few days later i 'm driving over to the dealership when i see one of our cars without dealer plates sitting in a red lobster parking lot this is completely against company policy 
 one a show car is to not be driven off our lot without dealer plates and show cars are not to be used for personal gain 
 i of course turn into the red lobster walk into the restaurant to see which one of my sales people are using dealership property for personal gain ... sure enough its john sitting there enjoying his meal i approach him sit down and the look on his face was priceless 
 i advise him he is using company property for personal gain and that is against our code of conduct 
 i then advise him he is suspended from work without pay for the up coming 4 day weekend 
 i also advise him i will have the car towed back to the dealership and he can figure out how he 's going get home ... he protests 
 says i ca n't reasonably expect him to walk home in this heat it was the summer and that he is very sorry ... nope not having it 
 i leave him be have the car towed back to the dealership 
 his suspension was enforced and he did n't work that holiday weekend it cost him a bundle too 
 he also got to enjoy the long walk back to the dealership in the summer heat 
 come that tuesday i sat down with him and explained to him that he is on his 2nd strike and another incident and he 's out of here 
 he did n't seem to take my threat seriously i advised him that even though he sells 30 cars a month i can easily hire 3 people to do his work and the dealership will still live on 
 a week goes by without incident and then on a monday morning i get a call from the store manager saying we need to have a talk about john so i drive over to the dealership and sit down with the store manager 
 he says i need to go visit john ... so i do 
 john looks like complete crap he has a black eye a bruised face and walks with a <unk> 
 concerned i asked what happened he says he made got into a <unk> with a family member over a personal argument 
 feel bad for the guy but he wo n't get into any detail 
 i advise him to do his best to look his best and let me know if he needs to go home early 
 i leave and i 'm by the front desk when i see a very angry man who just a few weeks ago bought a car from us enter our dealership 
 lets call him jason 
 he asks to speak to a manager i quickly get involved this is n't normal this guy is steaming and something is seriously wrong 
 i 'm deeply concerned that maybe a safety issue caused an accident or something like that 
 all i know is something is seriously wrong 
 i pull the guy into the back office he is fuming he is angry and he is pissed i <unk> him down advise him i 'm here to help him through his issue and that i would love to help him 
 he then finally explains what happened 
 a few weeks prior his wife and his worked with john name keeps popping up again and bought a car i wonder did john lie '' 
 or whats up '' he continues on and explains that last night he came home from a 12 hr shift to find john in his bed with his wife lets call her cindy ... he is <unk> angry is upset that we would hire such a person and then i inquire is this the reason why john looks like he got the crap beat out of him 
 he admits that he did beat up john and he feels that we should know what john is up to 
 i thank him for his time advise him i will handle this swiftly i explain to him not only will i deal with the sales person in question i gave him some extras on his car for free actually quite a bit i also advised him that this behavior is unacceptable 
 i pull johns phone log all of our sales people are provided with cell phones for work those phones automatically upload their call log to our system sure enough their is quite a bit of <unk> going on between john and cindy 
 starting after the sale of the car and into the evening ... this is not normal 
 your car sales professional should n't be calling/texting your wife at midnight 
 so i page john into the office and i ask him if he knows cindy 
 he denies it i show him the call log he admits that he does indeed know a cindy 
 i then ask him if he knows a jason he admits that he knows a jason 
 then i ask him did jason beat the shit out of you cause you where fucking his wife cindy '' 
 his head is down he knows the game is over he looks up and says it is 
 i then fire him the look on his face was priceless he protested he said you ca n't afford to fire me i 'm the top sales person i out perform everyone by at least a 2 to 1 margin '' to which i responded i ca n't afford to keep you on the payroll i ca n't afford having my sales people skate others show disrespect use company property for personal gain and fuck my customers <unk> i ca n't afford that and therefore your done '' that day john left for good know what the funny thing is 
 we saw an <unk> in business overnight our other sales people moral improved and every picked up johns slack and we sold more cars then ever ... since john left we 've never had a month worse then when john was working for us 
 tl : dr top performer thinks he 's we ca n't afford to fire him ... when in reality we ca n't afford to keep him.i had been hoping this story would make one more turn in my favor which would have ended in a higher level of /r/prorevenge but last night my revenge <unk> cooled 
 i 'm going to try to make this as short as possible but i really suck at making things short <unk> and there is a lot that happened 
 and now that i 've typed it all out short '' it is not 
 **the background** in august of 2014 i left my job as a <unk> to pursue a new position as a buyer for a major food packaging company in their production department 
 dispatching was second to my job of purchasing however the dispatching aspect left me working 10-12 hour days and being on call 100 % of the time 
 the new company promised it 'd be an easy 40 hour work week with occasional ot here and there 
 unfortunately for me i did not get this in writing and took the position as a salaried employee 
 i tried to negotiate a 6-month review with potential for a raise but was declined 
 oh well 
 the hours would be less and i was cutting my commute in half 
 the first month everything went well 
 i worked with some really cool people and i was proving i could handle the workload with ease 
 **the turn toward <unk> well right around the 1 month mark the woman that did purchasing for their maintenance department put in her <unk> notice 
 this was no surprise because everybody knew she was going to school to become an <unk> 
 what was a surprise is that i was now expected to learn and perform her job as well 
 i already had a pretty good grasp on the first position and figured taking on the second position would be a good challenge and further prove myself as a valuable employee with maybe an extra hour 's work per day 
 i asked again for a 6-month review which they agreed to again i did n't get in writing but it would n't matter in the end 
 through this company 's massive financial success they never bothered to upgrade their purchasing system for maintenance purposes 
 there was no inventory system nor any way to generate a proper purchase order po in the system so i had to manually type out everything onto an excel spreadsheet then generate a generic po in the system 
 then i had to track all purchases on a separate document 
 it was a very cumbersome system that led to me working <unk> days again 
 there was no way to track a specific item to any vendor without searching through hundreds of <unk> and hope someone wrote a decent description 
 at this point i was <unk> solely on the memory of the mechanics most of which had only been there for & lt 6 months 
 needing to do constant stock checks and asking the mechanics to teach me about some of the <unk> equipment so i could have some idea of what i was buying i was not always at my desk 
 despite having a radio on my side at all times the plant manager complained that i was never in my office and i needed to notify him via email or radio every time i walked away with a reason 
 this included going to the bathroom 
 this is n't elementary school and me not being at my desk does not put someone 's life at risk 
 i begrudgingly comply but this is the first major strike in my mind 
 the rest i <unk> up to a loss due to my incompetence not getting things in writing 
 still i wanted to turn this around and see if i could make this work 
 i learned the system we used was actually quite <unk> and with a few hours of initial setup i could build an inventory for the maintenance side in the system and generate clear and <unk> po 's 
 since i was salary i could come in on a weekend and knock it out 
 halfway through my proposal to the plant manager he cut me off and told me he did n't want to do it 
 i tried to explain how this would help the company <unk> and <unk> not to mention the sad sack that got the position after me having to deal with the same bs but he flat out said no '' 
 strike two 
 we 're now at the end of november and into the early part of december 
 the company is <unk> their <unk> sauce line and introducing some new recipes 
 i had to source several new <unk> and order huge <unk> for their first run which would begin in january of <unk> it was tough but i was making progress while also barely keeping my head above water in the maintenance department 
 then i am given the news that the woman in charge of purchasing all packing materials is taking a 2 week vacation for christmas 
 my requested time off for my birthday the week before christmas is being denied because i need to cover her position as well 
 why 
 the <unk> <unk> has not been trained on how to make a <unk> <unk> 
 so now purchasing anything for the entire plant rested on my shoulders 
 this is now strike three and i begin posting my resume and applying for jobs again 
 i was going to continue working until i found something anything else to get me away from this place 
 by this point i had already discussed quitting with my girlfriend and my savings would keep me from putting her in any <unk> harm for at least 6 months with current spending 
 when i got to work the day before my birthday i opened my email to find 16 emails from the overnight crew throwing me under the bus for not ordering a certain part 
 before i could get through all of them the plant manager was in my office explaining that i was <unk> and this could n't happen again at risk of being fired 
 i showed him the emails that proved the mechanics lied about when they tried to order the part me following up with the vendor to get a status and the fact that the mechanic only gave me half of the information the vendor needed 
 i again explained my plan that would <unk> reduce these issues if i had any sort of way to view past purchases and i would have known *exactly* what was needed 
 his response was just deal with it '' 
 strike four numb nuts 
 i neatly stacked everything i was working on depending on their status forwarded a few emails to back up my side to my personal email and sent an email to the plant manager hr and the production manager explaining that i was leaving the company and where everything was that i was working on 
 i included my address to send my final 2 checks to it was always wrong on my paychecks which i had several emails asking them to correct but they handed them out on payday so it was n't a huge issue 
 i collected my things and walked out the door passed all of their offices which were all empty 
 had they been there i would have stopped to explain 
 **the revenge** a few days later in what was the normal payday i received my typical automatic deposit 
 it was only for the last full period i worked and did not include the few days i worked into the next period or my accrued vacation time 
 i had also not received the check <unk> which arrived nearly a week later with the incorrect address 
 it was delivered to the address on the envelope and then finally made it 's way to me after being returned to the mail carrier 
 before i sent another email asking them to correct the address i decided to look up state laws on payment upon termination of employment 
 oh was it eye candy ... in my state if someone <unk> they must receive all owed payment within <unk> 
 for every day late after that they are to pay the person as if they were still employed if they pay on day 4 they are to add 1 additional day 's pay 
 also any previous agreement of automatic deposit is voided upon the termination of employment unless there is a written agreement at that time 
 there was also a list of state fines associated with each infraction 
 i composed my email to hr and explained the laws they were violating as well as requesting they update my address and if they would mail me my final check within two days i would not pursue any legal action 
 hoping they would reply with reason this would all be settled by the middle of the week which was dec 31 and also two days before the next scheduled payday 
 their response the next day stated that i would receive my automatic deposit on friday since i had agreed to that upon my initial employment 
 this time i replied with direct links to the state 's website and laws they were violating and stating how simple this would be in court 
 all i wanted was what i was due and not asking for anything extra 
 there was no response until the next day the deadline i gave them when <unk> knocked at my door with an envelope <unk> my check <unk> 
 not an active check 
 there were no deposits into my account until that friday when the normal payday was scheduled 
 at this point i 'm actually impressed with their <unk> and <unk> in messing with someone who literally has all day to himself 
 now is time to make a real request for everything i can legally ask for 
 this email again explained all of the laws they have violated and requested the full amount due 
 i even calculated the amount they owed me for the late payment 16 days minus the 72 hours rounded down to the nearest $ 5 because i 'm a generous person 
 i had kept every email professional because i know that if this does go to court i can not look like a complete ass i already had walking out on a job going against me 
 again hoping they 'd side with reason i detailed how much extra can be awarded to me up to <unk> the late payment amount plus a total of the state fines 
 their reply this time was simply no '' 
 the court documents were downloaded and filled out the following monday but i was going to give them one last chance 
 another email again detailing the laws and the corresponding sections of their employee handbook citing these laws and how <unk> of the law is no defense but explicit knowledge and failure to follow them would not be in their favor 
 to add a little additional spice i copied the ceo on this email 
 i concluded the email requesting resolution by the end of the week or court documents would be filed 
 an hour later i received a response from hr that their lawyer would contact me by the end of the week 
 by that friday i had a check for the late payment plus a second check for double the amount if i agreed to not take them to court which i did agree to 
 back to what i alluded to in the beginning since this was now reported income for the 2015 year i would need a <unk> from the company in order to file my taxes 
 on the day i received those checks i set a reminder to pursue whatever course i could if they failed to do so 
 my dreams were <unk> when my girlfriend sent me a picture of the envelope last night 
 i even made sure to verify every cent <unk> in <unk> 
 in the end i 'm happy it did n't resort to that 
 i now have a great <unk> path and i do not want to waste anymore time on an old employer 
 **tl dr : op gets new job op leaves new job op <unk> win all the money op wins all the money 
 ** edit : missed words and poor spelling edit 2 : tl dr as <unk> by <unk> because my tl dr would need a tl dr of it 's <unk> first posted this in r/pettyrevenge but it was taken down for not being petty '' enough 
 i thought you guys might like this story of cheaters justice 
 i 'll go ahead and be specific because honestly i do n't give a fuck if she sees this post or not 
 i was on vacation last winter and met a girl at the beach 
 we hit it off she was very attractive <unk> at least 
 she lived by the coast and i lived in central nc about a three hour drive away 
 we begin meeting up regularly going on trips that i always paid for we even went to nyc and when i brought up her paying her share of the hotel costs she said she would pay me back on the next trip '' 
 on that particular trip she brought a friend of hers and that friend 's fiancé and they all seemed pretty distant with me like none of them gave a fuck and they were just three friend 's there having fun while i paid half the bill 
 i know i know i was a dumbass 
 i thought we had a pretty good relationship going 
 after about six months though she starts <unk> out when i want to hang out not returning texts for hours one word answers when she does return them after a while i decided she just did n't want to see me any more and we stopped talking 
 she starting posting pics of her and another guy on facebook referring to him as <unk> '' 
 oh well i thought just another girl hell bent on wasting my time and money 
 a few months later she contacts me though apologizing for how she treated me and how bad she feels about what happened to our relationship 
 she wanted to meet up again and go on another trip with her friends this time to atlanta she wanted to see a <unk> game go to the <unk> etc 
 anyway i told her that i forgave her and i would love to go with her and her friends 
 i had other plans in mind ... she asked about the tickets to the brave game and i told her that if she wanted to go she could just order the tickets online and i could pay her for my ticket later she said that was fine 
 we agreed to meet up in charlotte and they could just park their car there and ride with me to atlanta they never offered to help me with gas money 
 long story short the last snap message i got from her before i blocked her number and blocked her on all social media was a pic of the charlotte <unk> that read almost there '' 
 i read the message from home while drinking a wine cooler and watching a movie 
 the thought of her and her friends driving <unk> around <unk> charlotte looking for me still brings a smile to my face to this day 
 long time lurker first time poster 
 for years my parents used to tell me not to worry about bullies because some day they 'd be working for my interests 
 i grew up being bullied all through grade school by a majority of my peers at a small religious school within the lower <unk> i never had any beef with anyone not even petey the main school bully 
 petey was smaller than i but walked around like he was tough shit when his boys '' were around 
 he liked to <unk> me into responding and when i did his posse would come from nowhere to beat the living crap out of me 
 teachers rarely <unk> in fights and when they did i was in trouble most of the time because you 're the bigger person you should know better '' 
 never figured out how it was my fault that 6 kids decided to kick me black and blue but i was the only one who got a <unk> for it 
 at the end of my last year at this school they had this <unk> party complete with water balloon fight at the end 
 as everyone was drying off after it was over i heard someone yell petey <unk> '' 
 i turned around to see him running at me with his arm <unk> back and throwing it forward towards my back 
 the balloon he held was thrown with a force that knocked my face into the dirt 
 i came to with him kicking me as people were dragging him off me 
 soon after that i was taken out and put into another school where i <unk> beyond <unk> 
 some many years later i was <unk> for jury duty 
 i was one of the lucky cunts out of hundreds picked for such a prestigious honor 
 they 'd tell us before hand the names of the people who would be on trial so we could be excused if we knew them 
 guess who 's name appears old petey 
 and what for 
 the area 's largest <unk> bust in 20 or so years 
 i did n't know this fool anymore 
 i do n't want to say i helped put this sad sack of shit away but i will say i 'll never forget the look on his face when he entered that courtroom in chains and saw me sitting in the front row 
 he 'll be eligible for parole when my kids have <unk> 
 i was told this belongs here ... many years ago around midnight on the eve of my 21st birthday i sat in stunned silence as my ex-girlfriend told me that she had been raped a couple weeks prior at a party 
 as she told the story including the part where her friend was banging on the locked door and screaming trying to get someone to stop it i felt <unk> angry and confused all at the same time in a way i never had before 
 it was truly my introduction to <unk> in a way 
 though she had gone to the hospital had the rape kit done and filed a report charges were never pressed 
 the guy 's fraternity brothers had cornered her afterwards and said that if she tried to go to the police they would all testify that she was lying and use their connections to prevent the case from proceeding one was the son of a state <unk> 
 the da declined to pursue the case mostly because she was too scared to cooperate but also because his family hired a lawyer to <unk> stonewall the process 
 needless to say she was a wreck 
 two days later i visited my college 's counseling center 
 i had found myself so enraged i was actually planning the rapist 's murder in my head and i had even talked to a friend about helping me who then suggested i see a counselor 
 in the months that followed i gradually came to terms with everything and how my anger resulted from things i had witnessed as a volunteer <unk> 
 it was considered a form of ptsd but from an emotional <unk> it was this <unk> realization that life by design is n't as fair as i had been brought up to believe 
 fast forward six years 
 i really had n't kept in touch with my ex-girlfriend very well 
 one day i got a friend <unk> on myspace this was years ago from her and i gladly accepted 
 through the messaging feature we caught up and exchanged phone numbers 
 i learned that she was doing well and she only had a few months more of her residency before she would become a doctor 
 she had also married and was expecting her first of four children 
 a few weeks went by and one night she called me 
 she told me that she had searched for me and <unk> because she had some news 
 seems the rapist had recently been convicted of another rape and she wanted to be there for his <unk> 
 she asked me to go with her as her husband was out of the country her mom could n't go because of her health and she wanted someone there for support and she felt it may give both of us a sense of closure 
 i went with her but we didn’t know there was going to be a hearing first 
 i won’t go into the details but all i can say is that it was really hard to stomach 
 after both sides had people read statements they broke for a brief recess 
 the recess was a lot shorter than i pictured it 
 we came back in and the judge said something about <unk> there is sufficient time to take advantage of the opportunity to rebuild his <unk> then gave him <unk> years which i thought was really odd being so wide and all 
 here comes the revenge : after his lawyer spent what seemed forever arguing that he should be released <unk> appeal denied they <unk> and the <unk> from each side avoided eye contact and did sort of an awkward exit 
 my ex being very pregnant at the time had to stop at the rest room on the way out 
 as i 'm standing there some guy standing near me said bummer huh '' 
 for some mysterious reason i got this weird feeling i should pretend to be on his side and just nod 
 he asked how i knew the defendant and i said i went to college with him 
 when i was asked if i was in his frat i lied and said i was 
 we had a brief conversation and the guy spilled to me that it was likely they were going to send him to a prison that happened to be in the city i lived not sure how he would have known that but like i said the <unk> parents were well connected 
 when my ex came out the guy <unk> us on the baby and before she could correct him i said thank you 
 hey we got ta hit the road 
 ready babe '' 
 she gave me a weird look and said sure 
 let 's go ... 
 babe '' 
 as we got to the car i explained what had happened and thanked her for playing along 
 she knew i was up to something and asked why i was excited that he may be at the prison near me and i said oh it 'll just make me smile when i drive by knowing that he 's getting at least a taste of what he deserved '' 
 but i had something way worse planned 
 you see i was friends with the cos and on a first name basis with the <unk> 
 when i got home i rang up one of the cos and asked if he 'd meet me for a few drinks 
 a couple nights later we sat down and had a few beers and i filled him in 
 i made sure to tell him about the threats his frat brothers had made and insinuated that his family had connections with many <unk> <unk> 
 i also told him the guy was jewish 
 now i may have been <unk> the truth a bit but i knew this co pretty well and there was one thing i always hated about him : he was an <unk> and he hated <unk> because he thought the party was run by sneaky <unk> '' 
 truth be told i have no idea who this rapist and his parents were connected to and i was pretty sure he was n't jewish even though his name suggested as much 
 the co said that he 'd look into it and if it was true he 'd be there he 'd make sure he was given ... the royal treatment '' 
 a little over a year goes by and i totally forget about everything 
 one night i 'm at the bar of our local <unk> and i run into the co who is having drinks with some of his other co <unk> 
 they were absolutely shitfaced 
 he slaps me on the back and says ah thanks for the <unk> '' 
 i did n't know what he meant and he says your slur for jewish people <unk> ... the one that raped your girl 
 oh boy you have no idea how much fun we 've had with him '' 
 basically when he got there they put him in <unk> right away single bed but not the <unk> confinement kind 
 they told him it was for his protection and he thought his parents pulled some strings 
 the real reason they did it is because that 's usually the procedure for <unk> 
 i don’t even want to know how they got the chief officer to approve it 
 when he was brought back to general <unk> they started telling everyone that he was jewish which apparently is a bad thing if you want to <unk> yourself with the white guys 
 in addition to being hated by the other inmates and on one occasion <unk> up a bit in yard time they started banging '' him for even the most minor infractions 
 as a result he started getting <unk> during his constant <unk> which resulted in <unk> <unk> 
 his life was a living hell 
 the cos also got some of the bigger inmates to intimidate him during shower time and they would pretend to walk away for a few minutes to let him get to know his fellow inmate better '' they would never actually let him get raped though 
 if he were to report a rape the responsible co would get in deep shit 
 just to see him sweat 
 i guess that in one short year the guy had pretty much been through hell and the night that they were drinking with me he had been sent to the <unk> for a psychological episode of some sorts 
 earlier that day he had learned from another inmate that all of the infractions on his file made it near impossible for him to get <unk> in his first hearing regardless of how well he did in the years to follow 
 he did n't take it well 
 i know what i did was objectively wrong 
 but it just feels so right 
 when i drove by the prison i would smile and wave 
 recently though i learned he had been transferred at some point 
 i do n't know where 
 but i hope he 's getting the royal treatment there too 
 so this all happened around a year ago 
 i was a senior in highschool and my friend and i were looking for some spare cash to be made naturally so we went <unk> shopping for jobs at our local mall 
 after browsing for any store that was possibly hiring we walk past a pillow kiosk 
 the kiosk donned a now hiring '' sign so my friend and i applied 
 luckily for us the owner was there and hired us on the spot ... red flag 
 he took our names addresses and emails no social security i will get to that later 
 breakdown of the job : stand at the pillow stand approach people and ask them to buy <unk> pillows 
 if we sold x amount of product then we would be able to make commission 
 before i press on i need to say my father has always given me this golden advice always have evidence of your hours '' 
 to which i have taken photos of my punch times for every job i have had 
 right moving on 
 our bosses were two <unk> gentlemen who said we would be paid every wednesday they were personal checks again a red flag 
 i worked there for two weeks without a hitch making commission for nearly every day i worked there 
 third week rolls around and the mall was n't as busy as it was normally possibly <unk> to nice weather and i had no chance of making commission for that day 
 <unk> <unk> i think <unk> 's no big <unk> i think 
 i was wrong ... sort of as it turned out to be a hassle for me financially <unk> for them 
 the day after my missed commission day i get a call while on my lunch hour at school 
 <unk> it 's me bossman i see you did not sell much pillow yesterday and this is being unacceptable 
 i will not be paying you for this week '' 
 but mr. bossman that is illegal 
 you have to pay me for this week '' 
 i can not pay you for this week you not sell many pillow yesterday '' 
 oh man oh man 
 here it comes 
 as an <unk> high school senior i could n't wait for this 
 i knew what was coming as i had documented my hours and everything 
 i show up at the pillow stand after school to confront him and he once again says that he can not pay but this time he said i can not prove my hours see '' 
 he says as he pulls up the now blank punch card 
 oh thats unfortunate but ... 
 see '' 
 as i pull up my phone with all the pictures on it 
 he gets really <unk> and visibly distraught 
 as i have said i can not pay ... '' said mr. bossman do you want me to call the irs 
 i said 
 ah - you do not need to call them why you threaten me 
 i will pay you only because you do threaten me and i feel like <unk> things will be said to the irs 
 said mr. bossman 
 to sum up the next part of the story my friend and i quit that day we got paid in full 3 days early again personal check and oh thats right i called the irs to report tax evasion as the bosses never took taxes out of our checks never took our social 
 we got audited and had to pay roughly $ 50 in back taxes however they were no longer at the mall the following week they had mentioned having a yearly contract that was up in december this was may 
 tl dr : sketchy pillow salesman hires my friend and i tries to not pay me pays me and loses his business and gets in trouble with the irs for tax evasion 
 this story is n't about me but about my mum when she first came to america with my dad 
 backstory : my mum is a native korean 
 she speaks english quite well but being her second language she does have a slight accent 
 my dad is american and english is his native language 
 at the time of this story they were newly <unk> so it was like the early 90 's 
 so they were shopping at some store like a wal-mart or something and my mum needed to find an item so she asked a worker in the aisle if he could help her 
 his response 
 & gt learn to speak english before you talk me 
 well my dad was within <unk> and boy oh boy he was not happy with that comment 
 long story short my dad demanded to see the manager and that guy lost his job right there and then 
 moral of the story : do n't be an racist <unk> all started with trying to find a replacement phone on <unk> classified section of kijiji 
 i was on the hunt for a brand new samsung s5 i ended up finding one fairly <unk> 420 $ and the individual selling it lived 10 minutes away from my house 
 we ended up setting up a meeting and he agreed to sell me his brand new : rogers samsung s5 for 400 $ 
 i’m somewhat tech savvy person and i’m fully aware of all these fake <unk> and blacklisted imei numbers 
 i did my due <unk> and asked him to send me his imei number over text message 
 the imei was clean and everything seemed to be in <unk> i ended up meeting him at <unk> in the west island of <unk> he was about 17 years old had a red t-shirt and came on his yellow bike 
 he seemed like a nice young man and he was very respectful 
 i inspected the phone everything looked new and i verified both imei on the box and the phone they both matched 
 the smartphone even had the rogers <unk> i put my sim card in and everything worked flawlessly 
 i had no doubt that everything about the transaction was <unk> 
 then everything started going downhill from here 
 once i got home i did a factory reset of the phone and got <unk> <unk> message 
 i did some research online and found out that he rooted the phone and replaced the imei on the user interface to match the one on the box 
 he obviously sold me a fake which had no figure print <unk> it didn’t cross my mind to verify that feature 
 the box and accessories were original and the imei on the box was clean but the phone itself wasn’t an original samsung s5 
 i tried contacting the seller the same night but he wasn’t cooperative 
 after a few messages he finally agreed to give me my money back the next morning <unk> at the same location 
 that same night i did some investigation on the individual : he deleted his kijiji ad and he used an online forwarding service for his phone number 
 i started looking in google street view to find the residential areas around where we meet up 
 and this is what i saw 
 the same kid on the bike going into his house 
 busted 
 the next morning i waited for him at the same location to get my money back like we both agreed 
 as i expected it was a no show 
 he ditched last minute and never showed nor did he answer my calls 
 i knocked at the house from street view but no answer i decided to drive around the area trying to spot him or find something that would give me a lead 
 i had no luck and ended up leaving empty handed 
 but i didn’t give up yet 
 fast-forward 1 week it was sunday august 17 2014. i drove around the same area and spotted a car waiting in front of that house 
 i decided to keep my <unk> and keep an eye out 
 15 min goes by and whom do i <unk> <unk> walking towards his house with some grocery bags 
 i quickly get out of my car and confront him 
 he was very surprised to see me but he was very calm 
 i didn’t get physical but i was following him the whole time giving him his options 
 # 1 he gives me my money back and we both go our separate ways or # 2 i call the police and he gets in trouble 
 the scammer didn’t care and he had no intention to give me my money back 
 i followed him into a public bus i guess he thought he could get away and i wasn’t going to follow him anymore 
 so i’m in the bus with this scammer not far from me and the cops are on the way 
 5 minutes into my bus ride a cop van stops the entire bus 
 the cops come in and i <unk> them to the scumbag 
 i ended up getting my money back which was his best option and they arrested him for possession of stolen goods 
 his personal phone he had in his pockets was reported stolen 
 i consider myself lucky of finding this guy thanks to street view 
 be very vigilant out there 
 <unk> : - got scammed a fake phone on kijiji - scumbag playing games with me - i end up finding him on street view - 1 week later i see him on the street - i get my money back - cops arrest him - win i live in michigan where the pot holes are on a whole other level then the rest of the country 
 anyways as i was driving the speed limit taking my grandma to her monthly dr appointment she was fast asleep when all if a sudden this ass hole in a silver <unk> idk what model was right on my ass 
 i brake checked him 2 or 3 times to no avail and decided to let it go when a plan popped into my head that probably wouldnt work 
 i was <unk> with the road and knew there was a pot hole coming up that was the bane to many a car tire and i <unk> a bit just to piss the guy off a bit more and started to pick up speed as i started to draw ever closer to this dead fall in the middle of the road 
 the whole time this little <unk> stuck tight to the ass end of my car had no idea what was coming 
 <unk> to the road gods that it wasnt patched up yet to allow my plan to come to fruition and just when my doubts were about to overcome me the clouds opened up and shown light on the opening <unk> which had grown since the last time i had driven down this road 
 with the <unk> driving skills of jeff <unk> on <unk> i cut over just inches from having been sucked into the <unk> black pit 
 i heard a loud popping then banging sound before i looked back to see the effects of my scheme knowing i had done gods work for the day 
 i looked in my rearview and not only was his tire completly blown out but the rims were completely bent out like the <unk> tires from back to the future 2 when it starts to fly 
 30 minutes later driving back the same way i saw the car still <unk> in the street and <unk> while giving the guy the finger as i drove by it felt good 
 tldr 
 asshole tailgating me fucked his car up on a giant pot hole i <unk> around at the last <unk> we have a portable heater in my <unk> and some of the kids in the neighborhood thought it would be funny to take the portable heater so that the elderly in my house would be aggravated 
 they did n't know that we had some cameras in my house 
 so the kids broke a window to my house stole the portable heater and the elderly in my house were distressed 
 i reviewed the footage and sent it to the police 
 the kids were charged with grand theft portable heater valued at $ 700 / breaking & amp entering 
 one of the kids was an <unk> citizen at his high school and lost his scholarship for college 
 made me feel good that we got the whole thing on tape and he suffered for it 
 all this happened back in the late <unk> <unk> 's 
 i was a cocky <unk> sysadmin contracted out to a large dutch tv production company whose excrement ... .. sorry products '' are sold produced and <unk> <unk> 
 i was stationed at their main <unk> a large studio and office complex where the majority of their dutch language <unk> were recorded 
 and to be honest it was actually great fun to run into tv personalities all day every day 
 most of them were really quite nice in particular to the <unk> who was trying to fix their <unk> 
 of course every now and then you 'd run into someone who was a bit arrogant but i 'd usually manage to get them to drop their attitude by just talking to them like a normal human being 
 dealing with celebs is all in a day 's work under such circumstances 
 and <unk> you 'd usually deal with them indirectly through their production teams 
 i seldom had to deal with the production teams anyway as i primarily dealt with <unk> workstations and servers which never had gave me any real troubles : sometimes the odd <unk> <unk> would pop a <unk> <unk> or i 'd have to <unk> the <unk> on a mail server 
 piece of cake 
 but supporting <unk> was n't why i had been contracted out to begin with - i was a windows <unk> and the company had decided they were going to switch to windows 
 now to phase out <unk> servers and workstations at once was a bit more expensive than the executives were willing to accept so a <unk> had been agreed upon 
 until the last of the recently acquired <unk> reached <unk> they 'd use citrix to load a windows terminal server desktop on each of the <unk> clients 
 seemed like a good idea i guess ... i was contracted to manage the <unk> from <unk> to windows 
 as it turned out there were some troubles with the chosen combination of <unk> terminal server 
 troubles which ended up causing serious troubles on the entire network - the <unk> <unk> itself the moment someone pressed a wrong button 1st gen <unk> were notorious for this printers not working properly and connections dropping due to ethernet broadcast storms 
 there were days where the entire company ground down to a <unk> halt 
 needless to say the employees were less then impressed with all this 
 but i managed to keep their spirits up with my <unk> voice when they called the <unk> : information department this is sebbonl 
 how may i be of service 
 so it was a wednesday morning in september and all hell was breaking loose 
 somebody pressed key a '' instead of b '' or maybe citrix had just crapped itself once more maybe the moon had <unk> in <unk> with <unk> <unk> or maybe the gods were just in a particularly foul mood that day - whatever the reason might 've been the entire network had crapped itself and my co-workers were in the middle of <unk> the entire network 
 servers <unk> switches everything 
 in the meanwhile i was <unk> the <unk> and explaining the situation to our irate <unk> 
 people were upset of course but i calmed them down took their names and numbers and promised i 'd be in touch the moment their department could resume working 
 i also spoke to a girl from a particular production team telling her the <unk> was global and i 'd be in touch the moment we had a resolution 
 her boss cunt '' from here was n't having any of it so he decided he 'd call us himself 
 the conversation went something like this : me : information department this is sebbonl 
 how may i help you '' 
 cunt : are you a fucking retard '' 
 me : excuse me '' 
 cunt : i asked you a simple question 
 are you a fucking retard 
 are you aware that my entire team is currently unable to work '' 
 me : <unk> well ... .. we are aware of the problems they seem to be global however 
 all production teams as well as <unk> and financials are unable to work right now 
 we 're <unk> the best we can actually but it may take about half an hour for the network te become available again '' 
 cunt : that is unacceptable 
 you son of a whore 
 all of you it assholes are incompetent bastards who should be taken out and shot in the back of the neck '' 
 now i am familiar with <unk> and insults but i had never been spoken to in such a manner by a co-worker of sorts 
 so i begun losing my cool somewhat 
 me : sir please refrain from using insults 
 we 're all in this together and this is n't helping 
 if you ... '' cunt <unk> me : what 
 what 
 are you trying to tell me what to do you little fuck 
 i 'll fuck your whore mother 
 clueless <unk> '' 
 at this point i really felt like returning the favour and lay into him 
 however being an external contractor i felt this would 've <unk> a clear <unk> career <unk> action so instead i responded by saying : sir i am no longer willing to continue this conversation in this manner 
 please give me your telephone number and i 'll get my manager to call you '' 
 the cunt proceeded to give me his telephone number an <unk> '' number 
 in the <unk> this <unk> a mobile phone still a relatively new thing at the time 
 but i still had to have a name : me : thank you 
 so who can i tell her she should call '' 
 cunt : & lt b-list celebrity & gt off course '' 
 indeed of course '' 
 like i said most celebs were nice people 
 but as always there must be one exception to the rule 
 cunt turned out to be a b-list <unk> : a middle aged man <unk> known for being an obnoxious asshole 
 this prick started out as a <unk> got a celebrity gossip show on the tv and at the time my story takes place he was <unk> into <unk> <unk> - small time crime mostly 
 he was given a production team a camera crew and sent out to produce his own take on crime stories frequently getting his facts wrong and accusing completely innocent people of crimes they could n't have <unk> 
 other times he 'd get his ass kicked due to him being an insufferable bastard to suspects which is never a good idea 
 but hey the <unk> were good to this day i think because everyone liked seeing him getting beaten up by the <unk> '' he confronted on a daily basis 
 he was known to be a drunk a <unk> and in general one of the most hated people on dutch tv 
 and now it turned out it was n't an act at all : this was just the type of person he was 
 it all made sense to me now ... me saying : ok i will leave a notification on my manager 's desk 
 she will be contacting you shortly 
 but meaning : i am sure she 'll get round to contacting your sorry obnoxious insulting ass and <unk> your trivial shit the moment she 's done <unk> the people who are trying to get the entire goddamn fucking company back up and running '' 
 and hanging up 
 my co-worker a bulgarian guy called <unk> was looking at we funny 
 what the fuck just happened <unk> 
 trust me <unk> you do n't wan na know 
 i think i am taking the rest of the day off 
 and with that i pulled the call logs and forwarded these to my manager together with a report of what had happened & amp request for a call-back and went home 
 the next day business as usual 
 the day after that my manager took me aside <unk> <unk> 
 she had listened to the call contacted the executives and indicated that the cunt should offer apologies for his behaviour 
 the executives had responded by saying that while his behaviour was unacceptable he could n't be forced to offer apologies 
 instead he had promised he would n't contact our department again - sending his requests through an <unk> from now on 
 so tough shit sebbonl 
 just deal with it 
 fuck that 
 no fucking way this prick is getting away with this kind of bullshit 
 so i went online 
 - & gt register new <unk> - & gt new message - & gt to two or three guys i knew who also had a lot of friends 
 hey guys ... you know who i am 
 i 've got a fun message for ya 
 see this telephone number : <unk> 
 dial it right now from a <unk> caller telephone line and see who answers 
 see 
 that 's & lt b-list celebrity & gt who is well known for being an <unk> asshole frequently bothering people for no good reason whatsoever 
 remember the show where he rang the doorbell for 30 minutes at night at a house where three young kids were sleeping 
 do you remember the show where he spent an entire afternoon following and harassing a young mother because her ex 
 <unk> supposedly cheated someone out of a few hundred bucks 
 well let 's see how he likes it 
 feel free to forward this message to as many people as possible '' 
 click send '' 
 log on to the proxy server delete the logs 
 delete the browser cache 
 log on to the router drop the offending records from the logs 
 that 's it 
 i 'd erased my trails to the best of my <unk> and let 's see what happens next 
 three days later i receive a request in my inbox 
 it turns out that somehow <unk> 's mobile number has been made public and he 's being called <unk> times a day 
 could we please arrange for him to receive a new number 
 of course i was forced to update my mass email and <unk> it the moment a new number was assigned making sure to leave a grace period of about a week each time 
 they never found out it was me 
 : edit : typos and <unk> happened back in 2006 but it was such an awesome revenge that i still giggle when i think about it 
 we used to live in a cul-de-sac a street with a dead end with very little traffic 
 despite this one guy decided that he was adamantly against anyone parking their car on the side of the road because he felt that it <unk> the look of the street and was going to lower his property values 
 yeah one of those guys 
 this guy decided that he was going to call a current affair about it - they are a really shitty <unk> tv show '' put in quote marks because they 're so bad that tends to focus on <unk> diets dodgy businesses bad neighbours and things like that 
 here is a link that explains exactly what it 's like 
 they stopped my mum as she was leaving to go to work and asked if they could interview her 
 she agreed but said she wanted to ring our next door neighbour <unk> the bad neighbour lived on the other side of him and harold hated him 
 harold worked locally and quickly drove over so he could be interviewed as well 
 **the revenge : ** harold was a news <unk> for many many years and knew how to control the media knew what to say to turn them against bad neighbour 
 on camera with bad neighbour smugly standing there watching he started destroying this guy 
 claimed that many of the other residents in the street were afraid to leave the house in case this guy came and berated them 
 i ca n't remember exactly what else was said but i do remember that part 
 mum said that she could see the <unk> people 's eyebrows rising as harold went on 
 the next night we watched the show to see what would happen 
 not only did they have footage of the bad neighbour marching down the street set to the <unk> march from star <unk> but they 'd put in all these interviews which they must have gotten afterwards from people at the local council saying how this guy had been harassing them for months and then footage of the guy doing stuff like cutting back someone else 's plants because they were hanging over the <unk> just barely 
 and therefore a violation '' and an interview with him where he said he 'd had to ring several other councils because the local one had stopped taking his calls as well as the police 
 in short they revealed him to be exactly the <unk> he was instead of doing what he 'd hoped portraying him as some kind of <unk> of justice fighting against the evil neighbours 
 bad neighbour ended up complaining to media watch about the whole thing which meant that the episode got aired again ... and finally moved away because everyone was laughing at him so much 
 tl dr : shitty neighbour tries to use the media to get his way <unk> neighbour manages to turn them against him 
 <unk> <unk> from tifu 
 it got removed but i decided to post it here instead since it actually makes me feel better talking about it to people 
 throwaway because i do n't want this <unk> me 
 like most <unk> this did n't happen today 
 it happened back in middle school in the late 90 's 
 it was 5th grade 
 i was a scrawny little nerd i was n't exactly a social person i mostly held to myself playing pokémon in te back corner of the <unk> 
 and since this was a small town in texas i was definitely the weird kid in class and because of this i got bullied 
 a lot 
 most of the glass was apart of the bullying but there was one kid in particular that did most of it 
 i 'll call the kid james 
 because that 's his name 
 james used to push me into lockers call me names and make the whole class laugh at me 
 he was a textbook bully 
 most people would probably maybe tell a teacher parents or maybe they would try to fight back 
 i did n't even think of that though 
 all i could think of was sweet sweet revenge 
 now this could n't just be your everyday put <unk> in the hair revenge 
 no this had to be <unk> pro-revenge 
 i decided to make his family 's already bad financial situation worse by making him get addicted to smoking 
 it would be hard 
 i could n't just go and shove a cigarette into his mouth and hope not to be beaten no 
 i had to <unk> his life and ruin it from within 
 over the next few months i was slowly starting to be nice to him 
 i helped him with his homework shared jokes with him i even gave him some of my precious pokémon cards 
 by 7th grade i had become his best friend 
 had i not had my mind <unk> with hate i 'd see that james was mean because of a lot of things 
 he was insecure his home life awful and above all he had been jealous of me 
 i however did not see this 
 i had <unk> his life and it was now time to destroy it 
 over a few months i started smoking i thought that it was worth it since you had to make some <unk> for revenge 
 and then i offered james some 
 he was reluctant at first but after some <unk> he caved in and tried it 
 much like a drug dealer i gave james his first couple of packs for free 
 but after he had become addicted i told him that he 'd have to get his own 
 james did everything as planned 
 at first he smoked 2 packs a month 
 then it became a pack a week 
 until finally he smoked a pack a day 
 james was addicted for real now 
 my plan had worked <unk> 
 james stole money constantly from his father and he even had to get a job to pay for his addiction 
 james grew anxious and angry every second he did n't light it up 
 i had gotten my revenge 
 but was i happy 
 we were now in grade 10 and i had finally realized what a great person james really was 
 i knew what i had done was horrible so i tried to stop him from his addiction 
 i flushed down his cigarettes i hid them 
 i even took away his money so he could n't buy his death sticks 
 this was all in vain however since he in grade 11 started smoking 2 packs a day 
 during the next 7 years me and james grew closer and closer 
 i was the best man on his wedding and he was at mine 
 hell i even witnessed his sons get born 
 i still could n't forgiven myself how cruel i was when we were kids and i constantly tried to get him to quit the cigarettes 
 think of your kids '' 
 i said do you want to witness them graduate marry and have your <unk> '' 
 this worked 
 james went down from <unk> 2 packs a day to 1 pack a week again 
 it was very hard for him but he made it 
 james was after 9 years completely cigarette free 
 james me and his wife were ecstatic about this 
 i was so proud of him 
 however this happiness did n't last very long 
 james was diagnosed with stage 2 <unk> <unk> cancer 
 the cancer got worse and he died 9 months after the diagnosis 
 it 's now exactly 5 years after his death and his family is still suffering from the consequences 
 i try to help them as much as possible but since i had to quit my job due to depression it 's not a lot i can do financial wise 
 i constantly think about my mistakes 
 how james would be alive right now if it was n't for me 
 how his sons would n't have to grow up without their dad how his wife would n't cry herself to sleep every night 
 james was so much better than me and just because he was mean to me as a kid i had to fucking kill him 
 i constantly think about killing myself 
 but i ca n't 
 his family needs me 
 the family that was robbed from their dad because of me 
 if i killed myself it would make things even worse 
 so to close things up 
 tl dr i killed my best friend because of a petty <unk> i work on trees and sometimes i have to do blocks and blocks of trees near the street when this happens i put up all the correct <unk> which is usually a men in trees '' sign and a few lane closed ahead sign 
 my crew works pretty fast and safe 
 well everyday when we would take lunch we would be sitting under a tree eating our lunch 
 its much faster and efficient for us to just leave the work zone up while we are eating 
 well one day this asshat decided it would be funny to start running over our cones in the <unk> thats the row of cones that starts from the curb and goes at an angle to try to force people into one lane 
 this started on a monday and everyday asshat would come by and run over our cones and laugh at us while we are all sitting down taking lunch 
 so one of us would have to walk a few blocks to go retrieve the cones it basically fucked our lunch and work zone up 
 well come wednesday i had enough i went to my local hardware store and bought a few 80 pound bags of quick-crete and some great stuff '' spray foam i took two of the cones home filled the top two inches of the cones with the foam and went and had a beer while it <unk> 
 then proceeded to mix up the quick-crete into the cones 
 i let it sit overnight 
 the next morning i realized that i mixed it too wet and it would have to dry another day 
 i was kinda upset thinking that i would miss my revenge 
 sure enough asshat came again 
 so friday 
 i take the cones to work and set up the work zone first two cones are normal then the two concrete filled cones 
 lunch time asshat drives by and the whole crew is watching he notices and gets going extra fast knowing that he has our attention 
 first two cones ... then ... first concrete cone dents his bumper pretty good goes under the tire then gets stuck in the wheel well 
 but soon falls out about the time he goes over the second cone hits his car smashes up the bumper and he drives over it 
 he speeds off pretty quick most likely thinking wtf just happened 
 he was in such a hurry he didnt notice his oil pan got ripped off ... enjoy your hopefully '' locked up engine 
 **edit 1 ok first off this was on a low volume street if it wasnt low volume we would have closed the street down completely and <unk> people around its much safer for us 
 yeah i could have gotten shit canned for having the cones like that yeah someone could have gotten hurt but i was much younger and was pissed 
 usually we leave a giant chuck of wood in the work zone to discourage that anymore 
 that being said fuck that guy i used to try to leave nice <unk> for traffic now we just close it off 3 days before and <unk> everyone around and tow any car parked on the street 
 ** for everyone that called bullshit well whatever but i am a very active poster in two tree related subs so you can at least know <unk> this happened several years ago 
 so i 'm not a fan of bathrooms here in the states 
 there is like a foot of clearance between the stall and the floor and an inch on the sides of the door 
 i worked at a target at one point in my life 
 i used to work pretty early in the morning so on my first break id usually drink a huge can of monster energy drink 
 i didnt like the <unk> at my work they were like right next to eachother with no divider 
 so i usually used the stalls to pee 
 well this little brat decided to crawl under my stall 
 kid was like 5 so there is no excuse 
 he crawled under there and turned up to look at me with his mouth wide open 
 i fucked up and <unk> 
 without thinking about it i started peeing on him 
 he sat there for a good minute and a half it seemed then got up and ran out of the bathroom 
 i slipped out behind him while he was talking to his mom outside the bathroom about what happened 
 when she finally did understand what the kid was saying and why he was <unk> wet you could tell she was on the war path and went into the <unk> bathroom on the hunt for the suspected perp 
 needless to say i non <unk> as possible walked away and spent most the rest of the day hiding in the meat cooler 
 serves him right for <unk> under my <unk> wife recently started a job at the check-in desk at a downtown 5 star hotel 
 one of her shift supervisors is a relatively young <unk> guy lets call him douche <unk> dn 
 dn is a typical jersey shore looking wannabe 
 he 's got greasy hair <unk> groomed 3 day growth and <unk> skin 
 the funny thing is he is also <unk> and overweight so the whole look just comes across as sad 
 i 've met him a few times and he is smarmy arrogant and treats his staff like shit 
 anyway from day 1 he started hitting on my wife 
 he initially sent her a text explaining that he lifted her number from the hr file as he was a <unk> leader and wanted to <unk> after his team 
 he texted her pretty much before and after every shift asking her to lunch before hand or drinks afterwards in order to <unk> the <unk> to her 
 these texts later <unk> to telling her to <unk> well and lots so you can be fully refreshed at work explaining that he wanted her looking <unk> like you always do 
 anyway there is tons of this random crap and he is always calling her pet names like 'babe <unk> or <unk> 
 my wife tried to keep it professional in her replies but it was quite clear this dn was n't going to stop 
 she also always <unk> both her engagement ring and wedding band so there is no excuse 
 to put this story into context i am a current serving army officer 
 as a <unk> commander who has led soldiers in afghanistan i would say that i know a thing or two about leadership 
 so he 's claim that he was just being a <unk> leader just seemed pathetic 
 i wanted to straight out punch this dude in the face <unk> style but my wife calmed me down as she did n't want to start trouble at her new job and as a supervisor dn could technically assign her the crappy shifts 
 two weeks ago my wife asked me to go pick her up from work that way she could introduce me to dn and rest of the desk <unk> as her husband 
 i went straight after my work so i was in full uniform and arrived about 10 mins before her shift ended 
 i walked straight up to him and introduced myself to dn 
 i <unk> a foot above him and gave him my hardest bone <unk> handshake 
 my voice was friendly but my eyes were like a <unk> <unk> dn my wife told me all about you 
 she is saying how you are a great leader and always looks after her team 
 he <unk> <unk> something about being busy and walked way 
 i stared at him all the way as he exited the room my wife and the rest of her team all burst out laughing 
 pathetic 
 a few days after this incident my wife gets an email from dn with upper management cc 'd 
 dn works with her everyday so the only reason why he would send her an email in <unk> of just telling her would be because he wanted her to get into trouble from the bosses 
 the email explained that employees are forbidden from having personal visits during work hours as it might reflect badly on the hotel 
 if she was to have someone pick her up that i should wait in the loading area at the back of the hotel 
 what the fuck 
 i was super pissed now 
 again the wife calmed me down and told me to forget it i love her but she can be <unk> professional sometimes 
 so i sat down and plotted revenge with my 4 of my army mates during our weekly drinking session 
 we decided that the revenge should be subtle and not traceable to me this rules out physically harming him 
 we then came up with a series of events that would screw with him a period of 4 days 
 mind you i did this all while keeping my wife out of it she would not approve 
 1. my mates and i went to a internet cafe and spent three hours signing up his work email address to all number of <unk> websites from all corners of the internet 
 from gay dating to <unk> appreciation anything and everything 
 somethings we say i will never be able to erase from my memory the raw internet is a horrible place children 
 2. we <unk> him from when left work and <unk> him to his house it was n't hard as we had his shifts courtesy of my wife 
 after <unk> his address we waited till dead in the middle of the night sneaked into yard jacked his car up and placed all four tyres up a tree he had in his front yard 
 let him puzzle that one out 
 3. finally my friends and i called hotel management independently six times at varying intervals pretended we were guests and complained that we saw dn behind the counter looking at inappropriate stuff on the internet 
 i feigned disinterest when my wife came home <unk> telling me that dn was late for work as someone had removed his tyres and that management had come to ask him a few questions but seized his computer instead when he was n't there and were going through his emails 
 a few days later dn had being demoted and moved to a different location across town 3 star motel owned by the same <unk> 
 i 've never told my wife my involvement 
 tldr : fuck with an army officer 's wife get demoted and moved across town 
 edit : corrected for grammar and spelling 
 this is a story that happened on my drive home about half an hour ago 
 the smell of justice still hangs in the air 
 i 'm driving down this quiet <unk> residential street 
 playground zone but it 's <unk> so i 'm doing 5 over the speed limit of 40 <unk> 
 all of a sudden some <unk> comes flying down the road behind me stopping mere inches from my bumper 
 i mean i could n't even see his headlights anymore and i drive a smallish car 
 i just wanted to get home not into an accident so i moved over into the parking lane '' 
 there 's not two lanes there but at this time of night there was nobody else on the road and i was driving in the gravel at the side of the road 
 this guy had more than ample room to pass me if he wanted 
 \ & gt <unk> this <unk> of driving etiquette follows me over still so close that i ca n't see his headlights 
 well shit 
 what now 
 i keep rolling along and see my <unk> in the distance : the <unk> most useless piece of <unk> i 've ever laid eyes on 
 - actual picture i keep driving along towards this thing drawing ever <unk> 
 my <unk> are getting sweaty 
 my eyes are <unk> back and forth from the <unk> and my rearview mirror 
 i have a very small window 
 all my training my years of experience have led me to this moment 
 i either go home a hero or not at all 
 i wait till the last possible second and swerve back into the lane proper 
 <unk> mcgee back there just did n't have the time to react 
 what followed was possibly the most satisfying series of sounds i 'll ever hear 
 i watched in my mirror as his front end hit the curb at <unk> his bumper was immediately ripped off do n't lower your rides kids 
 his car jumped up onto the curb and <unk> the unsuspecting sign as a <unk> would swallow a fish 
 a final glance back as i turned the corner a few hundred meters ahead rewarded me with the glorious sight of smoke pouring out from under his hood 
 \ & gt <unk> this story is a from almost 2 years back but i just found this subreddit and thought it would be a good story 
 with video also note this story uses <unk> because this is in colombia 
 it was <unk> 2011 and i was driving my nissan in a quiet residential area 
 i approached an intersection that was rather notorious for people disregarding the stop sign 
 i have the right of way as streets going either north or south usually do 
 i was going <unk> and i look right as i 'm about to cross the intersection and i see a big mercedes suv <unk> ass just meters away from the intersection easily <unk> 
 i see a cellphone by her ear 
 she sees my car and brakes to around <unk> 
 crash 
 my car even hit the sidewalk with enough force to lift the entire right side away from the ground 
 i am shocked and a little bruised and literally crying 10 seconds after the crash i love my car 
 she drives away 10 seconds later 
 as a first but small victory for me a cab driver that saw the crash can be seen on the far right edge after the crash turns around and chases her and brings her back 
 my family and some friends arrive to help me uncles are lawyers while the cop and the respective insurance lawyers sort everything out 
 this lady driving the mercedes and her husband threaten us you 're going to be screwed out of insurance '' watch your bank accounts '' etc 
 the traffic cop was bribed by them we saw her husband giving him money and drew the accident 's sketch incorrectly 
 my uncles <unk> proceed to point out this error 
 sketch is corrected and they did n't like that we noticed second victory 
 cop asks both parties to sign off the report i do n't sign it you 'll know why 
 we leave 
 my car was towed as it was <unk> and her car was never even present at the scene of the accident after the accident itself 
 fast forward two days later a friend suggests you know the building in front of where you crashed has to have surveillance footage ... '' bingo third victory 
 we go ask get the video and take it to her insurance and our insurance company 
 now the reason i did n't sign the accident report was because in her statement she claimed i was speeding going the wrong way and that i attacked her car 
 lying to the insurance company is grounds for cancellation 
 on top of that my dad found out both the cars they had the mercedes and a bmw are <unk> 
 my dad is friends with the owner of the lease company 
 he handed over everything 
 a week later we get the call that they took both cars back cause they were used 
 fourth victory a month after the accident i get my car back as good as new 
 the cost of repair was greater than the value of the car 
 biggest victory 
 but it was fixed because my dad is also friends with the owner of nissan in colombia 
 he told the insurance company friends as well do n't let this car get totalled he loves this car '' 
 and that is how i got my great revenge on the person who i hate most in this life 
 the video if anyone wants to watch it is here accident at 0:30 ps : we also investigated them 
 got their address names kids names where they go to school what they do for a living everything 
 long story short they have stolen a lot of money from the state thanks to shady businesses they run 
 edit : the reason i refused to let my car go was because at the time it was a 14 year old 1997 nissan <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 i <unk> the car from my grandfather and i love it to <unk> my grandpa had a long going <unk> with his older brother 
 for some context his older brother <unk> their mother from her nursing home hid her in florida and had her change her will to only include him to the <unk> of her three other children 
 first my grandpa 's brother took control of the house my grandparents lived in that was his parents and the business they had <unk> for 15 years their business on land owned by his parents 
 my grandpa offered to buy the property from his brother but got the response i 'll sell it to you over my dead body '' 
 grandpas brother showed up with a cooler and lawn chair to watch as they were forced to move out 
 so my grandpa got a friend of his jim to buy the property 
 after the sale went through grandpa 's brother handed jim the keys ... and jim <unk> to my grandpa who was hiding around the corner to come and get the keys 
 grandpas brother was furious 
 many years later my grandpa is driving around with his son in law my dad when he runs over a skunk 
 he comes up with a great plan heads home and ties a milk crate to his bumper 
 grandpa puts the skunk in the crate goes home and <unk> his wife goodbye and tells her i 'll be back in a few days '' 
 he made a 24 hour drive to florida dumped the skunk in his brothers convertible and makes the drive home 
 when my grandpa died he had a newspaper clipping in his wallet <unk> phony bomb <unk> '' 
 apparently someone '' while on vacation in florida strapped some <unk> <unk> to an alarm clock and tossed it under grandpas brothers trailer 
 just to start off i suck at telling stories and i just want to tell this story while it 's fresh in my mind 
 when my dad was still in the military he was in charge of a group of soldiers 
 one of them was a female who he said probably had mental issues 
 he has no idea how she even got in but she did 
 this female soldier befriended another soldier 
 because of her issues she trusted him without question very <unk> eventually she trusted him to drive her car and get some money out of the atm for her 
 this little shit took her car completely emptied her account and then went <unk> 
 now this girl was about to leave the army due to her issues and that money was all she had to help her once she was out so she was devastated 
 they eventually found the guy and he was brought before my dad since my dad was his superior officer 
 now i 'm not entirely sure why but they would n't just straight up arrest him and send him to fill sandbags in the texas heat at the base 's jail 
 my dad said something about the legal process takes awhile for a chapter 10 or something like that 
 in other words the civilian police could n't arrest him since he was under military jurisdiction and the military could n't do anything because it was being investigated or processed 
 so anyway my dad could n't find a way to send him to the jail and this guy is all cocky like “i do n't regret it one bit she 's just stupid for letting me have access 
 not my fault she 's stupid 
 etc <unk> 
 my dad was looking for any way to punish this guy until he found out the most borderline illegal thing he could 
 he ended up going to the guy still sitting there with this smirk on his face and my dad said “well since you do n't show any <unk> and i ca n't send you to fill up sandbags here what you 're gon na do 
 i got a job for you your job is to sit in this tiny room and make sure the paint does n't <unk> no one could talk to him he would leave to eat he ate in an isolated room facing the corner and to go the bathroom 
 that was it 
 also my dad was only required to give him 4 hours of sleep 
 so he could leave the room at midnight and at 4 in the morning he was woken up to make sure that paint did n't peel 
 my dad even decided to have some fun with him 
 one day he went in and said “i feel like being nice today i 'm gon na let you read today 's <unk> 
 the guy was overjoyed at the prospect of getting to read the newspaper all he had done was stare at a wall and did n't even know what was going on in the outside world 
 right as he started to read my dad took it away immediately and said <unk> never mind you 're stupid 
 ca n't believe you trusted <unk> then left again 
 after a few days the guy could n't take it 
 he called his attorney and begged for him to find a way to send him to the base 's jail so he could fill sandbags instead of staring at a wall making sure the paint does n't peel 
 but attorney could n't find a way to make it happen 
 eventually they were able to discharge him from the army 
 my dad 's 2nd in command had to escort him to the front gate to officially release him 
 what the jackass did n't know was the civilian police were finally able to get a warrant for his arrest for stealing that poor girls money 
 so the whole drive this cocky guy is like “yup soon i 'll be out and i can tell you how i feel about you yadda <unk> and the 2nd in command is like “yup you can say <unk> you <unk> 
 when they got to the gate they released him and the 2nd in command is like “well you 're out of the army now you can say whatever you <unk> 
 the jackass opens his mouth to speak but the 2nd in command goes <unk> just one more thing gentleman this is the <unk> and the two civilian cops who had been waiting out front immediately put him in cuffs 
 my dad 's 2nd in command leaned in to the guys face and said <unk> a nice fuckin day.” then laughed his ass off 
 tl dr : soldier steals another soldiers life savings my dad makes him sit in a room making sure the paint does n't peel until he can be discharged and arrested by civilian police 
 like i said i really suck at telling stories and remembering details 
 i do n't even remember what i had for breakfast yesterday 
 if you need anything clarified leave it in the comments and i 'll go ask my dad 
 i think that would be better than making him <unk> the entire story to me while i <unk> wife works for a national chain of home improvement stores and brings her lunch with her to work daily including <unk> water to drink while she eats 
 when she gets to work she <unk> all the <unk> in the <unk> in the break room 
 we live down south usa and last july was extremely hot 
 i 'm talking over 100 degrees <unk> for 3 days in a row my wife 's water bottles were just disappearing between the time she got to work and meal time 
 obviously someone other then my wife love you sweetheart thought they were too good to drink from the water fountain 
 i can only assume it was someone working the <unk> garden center that was extremely thirsty and could n't resist the cold water 
 after the second day i recommended a revenge plan which my wife shot down due to it possibly putting her job in <unk> 
 after the third day she agreed 
 i looked up a video on youtube on how to open water bottles without breaking the <unk> 
 for those who are interested : anyway the plan was to refill the water bottles with vinegar 
 i filled 2 water bottles with vinegar and left 1 alone 
 i put a little mark on the water bottle so she would know which one was still good to drink 
 she went to work and set the trap 
 when she came back into the break room for lunch one of the vinegar bottles was gone from the <unk> 
 on the other side of the room there was a liquid all over the <unk> like someone had walked into the break room all hot and sweaty saw the magical chilled <unk> that always appeared and chugged and <unk> vinegar 
 while we never did find out who was stealing the water it has n't happened since and just imagining what i just described above has been very satisfying for me 
 <unk> 
 edit : thanks for all the replies 
 some users are calling it fake or posted in the wrong sub 
 not fake 
 i found this sub yesterday and decided to post a time i got revenge 
 figured i 'd share my idea of a good laugh : i 'm from london and take <unk> and trains nearly everywhere 
 i had some driving lessons when i turned 17 but i never passed my heart was n't in it so while i can drive i am not a licensed driver 
 this particular bus i 'm on heading west is headed for <unk> and is a very long single <unk> 
 there 's a point on the route where a brick wall <unk> a very tight curve the bus needs to edge through there and nearly everyone knows the spot is tricky and give some space to the many bus routes that come through here 
 this airport <unk> is so long it need to be extra careful and i always <unk> the drivers who make it look <unk> 
 about <unk> or 5 miles <unk> i 've <unk> at my stop and am a few steps away when i hear commotion 
 a woman has pulled up on the driver 's side of the bus at a 45 degree angle to block the bus 
 i drew it - remember we drive on the left here he needs to pull out to the right 
 total grade a dick move 
 she is screaming at the driver that he cut her up '' back at the dodgy walled corner 
 she 's demanding his driver id and plate which she could take herself because its there for anyone to see 
 the driver did n't cut her up she likely just did n't have patience and got pissed while he took the corner 
 he 's rightfully refusing to give her the time of day and quite politely insists she stop blocking the bus there 's about 30 people on board with places to go 
 some passengers are telling her she 's being outrageous as well 
 i have ceased walking and remain because i 'm not afraid of pushy selfish people 
 she did n't even shut her driver side door or take her keys with her so i get in and drive ahead a bit it 's now parked at the end of the bus stop so it 's not blocking the bus nor any traffic 
 i get out and see the bus driver shout cheers mate '' and he all but <unk> her as he swiftly takes off to continue his route 
 now that she ca n't berate him she tries to get in my face but i 'm much taller than her anyway and put headphones on and continue walking 
 better still my walk takes me onto a road which you ca n't enter by car from her way it 's one way slip onto her road so she could n't follow me even if she had the balls she wants everyone to think she 's got 
 if she was clever she 'd have taken his plate herself but she missed her chance and will now never be able to report her <unk> to the bus company 
 **tl dr** a <unk> blocked a bus that i just <unk> from so that she could shout at the driver but let her door open and engine running so i moved it for her and the bus and my fellow passengers could get on <unk> way edited a word edit 2 : <unk> i went to bed and this got popular 
 and for science 
 <unk> / <unk> of the dodgy walled <unk> fun story for you all 
 when i was young highschool age i lived with my family in a <unk> class suburb 
 everybody in the community got along and for the most part life there was quiet peaceful and enjoyable 
 that is of course for one major exception of the house next to mine which was rented by mr public nuisance $ pn 
 be it <unk> fueled parties drug busts and constant eviction notices there was rarely more than a week that went by without some sort of police involvement 
 to put $ pn into perspective he would have failed to get a job being a <unk> simply because he was <unk> 
 one fateful night however the neighborhood got even 
 it was about 11pm on a spring night 
 myself and family are attempting to sleep however the party bumping from the other side of the fence is making sleep or even clear thought all but impossible 
 police had already been called <unk> had been turned down then turned back up again as soon as the police car had pulled around the corner 
 i crawled out of bed and made my way out to the living room 
 the front door was open and my father was standing out front in conference with the neighborhood pajama committee 
 they <unk> and my father came back inside 
 i asked him what was happening 
 & gt '' just be quiet and follow me '' 
 i followed my father out of the house into the back yard where he opened up the valves for our <unk> they <unk> under the pressure 
 he handed me one of the <unk> and whispered on my command '' we both walked over to the fence and took aim 
 my father waited checking his watch until finally his arm dropped 
 <unk> of water appeared from all around and <unk> into $ pn 's yard 
 sounds of drunken partying turned to screams of shock 
 now would probably be a good time to note that the neighborhood water supply was winter <unk> which usually sat just above freezing <unk> 
 in the cool spring air it was probably quite uncomfortable 
 screams of shock were eventually <unk> by a yell of rage 
 $ pn had lost it and was screaming half slurred expletives 
 we shut the water off and somebody yelled back sorry thought it was the dog '' 
 a few minutes later the neighborhood pajama committee had <unk> and were giggling among each other 
 $ pn was standing in the nude in front of his house continuing a to yell at the top of his lungs 
 at that moment a police car pulled around the corner 
 long story short $ pn was taken to jail on charges of providing alcohol to minors <unk> exposure <unk> acts with a girl under the age of 18 and a slew of other <unk> charges 
 he plead guilty to many of the charges and <unk> <unk> however because he now had a record of sexual assault he was forced to move away from our community and the many schools that were <unk> i was 7 or 8 i cant <unk> it was 20 years ago i set up a lemonade stand a quarter for a cup in my drive way with my friend and neighbor <unk> at the time 
 anyways there was a 10 year old bastard name tim who kept coming over taking the pitcher drinking from it and then dumping what was left in the grass called us names like penis <unk> and fart <unk> or some such 
 he did this 3 days in a row 
 well on the 4th day my mom had chicken <unk> out in the sink in some water and i always remember her saying if you touch the water wash your hands or <unk> get sick 
 so i got my pitcher and filled it with the chicken water 
 so this young hitler douchebag comes over not 10 minutes after we had made the lemonade and he does his thing 
 anyways a few days later hes taken in to the hospital with severe food poisoning caused by me and hes there for a week 
 thats my revenge <unk> is a tale i 've told plenty of people before but never had the chance to share it on reddit 
 when i was in middle school there was a guy named joshua who was a real prick 
 he and his two cronies would go around in stereotypical fashion and pick on anyone who was dorky different looking poor <unk> cetera 
 unfortunately as a white nerd in flushing ny with a single mother i fit all the requirements 
 now lunch money was n't really that <unk> most people were either on an official lunch plan or brown bagged it on the daily i was the latter 
 and so joshua proceeded to steal my lunch from me day after day after day 
 of course being <unk> little <unk> a <unk> youth i went and told the teachers 
 but i was always met with answers like just sit somewhere else '' really 
 he comes to *me* lady tell him it 's not his lunch '' <unk> what a novel <unk> 
 or my personal favorite his friends said that you gave your food to him '' 
 now at this particular middle school wite-out '' was banned apparently because some kids had been found <unk> it behind the <unk> we 're talking about <unk> year olds in this school people 
 it was this that gave me my perfect idea 
 the next day i had graham crackers in my lunch 
 before the period started i brought my lunch into the bathroom along with a <unk> bottle of wite-out i 'd swiped from my mother 's desk 
 i took the little brush and liberally applied the <unk> chemical to the graham crackers 
 i 'd like to pause for a moment and say that i imagined in my <unk> 11-year-old mind that he would see the graham crackers <unk> with white and reeking of wite-out and say darn 
 i ca n't eat this 
 my master plan <unk> '' 
 or something of the sort 
 needless to say little joshua stole my lunch again that day 
 i chuckled to myself thinking of how he 'd curse my name when he discovered the best part of the lunch had been made <unk> 
 later that day i was called into the assistant principal 's office 
 apparently little joshua had left class with a <unk> and was currently <unk> route to the hospital getting his stomach pumped 
 long story short i got five days <unk> suspension joshua missed school for a week and he never went after my lunch again 
 oh and the best part : *he thought it was icing 
 *i worked as a security guard downtown in a large canadian city 
 this story starts when i got a phone call from one of the other guards working 
 he found a contractor had parked and left a truck in a loading dock bay and was inquiring if i knew anything about it 
 the site i worked at had 2 buildings over 60 floors between them and that shared a loading dock with only 3 spaces 
 occasionally on an expected slower day contractors could ask us to leave a vehicle there if they were doing a quick job but it was <unk> as the the loading dock was really busy 
 around this time there was a company who had just rented 2 or 3 floors and there was a massive remodel going on there 
 people were in and out constantly and the job was going to run for a few months 
 this made the loading dock <unk> busy enough that we were n't letting anyone park there just unload 
 i had been there that day and no one had asked permission to park and nothing had been passed on from other guards or property management 
 i told the guard as much and he went to find the contractor to have the vehicle moved 
 about half an hour later as i am <unk> i hear my guard arguing with someone near the building control center 
 as i approached i picked up this was an argument about the truck 
 the contractor was saying that they had been given permission to park there 
 i walked up and explained that there were only 2 people on site that day that could have given permission i was one of them and worked with the other for half the day and we did n't give anyone permission to park there 
 he needed to move the vehicle 
 the contractor left at that point and i thought the issue was settled 
 about 15 minutes later i was covering a break in the control room when the foreman of the contract company who is also the owner of the truck approached and told me that they had been promised parking and are n't going to move the truck 
 i again politely explained to him that he did n't have permission and that the truck needed to move as we needed the loading dock space 
 he then proceeded to yell at me call me worthless explained how he was so much more important than i was how he made my yearly salary in a month and most importantly he was n't moving the truck and he would get me fired if i kept harassing '' him 
 as i started to respond he just turned and walked away as he was too busy to bother with me 
 i was furious 
 it 's bad enough to be a <unk> asshole but to also threaten my job was too far 
 i followed after them and asked them really quickly what company they were with got the company name and left them alone 
 i went back to the control center and called the company 
 i explained who i was that the truck was illegally parked that the contractor threatened to have me fired for asking him to move the truck and that he refused to speak with me about the issue as he was worth too much to bother with a lowly security guard 
 we spoke for a few minutes as she apologized and asked me what i wanted to happen 
 i just asked that the contractor be spoken with as that level of disrespect is unacceptable and lastly the truck had to be moved 
 pretty quickly the truck was moved and the night supervisor for the 3 floor build came and apologized 
 the contractors were friends of his he had given them permission to park there as they were helping out for the next few weeks on the job 
 he paid to park the truck himself and it cost over $ 150 to park just for the night in the closest lot 
 he did n't come across as actually apologetic at all more a guy doing damage control for his friends 
 this is where the revenge gets pro $ 150 in parking is petty at best 
 the next day i ran into one of the contractors i was on great terms with 
 we would often talk for a while when we could 
 he explained that he was the lead for the entire build on the project which i hadnt realized previously 
 i thought he was just one of the regular guys 
 he spoke with the night supervisor and heard about the issue <unk> out the night supervisor for handling the situation so poorly fired the <unk> from the job and blacklisted them from ever doing business with them again 
 the main contractor company was a huge company that is constantly doing work with the property management company who own around a third of all the major buildings in that city and similar amounts in most of the other big canadian cities 
 not a company you want a bad reputation with 
 had a neighbor many years ago with a pack of <unk> that they did n't take care of much other than to feed them 
 <unk> little fuckers would crap all over my yard and run over <unk> and growling snapping at your heels just trying to get in the door from the car 
 they 'd run up the steps and try to follow you in going ape shit the whole time 
 i knew the neighbors knew because i saw them watching with smirks 
 tried to kick the little shit bombs but they stayed just out of range 
 animal control did jack <unk> about it 
 finally i took a shovel and started flicking all of the dog poop onto their roof 
 after several weeks of it building up it rained 
 the literal shit storm that ensued was like rotten <unk> train pouring over the sides 
 the dad was cussing and yelling trying to dodge his family onto the porch out of the <unk> rain when they got home 
 much glee was had 
 the dogs stayed in their back yard after 
 tl dr : neighbors house rained dog shit upon them 
 this occurred in my second year of university i opted to live in the dorm again in an apartment style dorm room 
 i had three roommates : apple orange and melon 
 * <unk> apple was clever 
 she refused to stop smoking weed but knew the university had a heavy fine for being caught smoking legal or illegal so she mainly squatted at her dealer 's apartment and i had no problem with that 
 * <unk> she was from a very small town was easily intimidated and simply wanted to be left alone 
 we get alone just fine 
 * <unk> melon was the problem 
 when you applied to the dorms you checked off what you liked and disliked in terms of noise <unk> habits and guests 
 apple orange and i all wanted quiet no guests and we all took school very seriously 
 melon wrote the same thing on her application but that was a lie 
 she wanted to party and she wanted to party hard 
 it started with her leaving her room for days at a time and not turning off her laptop which played an <unk> muslim call to <unk> 5 times a day and had to be shut off manually 
 at first it was n't <unk> everyone makes mistakes and a quick call to the ra and she came down keys in hand and turned it off 
 but it began happening 5 days a week and finally i complained that this was driving me insane 
 melon was given orders to fix the problem she turned the function off 
 <unk> : there were 2 bathrooms to a dorm room and apple and i shared so i basically had my own bathroom and orange and melon shared 
 orange tried once to ask melon to clean the bathroom and melon snapped and began screaming at her threatening her and this began the bullying i did n't learn about this for months 
 revenge the first : i walked into the dorm room and smelled pot 
 i checked apple 's room since she openly admitted to smoking and she was squatting still 
 orange was n't in and that left one person 
 i put my ear to the door and heard a large group of people and turns out melon decided to have a <unk> party fully knowing that the 4 of us agreed to have no smoking at all 
 the fine was huge and i hate the smell of any smoke 
 i casually walked down to the ra 's room and told her i smelled smoke from melon 's room and i had some papers ra needed to sign anyway so why not come to my room and sign the papers 
 ra comes smells smoke opens door and finds the smoking and melon is busted with a 600 $ fine 
 revenge the second : melon liked friends and she liked having her friends over 
 but never at reasonable times she would invite her friends over at 3-4am during midterms finals and they 'd be loud 
 i got sick of this immediately and i tried asking melon to have people over when her roommates were n't sleeping 
 she told me to go fuck myself '' and if i was n't having people over at 3-4am i must have no friends 
 not sure about that logic 
 so after she invited a bunch of guys over who began yelling to each other about what food to order i got my revenge 
 she left her <unk> on the table and these cards had to be swiped to get into the building and your personal room 
 the first time i simply <unk> the card and the second time i threw the card away 
 a replacement card cost 40 $ this was n't working so i came up with a better plan : i <unk> the new card so when she tried to come into the dorm room at 3am with a bunch of drunk assholes the card did n't work and she began banging on the door and rattling the <unk> 
 this time i called the ra and security and said i thought someone was breaking in 
 caught with a bunch of <unk> that early and with that level of noise cost her 150 $ in fines 
 revenge the third : no animals were allowed in the dorm 
 i was hearing scratching noises and i was worried about mice or rats melon was filthy in terms of food disposal and storage and i knew she was n't home but she 'd propped her door open 
 i poked my head in and lo and behold there is a <unk> of some sort <unk> or <unk> in a massive cage 
 i got pissed off because there carpet had urine and <unk> on it and i 'm fairly sure that urine and <unk> matter probably could carry some sort of disease 
 i closed the door and called ra and said there was a scratching in our room and i was worried about <unk> 
 ra came and opened apple 's door finding nothing 
 my room had nothing and orange 's room had nothing 
 but melon had a <unk> 
 that was a 500 $ fine for the animal and something else for carpet cleaning 
 i think melon began to get suspicious of me i always made sure that it was other people <unk> her and i always planned things well 
 if she did she never tried anything 
 but i was unaware that melon was taking her anger out on orange 
 i liked orange a lot she was sweet shy and could not be mean if she tried 
 i was writing an essay once and i heard noise that was louder than my headphones and i slid them off and heard melon screaming and threatening orange 
 i opened my door and saw orange in the corner crying and trying to ball up and melon was standing over her just shrieking i called the ra for non nefarious purposes 
 and grabbed orange and let the ra restrain melon 
 this time a big meeting was called and orange spilled everything : melon was stealing toiletries from her eating orange 's food etc etc 
 the rules were set : * no guests in the room from 9pm to 9am melon was furious * melon had to pay orange for the toiletries and food * melon was told that one more <unk> out of line would <unk> a massive fine * we were all told to basically stay away from each other * when final exam time came no guests period 
 for anyone 
 i felt really guilty that i never knew what orange was going through i apologized a lot and i kept watch 
 my last revenge : at this point we were getting close to the end of the school year and melon 's parents were calling a lot and were furious at the amount of money she had accrued in fines 
 and i really thought she was going to stop being such an asshole but i was wrong 
 melon decided to blow off some of her final exams genius 
 and have a bunch of friends come over 
 they came over at 4am and tried to have a <unk> party 
 i woke up because i heard glass breaking on the floor and vodka began <unk> under my door 
 i had an exam in the afternoon 
 i did not need this shit 
 melon knocked on my door and i feigned sleep and when i heard her say do n't worry she 's not home '' i called the ra and let the hammer fall 
 her parents were called and they apologized to orange and i and i 'm not sure what the final fine was 
 she had planned to spend her third year of university in the dorms again but the ra was so frustrated with her asshole behaviour she wrote a letter to the head of the board and said that letting her back into the dorms would be a huge mistake 
 the last time i saw her her parents were loading her shit into a van and she waved at me and it hit me 
 i do n't think she really knew it was me 
 the whole year every time she got busted every fine was because of me 
 there is something very pleasurable about anonymous revenge i 'm not sure how to explain it 
 tl dr : over the span of one year i made sure that my roommate was fined for every asshole thing she did 
 she does not know it was <unk> story is a little old taking place around 2000 or so 
 anyways during that summer there was a rash of punks who would go and <unk> houses cars and pretty much anything else they could do to raise hell 
 it was so bad that they would keep stealing the hub caps off of my fathers grand national as well as try and get in to steal the radios and change 
 he was forced to keep it unlocked as it was cheaper then them breaking the windows 
 the police would always take their sweet time getting here 
 it would take 20 minutes or more to send one officer here even though i could walk to the station in that amount of time 
 by then they kids would have run off and gotten away 
 my father is an engineer by trade and decided to get back at them as right after he replaced the hub caps they would be there that night to take them 
 my father went to the hardware store and bought some wires razor blades and grabbed a few car batteries he had in the garage 
 what he did was truly diabolical 
 he took a little glue and on the inside of the door handles <unk> secured razor blades to cut anyone who <unk> to open the door 
 next he stripped some of the wires he got and wrapped them around the hub caps making sure they were pressed tight against them 
 he took <unk> wire and used a little tape and glue to have the wire hovering over the wires so that if someone were to grab them it would complete the circuit and either burn or shock them 
 eventually he was able to get them all rigged before running the wire ends back to the batteries 
 he connected them and then went inside 
 that night my father left the windows open slightly so he could listen for them 
 sure enough sometime after midnight those little <unk> came back 
 but after a few yells they seemed to leave rather quickly 
 the morning <unk> a fair amount of blood around the handle which then <unk> down the drive way 
 one of the <unk> melted slightly from the heat of the wire but the others were not triggered 
 needless to say they didnt seem to come back after that one 
 i just wish we had a security system that also had a camera so i could watch those morons get <unk> this happened about 10 years ago 
 i used to work for a technology company in a government <unk> 
 it was a building that helped start up companies by offering very cheap rent 
 one of the companies was an <unk> company 
 the owner was a complete douchebag 
 whenever you would run into him he was always a complete dick 
 anyone that knew him hated him 
 it was a small company only 4-5 staff members for the first couple of months 
 honestly i do n't even know how he survived that long 
 the animators were terrible 
 and by terrible i mean what the fuck did i just watch '' terrible 
 but this guy was an amazing salesman 
 he managed to sell himself and his company to a hip hop group in california 
 being from a fairly small city in canada <unk> this was a big deal 
 it made the business sections in the newspapers and he even won an award for top 50 ceo 's in the region 
 the new contract landed him millions of dollars with around <unk> million upfront 
 but he did n't have enough staff to take on this new <unk> mini series 
 he immediately hired approx 20 additional animators 
 all naive students right out of college 
 after a couple of weeks his new staff still was n't being paid 
 i knew a couple of people that worked there including one of the original 5 who was receiving a small paycheck and asked her what was the deal 
 she told me that he said he did n't have any money and that the money was coming soon '' 
 he somehow convinced most of the animators to continue working for free 
 he insisted that if they stuck around they would all become rich and it would make all their personal <unk> look amazing 
 considering most of these kids had no experience they did n't quit 
 once i found out about his claim of having no money i contacted a local magazine 
 it 's a political magazine that likes to report on businesses and <unk> that are corrupt 
 they emailed me back and i told them everything i knew about this <unk> company and what the owner was doing 
 well the magazine did some digging and published an article about the owner 
 after their investigation they had learned that the ceo had in fact received $ <unk> million up front for the project 
 but instead of investing it into the company he spent it all on himself including a new home valued over $ <unk> new cars etc 
 you can only imagine what happened next ... pretty much every employee quit the day after the article ran 
 the group from california sued him shortly afterwards because they <unk> that money and got nothing back 
 the ceo was taken to court 
 he was sued by 7 of his previous employees $ <unk> awarded to each employee 
 he lost his home car and was now seen as a joke in the industry 
 after all this he moved to a different province but things got worse 
 he had to file for bankruptcy claiming $ <unk> in <unk> 
 one of my <unk> recently got a job at the same magazine 
 i asked him if he could look through their <unk> to see if the information i had leaked to them is what caused their investigations 
 sure enough it all started because of my email <unk> with their <unk> i work at a grocery store 
 i do my job and i do it well 
 i 'm known as the person everyone can count on and i 'm well liked and respected 
 my coworker has worked there longer than me 
 she went to college and <unk> herself better and smarter than everyone else 
 she constantly acts like she is the boss of the place and is always telling me what to do and making up rules that are n't needed 
 if anyone makes any kind of mistake she makes a huge deal about it 
 she has to go around tell every single person 
 if someone messes up something in production she brings it around and shows it to everyone 
 she also constantly complains about the way people do things even things that are n't relevant to her job at all 
 for example at night the <unk> have to go and get packaging that we use to package what we make 
 i tend to wait until something is actually getting low and grab a whole box of the item from the supplies area in the back of the store rather than grabbing a tiny bit of everything every night because i think it wastes time 
 to most people it does n't matter what way you do it because either way it gets done 
 not this girl 
 she constantly complains about me doing it this way and says that i never fill the packaging '' and i do n't do anything but sit around when i close '' 
 she constantly goes to the managers about this issue and they ignore her because it does n't matter 
 so she complains loudly and often about how our managers are idiots who do n't know how to run anything 
 she does shit like this constantly 
 i used to just ignore her but i finally snapped 
 i came in the other day and she had gone around telling everyone and all of the managers that i had n't pulled the icing out of the fridge the night before so it would be soft for <unk> cakes in the morning 
 she gave me a lecture when i walked in and i informed her that yes i did i pulled several buckets 
 she then responded oops i thought you did n't 
 i did n't know the date yesterday '' 
 so we had plenty of icing for the day but she was going to yell at me anyways because in her eyes i should 've pulled more anyways 
 she had also already gone around telling all the managers and my coworkers that i did n't do it and did n't bother to apologize or correct herself to anyone making me look bad 
 i was done 
 this happens so damn often 
 so done i proceeded to go on facebook and print out every instance of her insulting a customer on facebook for the last few months 
 this was easy because she never shuts up and posts long angry <unk> often 
 when i was done i had 10 different posts that were at least a paragraph long 
 her page is completely public so anyone can see these 
 in the posts she called customers various things 
 disgusting pigs because when she was eating lunch she could hear someone chewing next to her that she wished she could slap the fuck out of them '' idiots had terrible taste mocked a black customer 's name along with a picture of her cake called a customer a crazy bitch and called our <unk> lazy <unk> because there was a loose shopping cart in the parking lot 
 so i gave it to my manager who is taking it straight to hr today 
 our company takes this kind of thing extremely seriously since we are all about customer service 
 i ca n't fucking wait 
 she will have no idea who did it either because she has pissed off everyone 
 it could be anyone 
 my granddad told me this story a few months back 
 he used to own a trailer <unk> business in the mid to late <unk> 
 some guy returned a trailer from my granddad and after he left granddad realised he had <unk> out the trailer 's brand new tyres for 4 older ones obviously in much worse condition 
 so being the kind of guy my granddad is he drives to the guy 's house and demands his tyres back 
 the guy refuses so my granddad gives him the choice of either giving the tyres back or calling the police down 
 the guy says he ca n't give the tyres back because he does n't have a jack on him but my granddad knew he 'd make an excuse like that and had taken one with him 
 granddad starts taking his tyres off this guys car who then asks so do i get my old tyres back then '' 
 granddad just says nah '' leaves the guys car in his own driveway with no tyres and takes his own tyres back and keeps the guys old ones <unk> there 
 first time poster english is not my first language so please be generous with typos and stuffs 
 here 's my story : about a year ago i was getting home after long session of <unk> <unk> with gf 
 i was pretty tired so the plan was : get ass home shower lay on bed forever 
 before i get to the point i need to tell you a bit about the place i live in 
 i live in an apartment in a building kinda out of town 
 building has two <unk> : a small one for <unk> and a large one for cars 
 there are parking lots inside for residents however we often <unk> that there is not much room for parking cars inside just in front of the large gate there is a large area that can be <unk> right from the street and is actually part of the property so i have taken the habit of parking my car a small one just there on the side of the large gate 
 this way there is more room for the other residents inside and i don’t need to carry the <unk> for the large gate which i always lose anyway 
 for those that are just passing by it is not really clear that the large area is actually part of the property so people sometimes park there thinking it is a free space after we explain the situation people always move without problems but we got tired of this so we recently put some “no parking” signs inside the area and this stopped happening 
 ok so i was tired and in need of rest i get home and i see a big van some electric <unk> company parked right in my spot 
 i usually don’t get mad at these things but i was tired and the guy parked right in front of the “no parking” sign 
 i can not park anywhere else since i would block the way in/out of the other residents 
 so i park in front of the large gate get out of my car and approach the van 
 on the passenger seat there is a large lady 2l and i signed her to open the window 
 i kindly explained her that this is a private property and she needs to move the van 
 2l : but there’s nowhere else to park 
 me : i am sorry but as i told you this is a private property and i need to park here 
 2l : why can’t you park next to us 
 me : it would block the way of the other residents 
 isn’t that obvious 
 2l : oh so you live here then why don’t you park inside 
 at this point i would like everyone to notice that there is absolutely no need for me to explain why i can’t park inside 
 all she needs to know is that she is on private property and needs to go 
 anyway i explain the situation and she told me that the electrician her husband was making repairs in the building next to mine and in 5 minutes they were leaving 
 now i am a bit pissed because i already know is not going to be 5 min and i would have to go and up and down at least once to move the car and if someone wanted to get in/out in the meanwhile they would rightfully be mad at me 
 so i just leave the car there and go to my apartment thankfully i have a window which let me see just the entrance and can check if they are still there 
 after <unk> min they are still there i need to rest and i am pissed so i go to confront them 
 2l tells me that the guy came back but only to get some new stuffs from the van and needed to do extra repair 
 me : why didn’t you tell him to move the van 
 2l : he said it was only going to take 10 min 
 how is this an answer 
 me : i am not interested in that you need to move the van 
 2l : just relax 
 i am more pissed now me : listen i kindly asked you to move the van if you don’t i will call the police and have it removed 
 2l : alright alright i will try to call him but he probably won’t answer 
 2l calls the guy but he won’t <unk> the phone 
 2l : see 
 see 
 laughing she starts to show me the ringing phone as if this is something that i am supposed to be interested in 
 2l : see 
 he won’t answer 
 me : i don’t care 
 you need to move the car 
 why don’t you tell me where he is 
 i will tell him 
 2l : he is in that building but i don’t know which apartment 
 <unk> 
 i can’t ring every apartment just to find the idiot 
 i give a look inside the van and i see that he left the keys there 
 me : hey you have the key there 
 why don’t you move the van 
 2l : <unk> 
 are you crazy 
 he is gon na be mad 
 <unk> me : i don’t care 
 you must move the van 
 2l : just relax 
 i can’t do anything 
 just <unk> here and tell him when he comes back 
 now i am really pissed 
 i don’t say anything and i just start to walk in circles like a <unk> 
 after 10 min fat electrician fe finally shows up he is <unk> tall and at least 420 pounds 
 i approach him but he starts to shout at me first 
 fe : what is the problem 
 me : this is private property 
 you can’t park here 
 move the van 
 fe : why can’t you park inside 
 <unk> 
 me : i just can’t ok 
 move the van or i call the police 
 fe : you know what 
 fine 
 call the police 
 he ignores me get some stuffs from the van and went back to his work 
 now i could have called the police but i am not sure they would have had the van removed and i might have caused a big fuss for nothing but police or not those people were going to pay 
 revenge mode : on 
 i took pictures of their license plate and the name of their company with my phone then got in my car move it and parked right behind them i was like 1-2 inches from the back of their van 
 stupid fe parked like 2 inches from the “no parking” sign my car was behind it and a small wall was on their left the right was free but there’s no way they could have maneuvered out of it 
 more important : the <unk> was now free and the residents could go in/out 
 i tell <unk> i got their license and <unk> just in case they were to try damage my car and that i would be back in a couple hours to move the car if i remembered to 
 i went back to my apartment and turned tv on 
 after 10 min i hear people screaming at the entrance 
 i took the <unk> and asked what was the problem 
 fe is crazy angry and wants me to move the car 
 <unk> i got it i am <unk> went back to watch tv 
 another 10 min pass and more screaming 
 this time i go 
 fe : you have to move the car right now 
 me : why 
 this is my property 
 fe : you can’t block my way 
 i got work to do 
 me : fine 
 call the police 
 i am not sure the police would have removed his stupid van but sure as hell they weren’t going to remove my car from my property at this point fe is really mad and start screaming obscenities 
 one thing i didn’t notice : he had a lot of large electrical stuffs on the ground cables and others 
 but he couldn’t put it back in because his stupid van didn’t have a <unk> entrance but only in the back where my car blocks the way 
 why am i telling this 
 because it is starting to rain 
 all his stupid things could get damaged 
 i notice he also understand the situation so i say : me : ok ok. how about i do you a favor 
 i will move my car but you will have to pay me 
 say 50 <unk> 
 fe : are you fucking with me 
 ’ me : as you wish 
 you can pay me or call the police and see if they give a shit about you 
 if you don’t pay i will move the car in a couple more hours 
 fe starts screaming more obscenities get into the van and comes back with my money 
 i take my money and move the car 
 fe and 2l load their stuffs and leave at full speed 
 no one should ever be in my spot 
 this is going to be long i apologize i tried to be brief but you have to know how awful this girl is 
 so my boyfriend 's brother joe '' was dating this girl amber '' and nobody liked amber 
 when i first started dating my boyfriend zeke '' he asked if i 'd like to hang out with joe and amber one night go on a double date 
 i said sure 
 well on the way there zeke warned me that no one liked amber he said she was stuck up and rude 
 i 'm not the type to base my opinions on what others say so while i heard what he said i told him i appreciated the heads up but i 'd make my own decisions about her 
 well she was awful indeed 
 she 'd give everyone dirty looks throughout dinner she would n't talk to anyone but joe unless addressed directly and then you 'd get an eye roll and a one or two word answer 
 also she 's a big girl i have nothing against big girls but she dressed like a cheap hooker in clothes far too revealing and too tight for her with thick black <unk> <unk> makeup and <unk> hair 
 joe 's a sweetheart 
 decent looking funny generous kind gentle friendly 
 just all around a great guy 
 in every way possible he has been like a brother to me and i love him like family 
 anytime joe and zeke would try to hang out amber would complain 
 on the rare occasion that joe and zeke got to hang out it would usually be with their other brother todd 
 todd 's a nice guy nice wife cute son 
 we all get along great except when amber is there 
 so when the boys got to hang out i 'd usually stay home because they got so little time together but sure enough amber would be calling and texting and bitching the whole time about how joe was always so busy 
 and it 's not fair 
 and when is he coming home 
 it was ridiculous 
 at one point about a year into dating zeke joe called us and asked if we would give amber one more shot 
 he invited us to dinner asked us to really just try because he loved her and he was at the end of his rope 
 if she could n't get along with us he was done 
 we all agreed to go 
 amber made an effort so did i we became friendly we had lunch and <unk> shopping a few times 
 joe seemed relieved 
 amber had bought a kitten 
 kitten grew into a cat 
 then she decided she wanted a lab puppy instead 
 i asked what she was planning on doing with the cat 
 she said she was going to drop it off on the side of the road in the country 
 i begged her not to i asked her to bring the cat to my apartment where we are not allowed pets and i 'd find the cat a new home just do n't drop it off on the road as a <unk> would probably find it and kill it 
 she laughed and said i do n't care i hate that cat 
 i want my puppy '' 
 again i asked her to please give me the cat 
 no dice 
 the cat got dropped off on the side of the road and i never saw it again 
 so she got a lab puppy 
 a sweet pretty little lab girl who loved to <unk> and give puppy breath <unk> 
 about six months in she decided she wanted a chihuahua 
 so she got rid '' of the black lab without notice 
 we still do n't know what happened to the black lab 
 but who cares 
 she got her <unk> chihuahua 
 then he proposed 
 amber said yes 
 and went back to crazy 
 zeke was asked to be the best man 
 i was not asked to be in the wedding party which was honestly fine with me 
 to be honest i did n't trust the dress she would have put me in and i did n't want to have to pay for all the extras 
 well she asked me to come to a dress fitting for her 
 i said sure and asked when she could pick me up since zeke had our car that day she had to pass my house on her way too the dress shop anyway i was sick and it was pouring out portland or 
 rain is not uncommon here 
 amber replied no you can take the bus '' 
 i politely said i 'd attend a different fitting 
 she then invited me a few weeks later i said sure and planned on going 
 well she cancelled on me the morning of the fitting saying she wanted to go with another friend at a different time and if i could n't get off work i could n't come 
 well i was n't taking time off work so again i declined but said if there was anything else i could help with just let me know 
 and i volunteered my time effort and money to make their wedding favors by hand 
 i <unk> and was going to do a chocolate dipped cookie for them and decorate the cookies in their wedding colors wrap them in pretty bags and tie <unk> on them for over 100 guests 
 about a week after that zeke and i invited joe and amber over for dinner and game night which is something we all try to get together for on a <unk> basis 
 they came over and zeke asked amber how wedding planning was going 
 amber had the nerve to look right at me and say well if someone would help me it would be a lot easier '' 
 what 
 i later sent her a facebook message that stated since i was not related to her in the wedding party or being paid by her that she had no right to ask me for anything for her wedding 
 and that anything i volunteered to do was because i wanted to and was not obligated to do anything <unk> was all i said 
 no angry words no <unk> no name calling just straight forward 
 well she had a field day and told joe that i called her a bitch and <unk> 
 i saved screen shots of the messages and the messages themselves on facebook i tried to tell joe i did n't say anything mean to her or call her any names but she had found a way to <unk> with the messages and had written in terrible things that looked like they were from me 
 zeke knew i never said anything mean to her he saw the messages before i sent them he watched me type them because i wanted to know if he minded me sending them and wanted to make sure i did n't come across as mean or unnecessarily harsh 
 joe was n't having it 
 he was understandably upset with me thinking i had said these things 
 i then found out she had told other people the same lies about me that i was verbally attacking her calling her names etc 
 none of that was happening by the way 
 and anyone who knows me will tell you i am very friendly and <unk> and i 'm nice to everyone 
 now around this time we found out that i am pregnant 
 their wedding was scheduled for six days before my due date for about 3 weeks i stewed not knowing what pregnancy <unk> would do to me not wanting to go to the wedding and say or do something awful if <unk> 
 i asked zeke if he minded terribly if i did n't go knowing full well i 'd be a hormonal pregnant mess 
 he said it was fine 
 i then asked if i could write her a letter telling her what i really thought of her bones and all 
 zeke said go for it as long as it 's all true but leave todd out of it 
 he hates her but wants to talk to joe in his own way in his own time '' 
 i said that was fine then <unk> that if i wrote the letter it would be <unk> honest no holds barred i 'm done kind of thing 
 and that it could have some <unk> from joe to zeke since i 'd be telling her exactly how i felt 
 zeke said as long as it was true go for it 
 so i did 
 i wrote her a letter telling her how selfish i thought she was how trashy tacky rude and shallow 
 what a golddigger she was that she was a liar 
 that the way she treated her animals was <unk> 
 and to never contact me again and to remove my name from her guest list as i would not be attending 
 i read it to zeke he said it was all true so send it 
 and i did 
 20 minutes later zeke 's phone is buzzing like crazy with texts from joe telling him to keep <unk> in line 
 she 's saying things that are n't okay '' 
 zeke replied that everything i said was true he agreed to the message i sent 
 zeke and joe yelled for about a half hour 
 it was n't fun 
 well word got out to todd and his wife <unk> '' that i 'd sent the facebook message 
 i showed them the messages 
 they 'd all heard from amber that i was saying horrible things all of which i had proof that i 'd never said 
 then todd joe and zeke 's mom and dad heard about it 
 all of a sudden everyone is admitting that they ca n't stand amber 
 dad said he would n't stop the wedding but he was n't paying another dime and if it went on he would n't attend 
 todd was neutral but told joe he did not like amber at all but that he loves joe and he 'll support him no matter what 
 a week later joe left amber 
 she cried whined accused tried to get money from him etc 
 and the whole time everyone knew i was the <unk> that caused the <unk> 
 at first i felt bad 
 but joe is so much happier it 's like he 's an entire different person 
 and so many people have thanked me for it saying they did n't have the guts to say what i said 
 even joe thanked me like a week ago 
 amber is still furious but i do n't care 
 she 's single and being trashy lost her apartment and had to move back in with her parents and loser brother her job has gone to crap but at least she 's doing it far away from all of us 
 tl dr boyfriend 's brother was dating a lying tacky trashy selfish golddigger 
 <unk> lurking for a while and felt it was time to give back ... this happened several years ago 
 i was working full time at a <unk> job while putting myself through college at night paying for it out of pocket 
 this left me stretched on finances so i ended up in a less than ideal apartment complex and by less than ideal i mean that the cops maintained a presence there most of the time 
 most folks kept to themselves but occasionally you 'd get someone that was just obnoxious living near you 
 it was inevitable 
 i knew it was my turn with an obnoxious neighbor when i first met him 
 he was talking loudly in the breezeway of my building 
 why he was n't on the balcony of his apartment i do n't know 
 not wanting to be petty i just turned the tv up and ignored him 
 it was n't long before the talking got louder and my door started moving like someone was trying to open it 
 i jerked it open and the guy about fell in 
 it turns out he was leaning on it while having his conversation 
 after politely letting him know that it was very annoying i give him an it 's all good '' and close my door 
 immediately he refers to me using a racial slur in spanish to the person on the other end of the phone 
 i may not be <unk> in spanish but i know some important <unk> 
 he 'd have parties all night sometimes with a dozen people in the breezeway getting drunk and rowdy 
 there was always trash on the stairs e.g. half eaten <unk> old <unk> etc and cigarette butts everywhere 
 his large pit bull would <unk> all day just about <unk> 
 i could bitch about it and be the whiny neighbor or just bide my time until i graduate and then move 
 graduation was only a semester away so i decided to bide my time 
 coming home from school one night i 'm walking through the parking lot reading my phone when i see a dog running at me growling 
 it 's dude 's pit bull <unk> to attack me 
 dude 's girlfriend yells at him and he calls his dog off and breaks out laughing 
 enough 's enough someone 's going to get hurt so i complain to the apartment manager but am told without proof their hands were tied 
 great 
 i live the next few months at the complex relatively incident free just the above <unk> until i 'm woken up one week night at 2am 
 there 's screaming and crying in the breezeway lots of loud talking and the sounds of incoming sirens 
 looking out my window into the parking lot and i see dude run by with his dog 
 looking through the peep hole i see a girl in the hallway bleeding profusely 
 turns out his girlfriend and her friend were drunk and raised their voices at one another 
 the dog then attacked the friend mauling her pretty badly 
 police did n't know where either dude or the dog was and the friend did n't want to pursue charges so they left 
 shortly after they left dude comes back with the dog 
 i did call the police and let them know that he and the dog were back but they never returned thanks police 
 on my way to work the next morning i stop by the apartment manager and let her know about the incident 
 again she says she ca n't do anything without proof 
 i <unk> her to call the police and confirm but she refuses saying they get updates from the sheriff every month 
 ultimately her problem was that due to legal reasons she ca n't seek to evict someone herself otherwise it might look like she 's targeting a given race or something 
 fuming about the situation while at work i managed to find the police incident report for the mauling online 
 i printed it out and delivered it to her on my way home 
 she had an appreciative look on her face and told me the eviction process would start before i could leave the building 
 true to her word the bad neighbor was out at the end of the month 
 according to the apartment manager they were pissed and cussing as they drove away 
 turns out he had numerous warrants so had his girlfriend rent the apartment 
 neither of them had family in the area the girlfriend 's family lived in another country so they had no one to turn to for a place to stay 
 the icing on the cake was when the apartment manager let slip that when the next apartment called her for a reference she 'd kindly inform them of all incidents that occurred 
 i do n't know what happened to them but i do know they had a hard time finding a place to live 
 tl dr : be an asshole to your polite and quiet neighbor 
 enjoy being homeless 
 **i posted this as a reply in another thread but a couple people told me to post this here as well : ** sorry in advance on mobile on a plane 
 i worked in the finance department of a dealership 
 in order to secure financing vehicles had to have proof of insurance submitted to the finance company before the customer can take possession 
 that was my job so when the customers first sat down with me i 'd tell them to get their insurance arranged and send me proof 
 one day i hear my name being paged for a phone call 
 i pick it up hello <unk> speaking how can i help you '' 
 the voice on the phone says are you the asshole who needs proof of insurance '' 
 **me : ** excuse me '' 
 <unk> : ** did you sell a vehicle to mr and mrs. x and now want me to get the insurance '' 
 **me : ** well we sold them a vehicle yes ... '' him : how the fuck can i arrange insurance without a vin '' **me : ** <unk> they have a copy of the bill of sale '' the conversation continued like this for a <unk> him swearing me answering his stupid questions 
 basically he blamed me for the customers not giving him the information he needed 
 and apparently the customers were quite <unk> to pick it up so when i told them i had n't received proof of insurance they must have called him and gotten angry 
 so anyways i have no problem talking to insurance agents if the customers did n't do what they should have but nobody calls me an asshole and gets away with it 
 **revenge step 1** use <unk> to ring him every 10 minutes at 3am 
 that 's what you get for having your home number in the phone book 
 **revenge step 2** he is an insurance broker so he does a fair amount of advertising 
 one of the places he <unk> was on kijiji canadian craigslist 
 i had seen his ads a ton he was actually pretty successful one nice feature about kijiji is you can see posters other ads '' 
 this asshole also happened to have rental apartments all over town 
 so with a couple fake email accounts i arranged <unk> for his dozen or so apartments every day of the week for the next month 
 never fuck with a retail <unk> they have way too much free time 
 i got about a dozen angry emails back asking why i did n't show before i noticed he stopped advertising on kijiji 
 **revenge step <unk> my piece de resistance was shortly after i quit the dealership 
 i still hated this guy or well i actually did n't care but he seemed like a dick 
 my friend works it for a large insurance company and i had helped him out with something that required me to get an email address with the insurance company 's domain 
 so i logged in and created my signature as vp of <unk> '' and gave him a call 
 i told him we were interested in buying his brokerage since we saw his success from <unk> 
 he was sucking my dick from the beginning telling me how successful he was and how inch business he <unk> 
 i told him to email me his relevant financials and that i would call him back 
 so he does and i actually put the effort into coming up with a reasonable purchase price 
 and then i added a couple hundred thousand to make it <unk> for him 
 i called him back gave him the offer and then asked if he would be interested in he team as a vp after the buyout 
 he said he would so i asked him to come down to our offices for an interview 
 the key part here is the offices of this insurance company are in a big city a four hour drive from where he lives 
 i told him i 'd like to meet at 9am 
 so this asshole has to leave his house at 5am to make it i also told him to bring me a coffee 
 at this point i tell me friend to delete the email address he knew what i was doing although perhaps not as in depth and i also called him from a blocked number because well i did n't want to get caught 
 so unfortunately i ca n't say for 100 % sure that it worked 
 but two weeks later i did call his brokerage from my regular number 
 he answered the phone 
 i said are you the asshole who drove four hours to x city for a fake interview '' 
 there was a long pause i can hear him steaming up through the phone and then he said who the fuck is this 
 i hung up 
 do n't be <unk> account 
 for the past week or so my mom and i have been playing host to my asshole cousin 
 the kid came down to check out universities but took fuck all interest in them and just started to be rude to myself and my mom 
 not cool 
 but for everyday that he 's been living with us something 's gone wrong in my bathroom - either the bathmats are <unk> waters fucking everywhere it smells like piss and more 
 a bit of <unk> shit he did was use my personal razor to shave his pubes 
 he thought he could hide it by cleaning the front of the razor of the evidence and not the floor of the shower <unk> 
 however today i found my bathroom floor completely wet and sticky smelling of <unk> and piss and both bathmats flung all over the fucking place - oh and complete with pubes 
 in a fit of fucking rage over the way he 's acting treating me mom and threatening to steal my stuff i took his toothbrush 
 and gave the drain a little clean 
 more of a scrub 
 and his <unk> 
 we 'll just say that they 're fucking fantastic for cleaning shit <unk> and piss from your toilet 
 was i done there 
 <unk> no this is 20 years of resentment towards this prick 
 his milk was next 
 nothing too malicious and nothing enough to make him sick we were out of <unk> 
 but what <unk> bad when added to milk and does n't show 
 white vinegar 
 just enough was added so it did n't change the amount that was in the container or have a strong smell 
 and for the heck of it i decided to get him back for breaking a ds of mine - by fucking up his 
 i <unk> the back and acquainted it with the business end a nail file and wet fish food thank you melted <unk> i then carefully put it back together 
 edit : / not previously mentioned in the above post but he did break the ds in plain site as well as microwave some games chew on a <unk> hit on my girl friends and make them incredibly uncomfortable told me to learn the art of keeping my mouth shut '' when i asked what he 'd study and when i left my pc unattended he tried to access personal documents and my paypal <unk> time a wise man said to me : * '' a broken heart heals quickly if you do n't let the pain get between the <unk> '' * -- or something like that - *** after over 5 years i thought meg is the one 
 high school sweetheart her parents loved me i became a family member 
 her brother just 2 years older than her had a very rare disease and since the age 10 he was on a wheelchair 
 i was always there helping out driving him for his <unk> sometimes even hundreds of miles 
 i have never accepted money for my services '' that 's what family does 
 they were rather on a poor side always beaten by life always struggling 
 father in another country sending money getting every financial aid possible in a huge debt 
 i was n't doing too good but i decided to sacrifice my own <unk> for something that mattered to me 
 *** i and meg had lived together in the past and we decided to live together again 
 we did n't split mostly the decisions of living together or not were financially based 
 i spent my whole summer to make our new place look better 
 i put a lot of money in it 
 besides working and fixing the condo i had n't had time for anything else 
 i was excited for meg to come back 
 we had n't talked much since she had a summer job in another country 
 i understood that and i knew she will spend her earned money wisely after she 'll come back 
 *** she came back and she was a different person 
 short skirt heels a lot of makeup 
 she was never like this 
 always very modest generous appreciative and always helping to other people 
 she had a very good heart and i did n't know what is going on 
 i felt she 's not meg any more 
 not the one i knew 
 she was very distant and i knew there is more 
 i was patient and gave her time 
 after enough time had past i asked her to take a drive with me which took little convincing 
 i took her to one of our spots where we had shared a lot 
 she told me nothing besides asking for a month break 
 i did n't say a word but it felt in my hear like it 's over 
 month break from what 
 a relationship 
 it does n't work that way not for me 
 i agreed and told her to take her time 
 this break '' month was very hard for me 
 did n't seem hard for her 
 i still could n't understand why she had changed so much 
 yet i was helping out with her brother which even included helping him to get dressed and other basic tasks if you know what i mean 
 *** one day when our good friend came to visit us with a bottle of wine meg started crying for no reason 
 she closed herself in the restroom 
 since our friend was there i asked her to keep an eye on her and i decided to take a drive since it helps me to think 
 during the drive something occurred to me 
 i just started to see everything as a whole picture 
 suddenly all the dots were connecting themselves 
 cheating has crossed my mind before but i am not a paranoid person and i do n't let my emotions determine my actions 
 but this time everything every small thing started to be a part of the puzzle 
 i called my friend asking if meg 's ok and decided to give her some more time and get her little worried about me 
 i knew her well and my plan was to make her emotionally involved in me 
 with her not knowing where i 'm at i knew she would feel out of control about the situation and i knew her emotions will explode at some point 
 at least i hoped for that 
 i went to see her mother 
 it was a 200 miles drive so i had some time to think 
 meg 's mom also knew something was wrong and she was worried like every mother would 
 i had a very close relationship with the mother 
 having no choice i told her that i think it 's over between me and meg not going into the details 
 her mother cried and it felt like a goodbye 
 that was the last time i saw her 
 when i was on my way back i got a text from meg that she 's going home for a few days and she 's in the bus now 
 *** it had never crossed my mind to <unk> meg 's privacy but meg 's mother called me when meg was on the bus back to our condo 
 her mother checked meg 's phone when she was at her mother 's 
 i just could n't keep hanging like this any more 
 the texts of course confirmed my <unk> about cheating however i have never seen the text on my own 
 i asked her mother to not talk to her about that and she agreed 
 *** when meg got home i was n't there 
 i decided to spend a few days at my friend 's place just to heat up her emotions 
 what i tried to achieve was to make her feel that my behavior is out of ordinary <unk> 
 which would make her suspicious and feeling out of control 
 i knew meg 's schedule and i got perfectly when she was in the middle of her morning shower 
 i thought i will see something which would confirm my <unk> 
 i hid under the bed so she would n't see me 
 i heard her checking my stuff in the part of the room which was mine later checking my desk definitely looking for something 
 she left but i knew her well enough and i decided to lay under the bed for another 10-15 minutes 
 sure enough she forgot something as always 
 additional 15 minutes under the bed and time to investigate 
 my work was starting in 2 hours so i did n't have much time 
 nothing obvious after fast search and i could n't find anything which she has taken from me but she definitely did and it did n't sound like an office supply 
 it felt shameful but i felt i do n't have any choice 
 something definitely was going on 
 i <unk> her laptop <unk> her hard drive and copied all the hard drive to mine 
 after work i went to visit my friend who 's a computer wizard 
 i knew with his help i will get to the files i need much quicker 
 finding the <unk> files is n't hard but how do you read them 
 sure enough with his help and a little bit of time i was able to read everything from my computer 
 just by skimming thru it was obvious for me 
 cheating was just the top of the iceberg of the things i got to know 
 i got back home and sure enough my checks are gone 
 i could n't believe it 
 it was just not like her 
 *** at that point i knew it 's over for life 
 a few months ago i got an offer to move to the us where i live now 
 nothing was there to stop me but what 's my plan 
 i can go i have the visa money but ... and then this amazing feeling of the adventure 
 all my life i was very static very reasonable sensible and <unk> 
 never done anything crazy 
 i felt like to shake things up a little 
 i mean a lot 
 first things first i had to take care of the business 
 *** as early as i could i closed my bank account changed all the passwords just in case and called the owner of the condo 
 when meg was at work with the help of my best friend alex i packed all my belongings 
 the owner of the condo came and she was sure impressed about the <unk> 
 i told her i had to move out and we need to figure out the way to terminate the contract 
 after all she gave me the deposit back and i did n't have to pay this month 's rent and utilities 
 she even agreed to <unk> the internet contract to her 
 she knew she will be able to get much better deal on the condo and since i was a perfect tenant she trusted me 
 i told her my ex-girlfriend will move out in a few days 
 she made big eyes but no questions asked 
 next was my job 
 i went to see my boss showed my resignation letter and we said goodbye in peace 
 no hard feelings 
 i left a short note to my ex 
 we have to move out 
 you have time until date '' 
 i also blocked my ex on my phone email and social media 
 *** *here is what i know from couple of our shared friends : * meg freaked out about the whole situation 
 she told all the friends i was cheating on her 
 she got in some trouble at work after she tried to steal some equipment and was fired 
 she quit her school and until this day she does n't have a degree she had less than 2 semesters left 
 she moved to the country where her new boyfriend was 
 after about 7 months since i saw her last time she got a baby girl not mine 
 her boyfriend ended up in a jail for some reason and spent there 6 months 
 from what i know they are together but it is n't a happy relationship 
 *** *what i know from the mother : * nothing 
 i decided to leave the family alone 
 i thought it will be the best for all 
 *** *what i know from meg : * nothing 
 she sent me birthday wishes twice which ended up in trash as soon as i got them 
 she sent it to my parent 's house 
 they do n't live there they 're with me now but they 've kept the house 
 *** **what i did and i think hope happened : ** i moved out and meg does n't know what the heck is going on 
 she sees the note calls to the owner who explains her the situation and that 's how she gets to know she 's my ex now 
 she goes to empty my account but she ca n't get money with the checks 
 since she 's not a detective type and she 's driven by emotions she 's just furious 
 i took every single <unk> i gave her 
 i mean everything i could find and i donated it with her name 
 she received a thank you '' letter from a local <unk> care house 
 so she knows that <unk> stuff was n't stolen by me it was donated by her* and she ca n't do a thing about it 
 her car was technically mine 
 it was a very crappy car at a shop for a repair during the events 
 i bought it from our friend who was in need and since then she always wanted to get it back 
 i sold the car back to her for the price of the car plus the repair cost asking her to give back the things left in the car to meg 
 just to play some more evil i found on <unk> european craigslist a cheap ass bicycle which fit into meg 's car perfectly 
 i hope she was smart enough to get the message 
 lastly meg 's brother borrowed from me the equivalent of $ <unk> 
 it was for he 's new wheelchair computer and some minor stuff 
 i decided i will just leave it 
 i sent a package to meg 's brother and mother he lived with her and i stuffed it with his favorite things plus i bought him an xbox with some games 
 it was a goodbye letter to him and the mother letting them know i 'm moving to the us 
 that 's how meg got to know where i will be 
 the letter did n't mention a word about her 
 meg hates me her family loves me 
 *** after time has passed i think i could do some things better like not digging in her laptop which makes me feel shameful 
 at that time i felt it was the only option 
 some things i have done i feel i could n't do better 
 moving to the us was the best decision of my life 
 it was hard in the beginning but for sure i want to live here 
 i have n't visited my country since i moved 
 4 years pass in 2 months 
 *** **tl dr^ ex-girlfriend gets taken away everything even her family 
 ** *** *** *edit 1 : someone here had a problem with understanding how the hell i was able to copy 200gb in less than 2 hours thinking that i had to unscrew a laptop to the pieces i wrote here about <unk> so that 's number <unk> that tells it 's an apple machine 
 to explain ... it was a macbook which requires just a few screws at the bottom side and than just 4 or maybe even less to get the hard drive out 
 the files were copied using an enclosure you simply hook up the hard drive to the enclosure and drag the files 
 how long did it take 
 about an hour from what i remember 
 i know i was able to make the whole operation in less than 2 hours with getting to work on time walking distance 
 <unk> i copy 200gb in matter of a few minutes to my laptop using this and this i assume the person who has a problem has to have a very old computer 
 i do n't remember if the hard drive had <unk> on it 200gb on it or just <unk> 
 i remember it 's capacity was <unk> i assume it was <unk> ii <unk> or <unk> 
 the enclosure was <unk> <unk> files copied straight from meg 's hard drive to my computer 
 * *** *edit 2 : a few people shown a concern here about the checks 
 after a recent pm i feel it 's worth to explain 
 checks in europe do not work like in the us 
 same idea but they are not common 
 not every bank will accept them 
 in my country and bank the checks were more like actual money which had to be covered by money on the account or payed with cash 
 they are used for the international transactions 
 i sort of had to buy '' these checks 
 i wanted to purchase a motorcycle from the us <unk> <unk> since it 's much cheaper 
 i was almost about to purchase it 
 i had one check on $ 12,000 one on $ 1,000 and one on $ 1,800 or something close 
 since meg was my girlfriend she knew that i want to buy a motorcycle 
 she knew how it works etc 
 i decided to go with the check because with that kind of amount the fees with a bank transfer would increase the price in my situation 
 the checks had only printed amounts 
 it was up to me who i will write them to 
 meg knew all of this as well as that i have even more on my bank account 
 that were my life savings since i got my first job 
 a sport motorcycle was my dream 
 well i still do n't have it 
 all my saving i had to invest in my future in the us 
 it will happen anyway 
 * *** <unk> 12 years ago i found out my ex had been cheating while i was out working a job that required me to travel 
 in an attempt to fix the marriage i took a different job where i was home 
 the job was in southern <unk> so we moved from nc 
 we had a 18 month old son who was obviously still in diapers 
 this will be important later 
 after trying for a few months she left me to go back to her boyfriends 
 enter the large uhaul that she loaded almost everything we owned into while i was working 
 i came home and all she had left was to hook the car up to the tow <unk> 
 she could n't figure it out 
 i refused to help her and went into the house 
 in the empty bedroom i was greeted by a horrible stench 
 she had left a diaper that was packed full of fresh baby shit and still warm 
 she left in the uhaul to find someone to help her hook up the car and i took the diaper out and put it under the drivers seat of the car 
 georgia in august is <unk> 
 she came back about 15 minutes later with a guy who opened the door to the car and nearly puked while i sat in the house an laughed 
 her brother later told me that they had to sell the car because the stench was in everything 
 they almost had to give it <unk> i was walking home from <unk> and just <unk> my drink before i left for my walk home 
 as im cutting across the parking lot near a very busy street important later a car pulls up next to me and a girl with a nice white dress on asks me if i knew how to get to some <unk> so as i walked closer to the car to tell them which way they should take 
 the guy in the back and the girl threw eggs at me luckily only one hit my leg and the rest missed but i still had my large drink from <unk> that was basically full so i threw the drink and managed to get it right in the window and got the girl right in the chest 
 the pop exploded and <unk> her and they sped off onto the busy street 
 so i continued heading home and after a block or two i see them pulled over by a cop car 
 im guessing they got pulled over for speeding on one of the busiest streets 
 as i walk by the car i see the girl with a big brown <unk> on her dress 
 i just smiled at her and walked <unk> is a long story but i 've marked off the revenge '' and pro revenge '' bits with appropriate <unk> to facilitate skimming 
 **background** around 8 years ago i applied for a job working for a relatively small organization as a manager 
 instead of the position i applied for they offered me a different job reporting to the person they hired for the management position - still a step up in my career but not quite as good 
 i accepted the job and soon after was invited out to dinner to meet my new manager 
 let 's call her sara 
 i immediately became <unk> of sara 
 she presented as a devout christian woman while throwing shade at her previous co-workers and jobs all of which raised <unk> i my mind 
 i <unk> myself to being polite but distant from her rather than running away as fast as i could because i figured i might have the wrong idea about her 
 yeah not so much ... as soon as we started working together she started <unk> off much of her work to me 
 she hated making phone calls which she was required to make so i got stuck with those 
 she would n't return messages from clients so i ended up doing that too 
 the organization was small and had a serious resource shortage something which was made worse by some recent system changes that were made right around the time we arrived 
 her <unk> was positioned as <unk> '' since she dealing with fixing those systems issues 
 the higher-ups saw it as a temporary issue and <unk> me to be cooperative 
 soon i was working 60 hours a week trying to keep up with the workload 
 i got paid overtime but no amount of money can make up for constantly being thrown under the bus by your incompetent boss because i could n't handle the workload i was being asked to manage 
 nobody could 
 when she would actually get called on the carpet for mistakes and issues she would yell and scream at me while simultaneously blaming me for the problems she caused 
 meanwhile she was having long conversations with anyone who <unk> past her doorway leaving at 4 everyday with no overtime and smiling that <unk> smile of the oblivious sociopath 
 i think she truly thought she was a great and successful manager 
 i will point out that the people in upper management clearly noticed that something was up with the work in our department 
 a year had passed and things were n't getting better ... they were actually worse on my end since now i was so <unk> that i had cried a couple of times at work 
 thus they did n't pay much attention when i pointed out that our work loads were <unk> and that i was basically working both of our jobs mine and sara 's without the appropriate tools since sara had n't actually fixed the system issues she had been hired to manage 
 other people in the organization did n't really understand the system issues because they never had to use the system 
 **revenge** i finally decided that i was finished dealing with sara and needed to demonstrate the <unk> to the higher ups 
 i waited for sara to take a week of vacation and then promptly called in sick for two days once she was gone leaving the higher-ups to try and handle client issues for those two days 
 i did n't answer any calls from the office during working hours despite having some frantic how the hell do i do what the client is asking me to do '' 
 messages 
 instead i waited until after hours claimed to have been sleeping due to medication and then left long messages detailing the <unk> <unk> of how the system worked or did n't 
 i took the time to work on my resume and write up my resignation letter including an offer to stay for up to two months to facilitate a <unk> i did n't bear the <unk> worked i 'll will and the money would be helpful if i could have a set date in mind so i felt ok with a longer notice period 
 i arrived back at work after my illness and had three of the higher ups walk straight into my office shut the door and sit down 
 what the fuck is going on here '' 
 was the first thing that came <unk> out of the general manager 's mouth 
 so i spent a good ten minutes detailing the system issues reminding them that i had <unk> mentioned being <unk> and not having the tools to do my job 
 apparently sara unbeknownst to me had been bad-mouthing me to all of them calling me incompetent and slow 
 once they told me that i said i found that surprising since she had spent all of that time bad-mouthing the system to me and calling the management incompetent 
 one of the other managers told me that they were <unk> the problems to me and my emotional state and now realized after just two days of trying to do my job just how awful things really were 
 they apologized to me for doubting my claims and vowed to make changes 
 i thanked them and handed them my resignation notice telling them that i had decided to go back to school to pursue a new career and could n't do that while working for or with sara 
 over the next two months before i finally left sara basically became a woman defeated 
 i fed them every nasty word she said for two months including showing them some text messages i received in which she bad mouthed the organization 
 the gm told me they could n't fire her because anyone new would be even worse with the system but that they were taking steps to <unk> others on the system in order to be able to get rid of her 
 they <unk> her office and interrupted long conversations 
 they removed me from her control allowing me to return her <unk> work and insist she do it herself 
 we had long meetings about systems issues during which she was left looking like a bumbling incompetent 
 after i finally left they had a little party for me they called her into the <unk> office and read her the riot act for basically chasing me out the door and costing the organization a strong employee ... their words not mine 
 sara contacted me after being told off and expressed how sad she was that i would say such things 
 i denied using the words they claimed i used saying only that i talked about the circumstances and not the people 
 i lied purposefully in the faint hope that it would be useful to me in the future 
 i had no great love for the management of the organization despite their recent attempts to make <unk> and it cost me little to play both sides 
 her reputation was so bad at that point that nobody would believe her if she said i stuck up for her 
 it wound up being a good <unk> 
 they fired her 3 months later and told her not to use them as a reference 
 she has basically been stuck in a series of temporary and <unk> jobs ever since she left 
 we are still social media friends and i have seen her messages about looking for help from god and tough financial times 
 as much as i want to feel bad for her i ca n't muster up even a little bit of concern for her 
 instead i enjoyed a little private laugh at every bad thing that seemed to happen to her 
 call me a jerk but i view her as someone who tried to destroy my career to save herself some work 
 <unk> pro revenge** so it has been nearly 8 years as i said and i have finally had a chance to truly extract my pound of flesh from her 
 last week she sent me a long e-mail talking about our working together and how she 's happy to see is things have gone well for me and how she looks back fondly on our work together 
 she said she knows that we did n't work together <unk> but that she had few options and wanted to ask me for a professional reference 
 i jumped at the chance and reassured her that i held her no ill will 
 here is my contact info 
 just have them get in touch 
 anything you want me to emphasize when we talk '' 
 i got all the details and told her i would let her know when i got the call 
 i finally got the call this past thursday 
 i proceeded to damn her with as faint praise as i could possibly muster 
 i really put on the <unk> touches : weird vocal <unk> thoughtful pauses before <unk> <unk> seemingly careful and precise word selection 
 they must have heard from others about her penchant for <unk> because they asked me point blank about that too 
 i went super <unk> in my response i mean she certainly is friendly enough but i ca n't recall any personal experience with her being distracted from her work by talking too much 
 of course i spent so much time in my office that perhaps i just did n't see it '' 
 got the word this morning thanking me for the reference and saying they hired someone else for the job 
 i expressed my <unk> and told her to feel free to let me know if she needs another reference 
 she told me she would definitely be in touch 
 **tl dr - there once was a manager lady whose actions were all sorts of shady i got her ass fired she tried to get hired used my reference to keep her in <unk> in college my roommates and i three a lot of parties 
 they were well attended because we always kept a friendly vibe going on and would make you leave if you were being an ass 
 these guys from the next apt building over show to to one and are being pretty obnoxious but tolerable 
 where they <unk> crossed the line was this one girl got too drunk and she was n't with anybody who could take her home so we put her in my bed gave her some water and a bowl for <unk> if that needed to happen 
 i 'll crash on the <unk> tonight no <unk> 
 one of the douchey crew is seen hovering around my bedroom door we keep an eye on it 
 he 's suspicious to me but there 's room for doubt so we give him the benefit of it 
 but when he thinks nobody 's looking he goes in there 
 one of my roomies was watching though and goes in after him 
 i will skip the predictable discussion that was had he tried to say he was n't doing anything but he took a good while coming up with a lie we told him and his roommates to beat it 
 they actually argue with us as if they have a right to negotiate with us about whether or not they can be at our apartment after one of them almost certainly tried to rape someone 
 they got physically intimidating but i can tell actual <unk> to violence from <unk> chest pounding send them on their way firmly but without escalating 
 we seriously could n't believe what almost happened and the more we thought about it the more pissed we got 
 justice must be served 
 we got a ten gallon bucket and put it on the deck 
 we instructed every guy at the party that he had to pee in the bucket 
 a few girls even <unk> up their skirts and contributed to the fund 
 we stayed up super late drinking beer until the bitch was damn near <unk> off 
 put the lid on it carried it over to their door <unk> it against the door and tied a string from it to the <unk> 
 next morning we woke that girl up fed her eggs told her what went on and we all drank coffee on our deck while we waited for those <unk> to open the door 
 <unk> some background i 'm david and tony is my younger brother 
 i his older brother 
 i was the street <unk> fast <unk> great <unk> type kid ... the sheriff knew my <unk> number by heart 
 tony ... well tony is the well behaved <unk> kid that went on to get great grades and go to college 
 well tony ended up creating his own company 
 they do networking and servers and stuff like that 
 me 
 well i became the <unk> of 7 different dealerships 
 my job is basically the shot caller well i do n't so much call the shots more as review the decisions my managers make 
 now of course with tony being my brother and our families are close <unk> his wife my wife his children my children are always together 
 with this tony and i bounce ideas off each other all the time and are pretty in <unk> with each other business 
 heck i help fund the early days of <unk> company and a major <unk> 
 so i do have my influence which i never really <unk> i don’t know anything about his business how it works etc now tony was in the final stages of bidding on a massive contract ... basically as he explained it the contract was his and he was searching internally for the team to run this contract and he needed a project manager 
 he already had the pay plan for this position put together and whoever got it would make a shit ton of money and there was quite a bit of completion internally for this position especially among 2 prime individuals 
 maurice and allen both equally qualified however my brother was leaning towards maurice since he was with my brother for 2 years more than allen 
 now i didn’t actually know either one of them so i gave my brother my general advice which was if both can do the job and only one can have one give to the guy who has been with you the <unk> maurice was to get the position 
 my brother said he’d <unk> it over the weekend and make the big announcement that friday 
 now with me being in this business as long as i have i’ve grown to develop relationships with many different employers and many of them i have special pricing deals with them 
 tony company of course receives a special pricing deal 
 all his employees have to do is show their badge and we apply a discount to their order since they work for tony 
 now of course we do have some <unk> which we have <unk> from this <unk> various reasons 
 one of them is the ford raptor which is a hot seller and a major profit generator for us 
 so its excluded 
 well i do my rounds to the different dealers i manage and had stopped by a ford store which was having some employee issues as is fairly common in this industry and putting together a plan with the store manager when a sales person popped in and said he needed the store manager to handle a difficult customer 
 i of course enjoy getting involved in selling cars it’s a welcome relief so i inquired about the <unk> out it was maurice who works for my brothers company wanting a ford raptor 
 i told the store manager to stay put and i’ll handle this 
 so i walk out to <unk> maurice 
 maurice is insulting my dealership my employees and our practices 
 i pride ourselves on being above board on everything so this really pisses me off 
 never the less maurice is a potential customer and should be treated with respect 
 i sit down with maurice and qualify him to see whats up 
 maurice is under the impression that this friday is going get a major promotion and has decided he’s going treat himself to a nice brand new <unk> brand new ford raptor 
 thankfully the car gods have given us the exact model in options and color that maurice wants 
 which of course is the reason why maurice is at my store and not wanting to leave my store without the truck however isn’t understanding his coupon does not qualify for the ford raptor and that he should be happy we are only charging him sticker on a truck that <unk> sells for above sticker 
 i of course try to explain this to maurice who calls me a scumbag 
 this is of course the short version and maurice is being a general douche 
 i do some quick thinking look up to maurice and say <unk> i honor the pricing agreement that you believe i should honor will you purchase today ” maurice happily responds yes 
 so i have finance start up the paperwork and several times throughout this process i over hear maurice insulting my employees dealership and reputation 
 this is something i do not tolerate 
 in my opinion the most important <unk> which i have are my employees they generate the revenue which pays my bills 
 however i was going let this one slide till the very end 
 finally maurice is done with finance the vehicle is funded and he’s ready for delivery 
 i tell the operations manager i’ll personally handle this delivery and he calls me over as soon as the walk around is ready 
 so i begin showing maurice all the options and features that the ford raptor offers 
 he’s like a kid in a fucking candy store so happy with his purchase 
 still thinks we are scumbags though 
 finally we are done the paperwork is signed maurice is sitting in his brand new truck and i’m standing outside of it when i saw me : hey tony is the guy that will be promoting you on friday right 
 maurice : yea do you know him 
 me : sure do he 's my younger brother maurice ... really 
 me : yup in fact many years ago when tony was just a small startup i convinced the owner of this dealership to finance his company 
 i am confident without our support tony would of gone bankrupt in the early days of the dot <unk> bubble 
 maurice ... i didn’t <unk> so sorry <unk> me : nah don’t worry about it you go ahead and enjoy your new truck now 
 poor boy wanted to cry i was grinning from ear to ear 
 got into my office called in the sales person his manager and even finance who this guy also treated like shit and called up my younger brother tony ... allen really enjoyed his new promotion and used the bonus to pay off his house and put a massive down payment on his first rental property 
 <unk> : i tried to clean it up i 'm a pretty shitty writer 
 saw this and thought it belonged here 
 seems more professional than petty to me but hey ... & gt – <unk> 1 day <unk> registered nurse here : my manager does n't do a good job of being <unk> and comes across very robotic 
 its difficult for me because my <unk> drive does n't respond well to criticism even of the constructive type which she does n't usually provide she 's more a negative criticism type of manager 
 i received an e-mail from her on my day off full of passive aggressive bullshit about how i had made a mistake 
 a <unk> had wanted a patient to go for a test and the patient needed to follow certain instructions : take this medicine the night before then nothing by mouth after midnight type of instructions 
 the order went in at 10pm i work <unk> 
 the nurse coming on for the night shift did n't communicate with the patient that they were n't supposed to <unk> after midnight and the test was unable to take place 
 i did n't recognize the name of the patient in the e-mail and went back and checked the patient assignments for that particular day 
 as it turns out i was n't the nurse taking care of that patient 
 my day off had been ruined by thinking i had screwed up when i was n't even involved 
 i sent her an response letting her know that i had nothing to do with the care of that patient 
 i also informed her that it was a direct violation of that patients hipaa rights private health <unk> act for her to have shared with me a person who had absolutely nothing to do with the patients care both the patients name what he was being seen in the hospital for and specific details about the tests that were going to be <unk> on him 
 i told her i <unk> had an obligation to report the incident to medical records because a breach of privacy had occurred and included a screenshot from the mandatory bullshit training we do online every year about <unk> private health information 
 preface - i read this on a russian forum and i 'm translating it here 
 i have no way to verify whether this is true or not but the forum is somewhat <unk> and the revenge is amazing 
 for a bit of context the russian military has special days for different branches of service where <unk> of those branches get shitfaced and act like idiots 
 there are border guards day <unk> day paratrooper day and a few others 
 here 's the actual story 
 once upon a time on august 2nd a sad story took place in our town 
 3 drunken paratroopers ganged up on a middle-aged <unk> man called him slurs and beat him up 
 the paratroopers made a mistake 
 <unk> <unk> is n't a <unk> '' a racist slur but a <unk> and a well-connected man 
 he 's well respected enough and well-connected enough to have the 3 <unk> <unk> his shoes clean the next day 
 but uncle <unk> as everyone calls him is a kind man 
 they 'll punish themselves he said 
 all it took is a few meetings some phone calls and a bit of money relatively and next year ... next year on august 1st a new brand of vodka was delivered to all stores in the town 
 it was called paratrooper it was very cheap and had a label with an image of a paratrooper smashing a bottle over his head as is tradition - you 've seen the <unk> 
 the next day over 200 idiots were <unk> on paratrooper day some with <unk> some with <unk> trauma and <unk> from trying to break the bottle over their heads 
 the bottles were made of thick tempered glass 
 this whole things started like 12 years ago i’m 25 right now 
 back then i was kind of the kid who was bullied by the <unk> <unk> 
 i never had the best grades but never had much friends maybe i just wore the wrong clothes i don’t know 
 there was one guy especially who never let a day pass without insulting me until he left the school for what ever reason 
 some years later i was 20 at that point 
 i managed to finish school and worked for an design agency as an intern 
 everyday we get a lot of stuff via parcel service 
 basically we design stuff for clients and let it produce by what ever company gives us the best offer 
 all this stuff comes to us first so we can take a look at the quality and send in to our customer 
 this stuff can be heavy 
 our rooms are located in the second floor so it’s standard procedure that the parcel guy rings the bell and one of the interns goes down opens the door and help the <unk> guy to bring the stuff all the way up 
 time goes by and every time the parcel guy rings the bell i went downstairs to help him carry that stuff up 
 until one day 
 i opened the door and there he stands 
 this waste of organs an blood who never let a day pass without making my life hell back in school 
 he looked at me without <unk> who i am telling me he has some stuff for us and if i mind helping him to bring the stuff upstairs 
 i signed and instead of helping him bringing this two dozen packages of ordered paper blocks upstairs and believe me paper can be fucking heavy i just told him the way stepping outside and lit a cigarette while telling him where he should carry all this shit 
 he was not really happy to do all this on his own 
 after delivering the last package he passed me standing outside while smoking my third cigarette in a row normally i don’t smoke that much but i had to look cool : d just waiting for that moment when he passes me to go back to his car 
 the moment he passed me i said : <unk> you don’t remember but karma <unk> 
 he turns around and looked me straight in the eyes and in this one moment i could see in his eyes that he recognized me 
 he walked straight to his car without saying a word 
 after that i saw him every other day since 
 and when ever he is the guy who delivers all that stuff for us i stand outside and smoking a cigarette 
 this went on for another two years 
 he never changed a word with me nor did he looked me in the eyes 
 since than i’m working there full-time and we have another interns 
 the first thing i teach them whenever this one guy rings the bell to bring us our delivery don’t even think about helping him just sit outside and watch 
 sorry for my english <unk> not a native speaker hope you enjoyed this anyways this took place over a decade ago but after discovering this <unk> of a subreddit i needed to share 
 growing up my friends were all about <unk> houses 
 this involves throwing toilet paper over the house bushes trees etc 
 although we thought this was fun even at the age of 16 we knew there were <unk> as to how often you should do this because even though the joke is on the friend the parents are the ones dealing with the mess 
 so we had a rule : one person can get tp’d once a summer no exceptions 
 if you were caught you were required to help pick it up 
 that being said one <unk> didn’t respect the rule 
 for an entire summer my parent’s house was tp’d literally every weekend over the summer without fail 
 i didn’t know who was doing it or who to trust until i came home late one night to see my <unk> brother we’ll call him bb driving off in his car flipping me the bird 
 after calling him out on it he openly and happily admitted he was the culprit of the <unk> mystery tp asshole 
 bb did not like me and i did not like him 
 he stole my ex-girlfriend 
 he would shoot me with a paintball gun when i rolled up to his parent’s house 
 he thought smacking someone in the nuts was a good time 
 put simply we was a dick in every sense of the word 
 bb had one thing he loved more than anything even more than <unk> his dick on your face while you slept 
 his obsession was his red 1998 ford <unk> <unk> mustang 
 this car was his baby and his obsession 
 if he wasn’t busy degrading someone’s existence he was in the garage spending his parents money on his car 
 when he admitted to pounding my house with tp he was happy to announce he was doing it to my best friend’s house regularly we’ll call him bff 
 bff and i ended up telling our parents about it they are friends 
 when my dad found out he handed me his costco card and <unk> dad handed him a $ 100 bill and he said <unk> what needs to be <unk> 
 we bought 10 pounds of <unk> two costco sized bags of tp and a thing called <unk> sewer bait – the worst smelling substance in the world 
 100 % honest : i would rather eat a spoonful of shit than eat a spoonful of that 
 one afternoon i ended up going to <unk> house to hang with his brother 
 when i was alone i <unk> a pair of keys to his brothers car they hung them inside the door 
 we snuck back to his house that night and here’s what we did : 1 
 at least 4 pound of flower was poured through via a <unk> into the air vents 
 no idea how that <unk> out 
 2 
 the sewer bait was put in the section of the car that <unk> came into for ac and heat don’t ask me how that was bff who pulled that off 
 the smell was enough to make my buddy puke 
 3 
 we tp’d the shit out of his house 
 i mean <unk> the house the back garage the pond out front the trees surrounding their house and the trees in the yard 
 if it would hold tp we put it <unk> 2 costco sized bags of double rolled tp 
 that night it rained and the tp became <unk> 
 as for the car my buddy told me that his brother bb sold it after bringing it to the dealership multiple times to get it fixed 
 he sold the car for about <unk> it’s worth and was forced to drive his <unk> buick 
 in hindsight i was a huge <unk> but when you’re in rome do as the <unk> do 
 tl dr : my buddy has a brother that is an ass and i made his car smell like <unk> ex : ex wife was <unk> abusive to me and the kids was a <unk> liar and <unk> and did all she could to ruin me financially during and after the marriage 
 she also tried <unk> hard and was successful for a few years at turning the kids against me 
 she was and still is a nasty hypocrite 
 the back story : while married to her she was in the hospital for a minor accident and while in the hospital she asked me to help her out of bed so she could look in the mirror to see if she had bruises on her face from the minor accident 
 i helped her out of bed and while at the mirror and in front of the sink she fainted and fell before i could catch her 
 she hit her head on the sink and the fall broke her wrist when she landed on it 
 i called the nurse and <unk> they <unk> up her lip and set her wrist 
 a year or so later she contacted a lawyer to sue the hospital 
 meanwhile we get divorced 
 the divorce is nasty and she is nasty 
 she tries to get me arrested many times when i try to see the kids on scheduled times 
 she contacted all of my friends and tried to turn them away from me 
 she <unk> my parents and sisters first trying to be their <unk> and try to turn them against me and when that did n't work she attacked them with nasty phone calls and <unk> accusations 
 meanwhile her malpractice suit is proceeding and her lawyer wanted me to give a deposition to support it 
 i agree but on the condition that they have to pay me for my time and costs 
 the revenge : at the deposition i was supposed to support their claim that the ex was not given <unk> about staying in bed and that the <unk> were not put up as a reminder for her to stay in bed and that <unk> it was the hospital 's fault that she was able to get up and then faint and fall 
 i said that i did n't remember any of that that she demanded that she get up and that i help her and that we were not going to wait for the nurse to help 
 in my deposition i told the truth as i remembered it 
 my memory did not support her malpractice claim 
 afterwards her lawyer dropped her case based on my deposition and tried to hit her up for costs but she screwed him like she did everyone else 
 **tl : dr my deposition <unk> her malpractice claim 
 <unk> dad is a pretty lovely honest guy but looks like a complete criminal and has a vein of <unk> in him that he <unk> with age and in general has a do n't fuck with me <unk> i picked up on since i was in elementary school 
 i thought you 'd like a few stories of the kind of revenge he got when he was younger and less ... responsible 
 stories come from him my mother and grandmother 
 this one is my favourite : back when military was <unk> in my country my dad like everyone else had to serve at 18. so he gets called up in this base very far away from home 
 he is the only one there not from the area he looks different has a different accent does n't know anyone is very young 
 so people start fucking with him 
 this one bully in particular really starts getting on his nerves 
 so one night when they are in the massive '' bedroom with most beds and this guy is bullying my dad with his friends my dad goes up to this guy really close to his face and tells him next time you pull this shit again i will set you on fire '' 
 they start laughing at him and making even more fun of him 
 day after it 's <unk> again 
 this guy waits for my dad to fall asleep and teabags him 
 my dad wakes up 
 everyone is in tears from laughing 
 my dad calmly lights up a cigarette 
 then he reaches for something 
 he was storing some gasoline 
 the guy went to sit on his bed in the meanwhile 
 my dad throws a bunch of gasoline on top of him while he starts freaking out 
 throws the cigarette on him 
 guy goes on fire they manage to stop it before it gets too dangerous he still gets some burns 
 everyone was so freaked out they claimed it was an accident too afraid to tell on my dad 
 had no problems after that 
 another time he was with my mom at the beach they were pretty young 19 or 20 
 it was the 2 of them 
 my dad was trying to get some sleep my mom was <unk> 
 a group of guys walk past and one of them slaps my mom 's ass 
 like my dad was n't there 
 guy tells my dad what you gon na do about it '' 
 i guess they felt there was safety in numbers 
 my dad does n't say a word 
 he gets up takes the metal tube <unk> out of the sand and starts beating the <unk> fuck out of that guy until he is half passed out 
 he then stares down his friends until they leave 
 another time back when he was in school the <unk> son was a real dickhead always bullying smaller weaker younger kids 
 my dad could n't take his shit he 's always hated injustice 
 so one day while this kid who felt like god was bullying some poor little kid my dad went up to him and told him to stop 
 the kid ignored him 
 my dad told him if you are so brave why do n't you come and do that with someone your own size '' 
 the kid just laughed at him and told him to mind his own fucking business if he didnt want him to tell his dad '' 
 the kid kept berating the other smaller child who was almost in tears 
 so my dad went up to the kid pushed him on the ground and started kicking him 
 after the kid looked pretty hurt my dad got him in a lock and started slapping his butt infront of everyone and told him go on tell your dad call your dad '' 
 the kid started screaming <unk> come <unk> '' like a <unk> until a teacher did call the principal 
 he came and got my dad off his son and called my grandma into school 
 so the kid told his story highly skewed 
 my dad kept cool and told what actually happened 
 the principal was furious 
 this was back in the day when stuff like this would get you a small suspension at most 
 my dad told how everything went 
 to which my grandma told the principal : i know my son 
 he is not a <unk> and absolutely not a bully 
 your son had it coming 
 tell him to learn how to behave because my son wo n't tolerate that kind of behaviour and i fully support him '' 
 my badass grandma then just went home with my dad and told him to make sure there are no witnesses next time he kicks his ass 
 i am not nearly as interesting but i figured you 'd like some of my old man stories : d this happened to my uncle recently 
 he was crossing the road taking his young sons home from their music lesson when an <unk> driver almost ran over the first son 
 as the driver got out of his car my uncle proceeded to give the driver a piece of his mind to which the driver responded by <unk> and <unk> at my uncle and his son 
 rather than escalating further my uncle took note of the driver 's work uniform and after the driver went on his way my uncle went to the driver 's workplace informed his employers who informed my uncle that he would be fired in the morning who was already on his last legs so i got a call from my boyfriend who seemed really upset after <unk> a class at his college 
 he <unk> it by telling me that he almost killed a man today 
 i laughed it off because he is too sweet and could never hurt anybody 
 it turns out that he was in a class in which a <unk> <unk> from texas referred to as craig was spewing his <unk> that west african people who are suffering from the <unk> outbreak deserve their fate 
 craig honestly believed that those countries deserved the virus because <unk> can’t care for their <unk> as fate would have it my boyfriend being from guinea was very shocked that anybody could say those beliefs and write off a group of people especially people craig did not know 
 my boyfriend is not mean or spiteful and literally has never even killed a spider in my presence 
 i think this hurt him a lot more than he was willing to admit 
 he told me that he wanted to say something to the professor and classmates but the moment passed 
 the class was then grouped off to discuss something 
 craig was paired off with a girl but she refused to be in his group she was from <unk> <unk> 
 my boyfriend walked over to be partners with him 
 at introduction my boyfriend reached out and firmly grabbed craig’s hand and continued to hold it 
 my boyfriend then looked deep into craig’s eyes and said “i’m from guinea ” and <unk> 
 seeing no recognition in craig’s eyes my boyfriend added with a smile <unk> is in west africa 
 i have been in america for 3 <unk> but in fact he has been here for over a year 
 craig didn’t need to know that though 
 craig started freaking out 
 he sat down and my boyfriend could see this young man visibly shaking and sweat pouring out of him 
 the class stopped what they were doing and stared at craig and my boyfriend 
 they asked what happen and my boyfriend told them that he did n't know 
 now he is afraid that he is going to get in trouble for lying 
 he said he felt like he almost gave craig a heart attack 
 but i had to share this it is too great 
 i created this account just to tell this story 
 i know he won’t get in trouble 
 <unk> my boyfriend is seriously considering not going to class next monday because he is certain that he is going to get harassed 
 i 'm secretly hoping he does n't go so it will make craig think he died 
 i do n't yell at my students i say good morning '' remember names and <unk> <unk> i 'm there after school for two hours every day i answer their questions to the best of my ability i offer them musical <unk> i gave them free fridays of cartoons and snacks for high test <unk> and good behaviour 
 i started started a little band that played during parent nights 
 i was even the musician at one of my student 's mother 's funeral 
 that week i have no idea how they <unk> 
 no one wanted to tell who did what so i treated them as a group 
 edit : the word revenge 
 i did n't mean it as a super villain picking on <unk> or <unk> parties 
 i 'm not the best with words but i felt there had to be some form of <unk> 
 a multiple choice test and extra projects to raise grades 
 that 's not evil 
 i 'm not spanking children here 
 i a high school music <unk> choir direct am fed up with my classes 
 i took a short vacation came back to a nasty letter from my sub 
 someone spilled apple juice on my piano and ruined a few <unk> 
 the glass for my favourite framed drawing was cracked 
 two chairs broke 
 my <unk> is missing a string 
 and most of them did n't do the <unk> i left behind 
 final exams are around the corner so i decided to get revenge with my test 
 i know that sounds awful but i believe my music students do n't deserve to get off easy 
 i 'm planning a <unk> exam which must be done in one class period 
 no study guide will be given as the exam will cover what i 've taught since the first week of school 
 i have <unk> students in all so i decided to create three questions per student 
 however i will <unk> the questions so that no two students will have the same test 
 questions wo n't be too easy to answer either 
 not only a test but homework assignments every night until the end of the school year 
 then on top of that they 'll have to create a <unk> <unk> 
 i 'm pretty sure they 've experienced harder teachers than me but all i ask is for a little respect here and there 
 i live in a state with constant <unk> efforts as a result of our <unk> citizen initiative system 
 most signature <unk> are pushy but in an accustomed sort of way 
 you see one ahead you drop your shades <unk> a phone call anything to avoid them 
 for the most part they <unk> but not this one time ... my kids and i were downtown walking from the bus stop to one of the <unk> that typically host popular kids <unk> 
 it was a nice night and we were having a good time 
 <unk> a large public plaza i spy a chubby middle-aged male signature <unk> standing near the corner ahead 
 the gods of timing are not with us and we are stopped by the 'do n't walk sign 
 this is clearly his method : the <unk> audience 
 in all honesty i ca n't blame him 
 we 'd be stuck at the crosswalk with him for 20s no more 
 as soon as we stop he launches into his spiel 
 after a moment or two i politely tell him not tonight man '' and return my attention to my kids 
 he immediately replies no tonight '' and <unk> me in the chest with the clipboard 
 <unk> 
 i am what <unk> the <unk> called a <unk> man 
 nobody 's going to try and make me look like a <unk> let alone in front of my kids 
 my first reaction upon being poked in the chest by this tool was to slap the clipboard out of his fat little hands 
 however to do so would be to set what i knew to be an inappropriately violent & amp <unk> personal standard for public behavior for my kids so in the words of <unk> juice '' jones instead i chilled 
 i did however happen to have a black <unk> in the leg pocket of my <unk> 
 i looked the offending <unk> in the eye and said sure i 'll sign 
 give it to me '' 
 rather than use the <unk> attached to the clipboard by a <unk> array of <unk> rubber bands i opted for my own pen found the first open signature blank and wrote fuck you '' in giant black letters the length of the signature entry 
 the whole episode had eaten up our wait time at this point 
 the moment the walk signal turned i handed the clipboard back to mr. pushy & amp stepped into the crosswalk 
 talking and laughing with my kids i never looked back and they were never aware of the time their dad rolled some instant karma on a douchebag who tried to harsh the family buzz 
 ed : to <unk> the enemy without fighting is the <unk> of skill '' 
 -sun <unk> person 's mailbox story reminded me of this one 
 when i was in highschool a friend of mine was dating this sweet little girl that we all got along with 
 but this girl had an ex boyfriend who was a real piece of shit 
 threatened to beat my friend 's ass a couple times never followed through harassed her told everyone she had laid down with him and other stuff 
 just an all around dick 
 the girl did a great job of ignoring his bullshit which pissed him off even more 
 well one day her family comes out of their house and sees their mailbox has been ran down and someone had driven across their lawn 
 her dad righted it and straightened it out just for it to be ran down again a few days late 
 everyone assumed it was scumbag but there was no proof to be had 
 scumbag had made one error in judgement though 
 and that was the girl 's dad was a retired <unk> with nothing but time on his hands 
 this man spent hours building this beautiful mailbox out of 1/2 steel sheets 
 he then <unk> it on a steel pole filled with concrete and painted the whole thing red and black to <unk> the monstrosity it really was 
 a week went by with no progress and we were <unk> that maybe scumbag had given it up 
 but then one late night the family is woken up to a smash outside 
 scumbag had slammed into it again and the mailbox had gone clear through the <unk> of his truck 
 end game is scumbag is arrested for dui underage drinking and i am sure a whole list of other shit 
 two jackasses with him are charged too 
 mailbox just had to be straightened out and repainted and was still in service when i left town a few years later 
 i used to do freelance translating work a few years ago and i finished a project for <unk> word technical manual for an indian client that had good reviews on their industry profile proz 
 now normally payment for freelance <unk> can range between 30 to 60 days and under my contract they had 60 days to pay for the amount 
 fast forward to <unk> day since i delivered the project and i did n't hear anything from them 
 after multiple phone calls e-mails and skype messages i received no word from the client so i decided to give up write a negative review on proz and move on 
 after about 6 months i get an e-mail from the same company asking me to complete another translation project i guess they had forgotten about me 
 now here 's an opportunity '' i thought 
 i took on the assignment completed it on time except when it was time to send in the assignment i did n't and waited 
 surely enough a couple hours from the deadline the translation company was frantically trying to reach me sending multiple e-mails and even going so far as trying to call my american number 
 they were freaking out because the project was due for their client on that very same day and if they did n't get it they would lose their business with them 
 i gladly responded saying that hey remember that <unk> you stood up 6 months ago yeah that 's me 
 i have your project ready to go but you need to pay me for my previous work plus interest as well as for this assignment before you get this project '' 
 and what do you know the money was in my account half an hour <unk> understand db you might want to check out he is a super huge <unk> person 
 one of my friends had to have an abortion because either she or the child would die 
 db found out and told her she is going to hell and will meet her baby there 
 he also went out and harassed her husband saying that he should not have let her have an abortion 
 it is up to the man of the house to lay down the law 
 super douchey 
 lets go back in time to 2009. this was a time before db showed his true colors 
 i was chatting with db on facebook and we go to talking about sex 
 i said i was in quite a <unk> '' 
 5 minutes later db shows up at my apartment and we ... .. you know ... cut to about 4 weeks later i had an cut the tip of my finger off while making a <unk> 
 it was a holiday weekend and pretty much everyone i knew was out of town 
 my mom was in europe sister in a different state about 20 of my friends were on a vacation together i had to stay home and work : i could not drive to the hospital 
 i was seeing spots and feeling like i was going to throw up 
 i call db and he does n't answer 
 fine whatever 
 then i hear a <unk> 
 he sent me a text 
 it said you are my whore 
 not the other way around 
 you do n't get to decide when we bang '' ... ... wtf 
 i needed a ride to the hospital 
 not a ride on his penis 
 whatever 
 i end up calling 911 and getting a nice expensive ride to the hospital 
 yay for ambulances 
 now lets travel back to 2014. i write db an email 
 i say that i am trying to have a closer relationship with god which is a lie 
 i need to tell him something so i can be closer with our <unk> father 
 i tell him that when we hooked up years ago i got pregnant 
 i called him on that holiday weekend because i did not know if i should get an abortion or not 
 when he did n't pick up the phone i thought that he did not care for our <unk> child 
 i had an abortion and killed our child because i could not get ahold of you 
 he read it and calls me crying 
 how could he let me kill our child 
 why did n't he do anything 
 and i be like - i 'll preface this by saying that i am a <unk> <unk> in recovery 
 i 'm not proud of the things i did but i got a kick out of this at the time 
 a couple years ago i was out driving around doing my thing i had just scored some excellent black <unk> from my dealer 
 i decided to call my buddy we can call him jay to hang out and get high with me 
 so i went to go meet him in the parking lot of some scummy mexican restaurant in central phoenix 
 i pull in and notice that he had someone else with him so i drove up to them and he insists that this kid needed to come too and i mean kid this little prick looked like he had just gotten out of middle school 
 we 'll call him chris 
 chris had some meth on him and at the time i was n't at all <unk> opposed to <unk> hardcore drug <unk> among minors so i figured why not 
 after a grimy session of <unk> i dropped them both off at chris moms house 
 when i was pulling into chris street i took note of a comment he made about how he had stolen several hundred dollars worth of copper wire from his stepfather who was an electrician a few days prior 
 about two weeks later i encountered the dreaded <unk> event that took place in my <unk> life style : my dealer was n't responding to my texts 
 i called jay and he said i should send chris a facebook message he did n't have a phone he was using an ipod touch to communicate 
 apparently chris had a dealer that lived a few blocks from his moms house 
 desperate as fuck to not be <unk> in the pain of <unk> <unk> i caved in to my <unk> and decided to meet chris at a gas station near his moms house 
 long story short this little piece of shit ran off with my $ 50 
 but he was coming right back '' 
 lol 
 it was n't entirely unexpected but you 'd think that as a 21 year old 170 pound guy that knows where you live it would be safer just to take the <unk> fee 
 apparently he forgot that i knew where he lived because he did n't respond to any of my facebook messages for 45 minutes until i typed in the name of his street and told him i 'll see him in a few minutes 
 he typed me this bullshit story about how he got robbed and that he would pay me back in a couple days 
 i 'm generally a nice guy and i 'd rather avoid conflict especially with a 15 year old kid so i agreed 
 a few days went by and no word from him i messaged him about it but i did n't get a response 
 i was just going to drop it until jay told me the kid was bragging about stealing my money 
 this is the point that i realized i must have my revenge 
 i drove over to his moms house and knocked on the door 
 a middle-aged woman answered obviously startled by my <unk> appearance yet <unk> asked can i help you '' 
 i replied yes are you chris mom '' 
 she looked incredibly worried and confirmed that she was indeed the <unk> unit of this little hellspawn 
 i straightened my <unk> and put on my best 'concerned parent face and said i 'm the brother of one of his friends 
 i recently discovered that your son and my brother have been using crystal meth together and i 'm very concerned about the both of them 
 i did n't know if you knew or not by this time she looked like she was about to shit a brick but i thought i 'd at least try to let you guys know so you can get him some help '' 
 she welcomed me inside for coffee chris was n't home and i suggested that she check chris for needle marks and gave her details about how he had stolen the copper wire from her husband 's work van 
 i heard from jay the next day that chris was being shipped off to florida for some sort of long-term <unk> treatment program 
 peace out fucker 
 i 'm here to talk about the battle for my small community park 
 this <unk> involves a large community and parent group and a bigoted protester who we shall call pm park man 
 & amp nbsp every morning on weekdays pm parks his pickup truck with a massive home made sign on the back right on the side of one of my town 's busiest roads and most popular park - just to ensure his ideologies are spread - until late into the evening 
 now there is nothing wrong with spreading your own message but park man took it to the extreme and eventually the town snapped 
 pm started his campaign a while ago when obama was first <unk> 
 he started off <unk> signs with the usual obama is an illegal president he is trying to take over the nation etc '' 
 of course there is nothing wrong with spreading your own political views but pm realized that posting his political views was not simply enough to get the public attention and decided to escalate 
 he began to <unk> his sign with much more <unk> much more racist messages such as <unk> will all go to hell obama is the devil and <unk> is a <unk> '' 
 during my towns gay pride parade pm sat on a street corner and <unk> bullshit out of his mouth for hours calling the <unk> <unk> and <unk> them to hell 
 recently he drew the last straw by flying blown up images of <unk> fetuses for everyone - including children playing in the park to see 
 & amp nbsp now if pm was protesting in the deep south he might have been okay but my town <unk> is extremely liberal peaceful and <unk> of pretty much anything except extreme <unk> <unk> and violence 
 furthermore many parents stopped taking their kids to the park to avoid the racist messages and sometimes graphic images on the sidewalk 20 feet away 
 despite being extremely offensive everything pm does is protected by his right to free speech so the recent protests and <unk> started by the community to <unk> him meant nothing 
 and so pm persisted and even gained a small group of supporters 
 & amp nbsp something needed to be done and the community came up with a beautifully simple solution 
 they realized that all though pm was protected by free speech the parking spot pm used for his billboard was not 
 for the past couple of weeks a big group of concerned parents and other community members wake up early and snag all of the parking lots by the park and then leave when the park closes 
 people working on nearby shops now leave their cars by the park and walk to work and some parents spend the whole day at the park with their cars in pm 's beloved parking space <unk> peace and tolerance 
 for the past two weeks the park has been free from pm 's truck his signs and the his small group of followers making my town just a little bit better 
 & amp nbsp tldr : extremely racist man 's right to free speech is protected but his right to a parking space is not 
 & amp nbsp edit : maybe i will post this on /r/pettyrevenge i suck at finding <unk> and i thought this was the place 
 i also found some videos and articles but they directly name pm so idk if i should post <unk> : late 70 's place : a medium size midwestern town players : me an electrical contractor and guido the hot shot from new york city 
 probably <unk> but who cares 
 set up : guido has shown up in town and announces he going to open up the first disco in town 
 he 's flying on borrowed money spends a ton on advertising and promotion rents a big space in a big strip mall and proceeds to hire local contractors to build his disco 
 i come in with a 4 man crew to do all his electrical 
 it takes two weeks and then some because he keeps asking for more stuff and i oblige 
 come payday two days before his grand opening i come in with an invoice for ~ $ <unk> expecting payment in full 
 we sit down at a table he and i along with some 200 lbs <unk> who is a local i recognize 
 he offers me $ 350 cash for the whole job 
 he argues that we did n't have anything on paper so i could take it or leave it 
 i think about it for a minute and decide to accept so he gets up to go fetch the cash 
 while he 's gone i look over at <unk> with a questioning look and as if he knows what i 'm going to ask he said yes i 'm here to keep you from beating his ass '' 
 he <unk> volunteered that i was n't the only one 
 i collect the $ 350 and leave 
 opening night the parking lot is filling up there 's a line at the door and guido is up front collecting his door $ 10 a head and i pull up in my 1 ton all the way around by the back door 
 i rig a chain and a <unk> on the back door so he ca n't come out the back wrap a 1 '' <unk> rope around the riser on his service tie the other end to my back bumper and jerk his meter clean off the wall making a huge shower of sparks buzzing and pops then calmly drive back around front and park at a fair distance from the front door 
 after a minute or two of silence and darkness from the club people start spilling out demanding refunds 
 apparently he was n't interested in giving out refunds so after a few more minutes i saw 6 or 7 <unk> up rednecks drag him into the parking lot and beat the crap out of him empty his pockets and leave him laying there on the curb 
 he left town inside of 24 hours 
 but wait 
 there 's more 
 in a similar incident a couple of years later i got stiffed by a shitty biker bar for a couple of service calls 
 not that much money or as big a deal but they threw a beer bottle at my van as i was driving away and the <unk> just set me off 
 i came back at <unk> on a friday night about a week later parked on the other side of the shopping center set up a ladder and carried my wire <unk> across the roof and <unk> their power lines right at the weatherhead and left 
 they called the power company who came out found the <unk> sticking out of the weatherhead too short to connect to and told them they needed an electrician to come replace their riser before they could <unk> 
 ever try to find an electrician on a friday night 
 or a saturday or sunday 
 lol it took until monday before the lights and coolers were back on 
 i toasted about $ 400 worth of beer in their coolers plus their whole weekend take 
 moral of the story : do <unk> fuck with your electrician 
 ps : just for <unk> i did n't have this kind of problem very often 
 i made most of my money off oil fields and only ran service calls to keep a <unk> combo <unk> heard this one from a friend of mine who is a trucker 
 although i ca n't prove that it is true the guy is an honest friend and has n't made any shit up during the time i 've known him 
 anyway i figured i 'd post it here 
 he was sitting in a long traffic jam on <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk> after drinking a lot of <unk> 
 since the traffic was at a dead stop and he had to pee he took a ziplock <unk> from the back of his sleeper cab and emptied his entire <unk> into it 
 he <unk> it up and got back into the driver 's seat 
 fast forward about 20 minutes : he still has n't made any progress but his cb radio started going crazy 
 anybody who has a driver 's license has probably witnessed the self entitled assholes who drive on the shoulder of the interstate in order to get in front of traffic 
 by doing this they are frequently blocking the only emergency access to the wreck 
 these people piss me off as well as every trucker sitting in traffic 
 so he was hearing reports of 2 mustangs riding with the tops down with a bunch of frat douches coming up the shoulder at about 50 mph 
 he had a brilliant idea 
 remember the ziplock bag of piss 
 he got into the passenger seat of the truck rolled down the window and waited until the mustangs were in clear view 
 as they reached his truck he threw the bag of piss out the window 
 it slammed into the windshield of the first mustang spraying his trucker piss all over the frat douche passengers 
 they then proceeded to take the next exit ... hopefully to clean off all of the piss that had just coated them 
 he got a round of cheers on the cb radio that day 
 edit : my <unk> is <unk> mom brother and i lived in a tiny shitty rented apartment owned by her half sister 
 in the beginning she knew we were looking for a place to stay and begged for us to rent her unit because she needed the money desperately 
 this aunt is not close to us barely meet in 18 years she lives at her daughter 's place and allowed us to rent the whole unit and considering she 's a family member it 's a good deal we thought 
 we only had to pay the rental and deposit or some shit for in the situation of if we move out without notice 
 on one of those months aunt could n't afford to pay the utility bills for <unk> maintenance etc and my mom offered to help for that one particular month only even though it was n't part of the rental agreement 
 but the following month when utility was behind on payment again aunt gave mom a stern warning telling her to pay on time 
 she somehow automatically assumes mom will pay it each month for her just because she did it as a favour once 
 this means mom will have to pay like an extra $ 100 on top of the rental cost each month but she 's a nice person she did n't mind and wanted to help out my aunt thinking she 's having financial <unk> and plus she 's a family member we can not say no or else word will spread 
 in my country the government will give rebates once every year in the form of something like $ 200 voucher to be used to pay the light and water bills 
 bare in mind it 's just a piece of paper it 's just a voucher that minus $ 200 from the bills you dont see the money 
 every single 21 and above citizen will receive this for their household but if you do n't have a house you simply do n't need to use it 
 but aunt texted my mom and asked for it in cash 
 she said since you do n't need the voucher and its my house give me the money '' it 's ridiculous because the government gives this to everyone and it 's just a voucher to cut down the bills how can she ask for ours in cash 
 her logic was that the rebates are to be used if you have a house and considering we live in her house she thinks it 's rightfully hers 
 she said she needed the money to celebrate eid <unk> but we are a muslim family too we needed the money to celebrate eid too 
 again mom was pissed but too nice to say anything and gave her the $ 200 she think she 's entitled to 
 she 's a relative and we did n't want issues 
 the next year when the government gave the same rebate aunt asked for the same thing but including the amount of the voucher my brother and i received 
 so mom got incredibly pissed and told my aunt off but aunt pretended she did n't know the voucher was just a paper and not cash 
 from this point on there was visible tension and she hated us because she knew she ca n't trick my mom into giving more money 
 for 3 years she continually try to suck more money out from us because she knows we rather pay extra than have to look for a new place 
 after 3 years since moving in one night we had the rest of the family over for dinner like 4 of them including my brother 's fiance sister and her husband who dont live with us and our family friend 
 after dinner we <unk> ourselves with the one finger lifting trick 
 it 's basically a party trick where one <unk> will lie flat on the floor and 4 people will lift the person up using one 1 finger each something to do with weight distribution 
 you can google it it 's a fun activity 
 basically we recorded ourselves doing it for shits and giggles and i posted the video on facebook 
 but my aunt found the video from a tip off by another relative and started commenting that we were having a disco '' and the doors and windows are open 
 you are letting the neighbours see and embarrassing us '' 
 1 whole day later she gave my mom an angry phone call which went like this aunt : do you know your daughter is on facebook '' 
 i was 20 years old at the time wtf '' 
 mom : yes i know '' aunt : do you know she has photos with her father '' 
 parents are divorce but she thinks im not suppose to talk to my dad and take photos with him mom : so '' 
 aunt : i saw the black magic video they are not suppose to do that in my house and its embarrassing me 
 are you aware of what they are doing '' 
 mom : yes so 
 i 've seen it '' 
 aunt : <unk> a muslim lady and you wear a <unk> over your head 
 how can you allow your daughter to dress like that 
 when she leaves the house the neighbours see and it 's embarrassing me '' mom then <unk> the phone 
 it 's really not her business in what i do or how i dress or whether or not i have contact with my father because this lady is just a distant relative 
 we simply rent her house that 's all she does not have any right to comment on my life 
 the night we had family over was just a small gathering and we were not being noisy 
 the end of the month mom did the usual thing and went to aunt 's place to pay for the rental and she along with her daughter gang up on my mom with some bullshit about having to sell the house we 're living in because the housing board changed some policy or method of payment which my aunt is not willing to do so they have to sell it in 3 months unless we can <unk> out more money to continue staying there 
 she told us to be gone by november too if we ca n't pay more 
 mom just smiled and said ok. we know it 's just bullshit and no such new policy they are just threatening to sell the house if we cant pay extra rent money 
 that week we packed up our shit and moved to my sister 's place 
 we did n't need to give her any notice or warning because she told us to be gone by november 
 after we moved she told my uncle that we owe her 3 months worth of rent payment til november which she feels entitled to because she thinks we are supposed to live there til november <unk> never mentioned it and only told us to leave as soon as we can 
 november was just a deadline she made but when we called her to verify this claim she said she owed us the deposit money instead which she must give back to us for making us leave 
 aunt was greedy 
 she was never going to sell the house 
 she simply did n't like us because we refuse to give her the government rebate and so she was tried to make us pay extra 
 she knew we were desperate for a house in the past and thought we were going to do anything and pay any amount to continue living in her shit house now 
 she never thought we were capable of moving out and we are her only source of income so she immediately regretted it and told my mom that they cancelled plans of selling the house and begged for mom to stay 
 so the revenge is this : we played by her rules but moved out without any hint or warning which means bitch aunt did n't realise she needed to start paying the house on her own and she couldnt because we are her only source of income she is heavily in debt now nobody wants to rent her apartment because it 's in such a shitty condition and on top of that she also have to pay us the deposit money back which she is struggling to do and has not fully pay back 2 years later 
 so i passed a guy going 60 mph in the left lane to get around him 
 this jerk turns on his brights and starts tailgating me for about 5 miles or so 
 eventually he cuts in front of me and starts going 60 mph again 
 i get into the right lane and speed up 
 the guy speeds up too this continues til we are both going about <unk> mph 
 i think to myself whatever i 'm going the speed i want to go '' 
 then <unk> informs me there is a cop car up ahead 
 i wait for a minute until i can see the cop 
 i hit the gas which in my car revs my engine loudly but does n't immediately cause a speed increase 
 jerk hits the gas too and since his car is nicer than mine immediately speeds up to about 110 mph 
 i slow down to the speed limit 
 110 mph is considered reckless driving in my state 
 can you guess what happened next 
 yup the <unk> turns his lights on and pulls <unk> mcgee over 
 enjoy your reckless driving charge hello 
 i 've recently graduated from college but have no job so i got an apartment at a shitty complex 
 now just because it 's a crappy complex does n't mean i should n't have a functioning apartment i do pay rent after all 
 i had been on the landlord 's case for about a month to fix my slow drains and <unk> electrical outlets in the apartment 
 when my toilet clogged things came to a head 
 i went down to the office to tell them about the toilet problem 
 while i was there i also complained about the slow sink and outlets again 
 they said it would be at least two weeks until someone would come fix my stuff 
 when i asked why it was going to take so long they said it was because maintenance was too busy turning over apartments for new tenants 
 that pissed me off pretty bad 
 so i decided to relieve them of any new tenants 
 maybe with no new tenants coming in they would have time to fix my apartment that i pay them good money for every month 
 so i went to the <unk> and i got one of those poster <unk> 
 it took me about fifteen minutes to make a poster that said in real big letters so-and-so is a deadbeat landlord '' 
 then i took my sign and stood on the sidewalk in front of their leasing office 
 i know i turned away at least 3 people who were seriously thinking about renting there 
 new tenants are so valuable to this company that they 'll take $ 500 off the rent of anyone who refers a new tenant 
 i stood out there for one full business day 
 the very next morning maintenance was banging down my door trying to fix shit for me 
 apparently the way to get stuff done around here is by cutting off the flow of new suckers 
 tl dr landlord flatly told me that my shit was n't getting fixed because they were too busy turning over apartments for new tenants 
 so i stood outside their leasing office with a sign that said so and so is a deadbeat landlord '' and turned away all the new tenants that came up 
 they quickly fixed my shit.i 'm not 100 % sure of the outcome of my revenge but just doing it made me feel good inside and i lol 'd at the thought from <unk> until weeks after i finished 
 here goes : one day a random guy starts calling/texting me saying dumb shit that does n't make sense 
 i hear laughter in the background 
 after this happens a few times i start to get annoyed ... it 's obvious that it 's <unk> and someone is fucking with me 
 later that day he starts sending weird pictures videos ... most of which i would have rather not seen and i 've seen some pretty sick shit 
 this goes on every few hours for two days sometimes at night 
 extremely annoying because i do n't fuck with anyone and i definitely do n't play phone games ... top three pet <unk> of mine 
 fucking <unk> 
 what to do 
 i do n't know the number so i <unk> it and find it 's a sprint number not <unk> 
 after doing research on reverse # <unk> i decide against it 
 i 'm not about to pay money to find out who 's calling me 
 i also do n't want to take the high route and just block the # ... i 've always been the bigger person but at this point i 'm beyond annoyed and feeling super petty so fuck that 
 i think for a while and decide instead to create a fake backpage ad offering sexual services for dirt cheap prices in <unk> ms chose it at random using this fuck boy 's # as the contact 
 i wait and post it around 12am in hopes that they 'd get several calls from johns until 5 or 6 in the morning asking for $ 20 top '' 
 the <unk> messages stopped after that 
 but i was n't finished 
 i continued this shit for a week posting ads in a different <unk> each night to really fuck with him 
 i would also post ads in this ts section and asked would be johns to send freak nasty dick pics asap '' in the post description 
 as stated above not sure if all my hard work went unnoticed as they probably changed the number after day 1 or 2 and i never tried to call to make sure it was still active 
 but just the thought of that asshole getting dozens of unsolicited calls/texts for sex for a week straight made it worth it 
 **edit** : a few people have commented on how this was n't pro level and i actually agree with them 
 i initially tried to post this in /r/pettyrevenge yesterday but it would not take 
 that being said this was n't a breeze to pull off 
 it 's actually harder than you think to post suspect content on craigslist / backpage 
 specifically craigslist ... that 's the site i initially tried but their <unk> or mods would flag the post for <unk> and have it removed within minutes 
 after trying this a few times i switched to backpage 
 also the circumstances surrounding my revenge are different from most 
 from what i can see most <unk> to this sub detail face-to-face <unk> like : the guy on floor 4 said a b c ... my sister-in-law did x y <unk> ... my boss was a dick ... you get it 
 i did n't have that <unk> only a phone number 
 in this case there 's not much revenge you can exact outside of petty <unk> 
 i was n't about to spend weeks / months planning this but trust when i say i lost my fair share of sleep plotting and carrying this thing out 
 **edit 2** : i 'd also like to make this clear : neither my revenge nor this post is a swipe at ts or prostitutes 
 people have the right to lead whatever lifestyle they choose 
 as long as their decisions are n't hurting others we should respect them 
 please do n't use this post as an excuse to shit on others 
 **tl dr** : random guy starts calling/texting saying stupid things and sending weird photos and videos for two days straight 
 i make a fake backpage ad offering sexual services and put his # as the contact asking johns to send nasty dick pics '' 
 the calls stop but i continue posting ads for a week to really leave my mark 
 i post several ads in the ts section as <unk> took a <unk> literature course my sophomore year of college and ended up with this english professor who had a very low opinion of teaching undergrad gen ed courses 
 we were reading <unk> dick one of my favorite books and in classic nerd style i spent all quarter working on the paper 
 i was very happy with how it turned out but when i got it back she had given me an f and had just written see me '' 
 on it 
 i went to see her and she said these ideas are too <unk> for a college sophomore to have come up with 
 it had to have been <unk> 
 i brought in all of my notes <unk> previous <unk> - it was obviously my work 
 she said - find but it is still an f paper because it is terrible 
 she gave me a chance to <unk> my grade '' by <unk> it 
 the paper was typed this was in the 80s - no computers so i <unk> the paper word for word in blue ink and went back to her office hours 
 she told me she could tell i had really worked on the paper '' and gave the paper a c. then she sent me home to rewrite it again 
 i <unk> the paper word for word this time in black ink and brought it back and she begrudgingly gave me an a. i have her a nice big smile thanked her for her time and then went right to the chair of the department with all of the papers 
 long story short she was put on probation and had to have the chair sign off on her paper grades to ensure that she was being <unk> 
 tldr : english prof gave me 4 different <unk> for the same paper - ended up being <unk> for failing to grade objectively 
 so a <unk> years ago i was in a band 
 one of our <unk> had a roommate who knew how to do websites so made a sort of basic framework for me to complete a site for us 
 i 've forgotten how to do most of that little stuff i could do so bear with me i do n't know all the actual terms 
 mostly i put up pictures and links and uploaded some mp3 's of us playing live 
 the problem started when i think he deleted what i had uploaded to the server 
 so now the website looked like shit it looked like a giant 5 year old attacked it with an eraser 
 when i asked him about it he said suck my dick '' a few times and nothing else 
 mind you his dad paid for everything for him and no one could tell if he had a job 
 he spent most of his time that we could tell trying to fuck women he met in internet chat rooms 
 so i got to work 
 first using whatever software thing he gave me i made another account 
 i did n't know how to change my password which he knew but could make another account entirely 
 then i <unk> a solid black image that said this website is being neglected by douchenozzle 
 his screen name is <unk> on every messenger 
 bother him until he <unk> it '' 
 then i made that the only thing a <unk> would see if they went to the site 
 next i registered his screen name on a couple dozen music message boards and only made the same post on each one -- look at this awesome website i made for my band '' 
 about twelve hours later he 'd changed the site back to the crappy state he 'd left it in and locked out my account ... so i signed in with the new one i made and changed it back 
 it stayed like that for a couple more days before he <unk> the whole thing 
 next time i saw him he freaked out on me 
 what the fuck dude i lost like three customers because of that '' 
 my reply of course was suck my dick 
 there is a tl : dr from a member of my college dorm suite when he shared the most difficult thing about his life 
 moving to a small town right as puberty begins is a hard thing for a boy to go through 
 it 's even worse when you 're a korean in a <unk> white neighborhood 
 hey <unk> face 
 are you gon na eat some more of that disgusting shit today '' 
 the bullying broke me 
 i 've cut myself while listening to adam 's song '' 
 i even though about doing a <unk> with my dad 's <unk> my attendance for the 1st year of school was so poor i had to repeat the year 
 as soon as people found that i would be repeating a year of school another slew of abuse was coming 
 then right there i tried to hang myself in the garage over a towel so that my spilled bowels would not <unk> my parents when they had to clean me 
 but by some chance or some <unk> intervention i identify as <unk> i survived and was subsequently placed in a <unk> ward 
 7 months that 's what it took to fix me 
 to convince me that i was not at fault 
 that i was not <unk> in some way to the other children 
 that i am strong 
 i returned to school 
 for the next four years i <unk> abuse while achieving the highest academic excellence 
 i did find <unk> in the library where the <unk> would introduce me to literature from his own collection 
 finally college applications came in 
 my time to show the <unk> of my efforts has begun 
 i received the acceptance letter to one of america 's top 20 universities 
 word spreads around quickly as usual once i <unk> my acceptance letter 
 the rest of the year goes by smoothly 
 i spend the summer at community college taking two courses that would help me graduate earlier 
 on the first day of summer class i run into an old bully 
 though she had a two year academic advantage on me her advantage is now gone 
 it 's my turn to laugh at her now 
 as she struggles in this calculus course i do my best to achieve better than her 
 i chose to sit behind her so that she can see the results of my <unk> 
 through weekly chapter quizzes and the two midterms before the final i silently remind her that anything she can do i can do much better 
 two weeks prior to the final i 'm approached by my defeated <unk> 
 she starts to cry <unk> how she was sorry for the two years of bullying me 
 she 's bawling how if she fails this calculus course again her parents will stop supporting her 
 <unk> my vengeance shall finally be at hand 
 i pretended to be sympathetic and told her i was past her bullying 
 she becomes hopeful she <unk> against me and <unk> if i can tutor her in calculus 
 *the moment of <unk> i <unk> her to come closer i whisper fuck off '' 
 i did n't bother to check out what happened after the final but facebook is feeding me delicious tears 
 she appears to be <unk> at her friends houses 
 tl : dr be korean 
 move to small city in america 
 get bullied based on <unk> and the <unk> of puberty on the male body 
 almost kill myself 
 go back to high school two years later 
 get accepted to a top 20 university in america 
 go to summer school 
 meet old bitch 
 drink delicious tears as she <unk> in <unk> and he does n't bother to help <unk> i worked in boston i used to take the <unk> rail in 
 there was a small lot that was not an mbta lot which <unk> the pay $ 2 per day '' lot that the mbta ran 
 for 5 years i parked in this small lot with several other regulars including the mbta conductors who all wanted to save $ <unk> $ 600 per year 
 one day i pull in to the lot and discover that there is a padlock on the gate which has been <unk> shut 
 i see dave our regular conductor for the <unk> just clicking the lock home and roll down my window and ask him : hey dave what gives '' 
 new policy only mbta employees can park here now '' the lot was small and when we regulars '' parked there some of the conductors and other <unk> <unk> had to pay 
 i <unk> and dig for change which is composed of <unk> and <unk> left over from fast food purchases quarters were for tolls 
 on the way home i stop at a cvs in boston and pick up my own padlock 
 i get to the lot and instead of rushing with the rest of the cattle to our cars i confidently walk over to the gate of the little free lot and place my lock to which only i have the keys on the chain 
 the conductors do n't get to their cars until after the <unk> and cursory clean up happens i live at the end of the line 
 the next morning i see that the gate is wide open my lock has been bolt cut and is laying on the ground under a no longer used chain 
 i park conductor dave is getting out of his car we exchange the nod '' and i walk with him to the platform 
 other regulars '' are pulling in and getting out of their cars now along with the other mbta folks that are there in time to snag a free spot 
 so what happened to the new policy '' i innocently ask dave 
 too much trouble '' 
 he says 
 besides i think the laundromat actually owns the land and they got pissed and locked us in last night 
 had to go find bolt cutters to get out '' 
 do tell dave do tell 
 for the next 2 years that i worked in boston <unk> a problem 
 total savings 
 ~ $ <unk> 
 screwing the mbta 
 priceless 
 edit : since it seems to be a point of <unk> the lot is an open dirt lot that it turns out actually was owned by the laundromat next door who did n't care who parked there 
 the new policy '' was one that was implemented by the mbta employees <unk> ... and not one which was official 
 this was *not* an employee lot and was as fair game to me and the other people who knew this as well as the mbta folks 
 hope that <unk> things <unk> this goes <unk> back when me and my friends were around 18 or so 
 we were quite a rowdy bunch 
 not explicitly mean but we were generally lacking in the respect department 
 we were visiting a festival and were camping just at the end of the camp area close to a forest 
 now when we get back from a night of partying and wake up the next day we notice that lots of our <unk> has been stolen 
 cell phones knifes <unk> clothes anything that looked remotely valuable 
 they probably did it during night so they got what they could out of our tents in the dark 
 that shit was not going to fly oh no 
 we promptly <unk> our <unk> and went on a <unk> inspector <unk> rampage questioning everyone we thought even remotely suspicious 
 as the camping was huge this went on for most of the day giving us nothing but new <unk> 
 we then <unk> as we were close to the forest that someone from outside had raided our tents 
 we promptly went on to search the forest and found several campers trying their best to get a free festival 
 we checked their tents as best we could without damaging anything 
 after an hour or so of this suddenly in a <unk> tent with the tenants out we spotted my friend’s axe though the fabric of the <unk> tent 
 after that it went <unk> 
 we tore their tent apart arguably with thin evidence but then we found lots of our stolen stuff 
 cell phones clothes yeah this was definitely them 
 we proceeded to trash everything they had with them 
 all the clothes sleeping bags 
 afterwards we threw the remains up in the surrounding trees 
 we found their keys tickets off the island where the festival was held and a cell phone which we of course trashed as such was the general atmosphere 
 when in rome 
 some <unk> medicine was found 
 we decide not to trash that not out of the good of our heart but because we thought it more constructive to leave it whole 
 pissed on 
 well after looking around all their stuff torn to shreds and thrown all over the small <unk> the steam went out of us 
 their former camp looked like <unk> had visited 
 this was all fine and <unk> but we felt something was lacking 
 we wanted some personal time with the people living there 
 they were a guy and a girl judging from the former clothes 
 so we settled down 
 made ourselves comfortable <unk> our sleeping bags 
 we even ordered pizzas 
 and we waited ... now granted we were not very <unk> 
 we questioned everyone moving through the forest to their tents and were generally having a blast 
 this led to our downfall 
 a friend that was happening to watch the path into forest called me : <unk> the hell out cops are coming ” 
 i was alone at the trashed camp at the time 
 i promptly gathered up or stuff and went around the corner of some bushes 
 where i met two police officers riding the biggest horses i have ever seen 
 i just walked straight to and by them the horses just becoming bigger and bigger as the laws of <unk> perspective set in 
 i still don’t really know why they did not stop me i was probably looking guilty as fuck leaving that <unk> camp 
 anyhow we never got that face time with the burglars 
 we decided to give it a rest as the police now was involved and we had happened to do some things they might take offence at 
 but we still and their keys and tickets to the main land 
 we refunded two of our own tickets and used theirs instead as this way it became less traceable 
 while on the 3 hour boat ride back to mainland we went <unk> and threw the keys in the sea 
 it felt good as their tickets had partially funded the gift of keys to the sea god 
 tldr : someone broke into our tents and stole most of value during a festival 
 we found their camp and most of our gear trashed the rest except the <unk> medicine which we pissed <unk> on used their tickets back to main land and threw their keys in the <unk> to part 2 of my story : i must have deleted the original post 
 oh well 
 some of the <unk> warned me that i do n't get too in deep with this little past time of mine 
 but i can not just rationalize the bad guy gal getting away with it and for how easy i am <unk> this <unk> this took about 15 minutes of my day 
 so after she went cold for a few months i assumed all was well the new dude she married found out her con via my anonymous facebook message and she split after he confronted her - off and out of my reach forever fine by me 
 turns out she ended up coming back to him along with a new facebook account new last name even an off the books job working for her husbands side business making arts and <unk> cute 
 i came across this on social media because it seems her whole family is now aware of this relationship and are in full support of their union 
 i would n't mind that except for the fact that her family did n't give two shits about her when she was locked up 
 the burden was on me to comfort her through visits and phone calls and money ... and most of all my time 
 now if the burden never actually was on me and her family was helping her without my knowledge she was thus manipulating me and hid the truth of their involvement 
 i feel more revenge is totally appropriate again 
 on the other hand if her family was n't helping her ever and it actually was just me alone ... well that would kinda <unk> me now that they are suddenly all loving and supportive because she has her life back on track 
 with of course a new husband providing everything to her since she can not provide for herself still a fugitive and still flat broke 
 where were they when i dealt with her <unk> 
 and why are they enjoying the <unk> of her new savior 's labor knowing full and well she is doing the exact same thing she attempted to do to me and her other ex-husband s 
 no they ca n't have their daughter back like none of her exploits or past decisions ever happened and they especially ca n't have her back with me knowing they did nothing to help her ever 
 so i paid $ <unk> to find out her husband 's address online match pictures i found on a real estate website to his pictures on facebook verified it was his 
 emailed the address to u.s. <unk> who contacted her offending state who put me in contact with a parole recovery agent who then contacted local police in her new state who showed up at his apartment and took her to jail 
 last time she got 6 months for violating parole instagram pics drinking and she was escorting on the side this time for straight up fleeing 
 who knows if they will give her more this time considering she bailed after barely a month once they released her for parole the second time 
 you could argue this is <unk> revenge i 've gone too far leave her alone now etc 
 maybe i made up new justifications regarding her family and annoyed her husband did n't heed my warning so i had to do this again 
 then again my second attempt at revenge <unk> so this is my <unk> 
 one thing is for sure she 's still a criminal that has n't once <unk> her end of the bargain in the courts 
 i assume she does n't know someone is actually following her whereabouts considering how dumb she would be to broadcast her location on the internet ... or maybe she 's fully aware of her <unk> she has on her husband and it 's only a matter of time before she goes back to prison 
 she knows he 'll stay by her side because she 's played that game once before ... so here 's my story down up or side vote does n't matter to me i did n't want to leave this story unfinished 
 i 'll probably keep <unk> on her if she returns to fugitive status again 
 if not best of luck to her 
 edit : here 's the origin post part 1 if you care to start from the beginning : this story is a bit out of character for this forum but i think you 'll enjoy it 
 <unk> dolmatovsky was a fairly well known <unk> <unk> and author 
 during ww2 he was a front line war <unk> 
 since this was the <unk> there was no independent press and he was a full red army officer 
 during <unk> he was captured along with 100,000 other soviet soldiers and officers in the <unk> pocket the officers were separated from the regular soldiers and led into a school 
 they were made to sit behind desks 
 alexander <unk> von daniels a german general came in to the room and delivered a long lecture to the captured soviet officers that the soviet union is <unk> on the superiority of the reich and the <unk> of resistance 
 the soviet officers were then sent to concentration camps 
 the fact that dolmatovsky was a <unk> escaped the nazis and he was sent to a military camp 
 he managed to escape and somehow <unk> the russian army 
 several years passed and dolmatovsky found himself at the battle of <unk> 
 during operation <unk> the <unk> <unk> the german 6th army which forced its <unk> 
 much of the 6th army command including <unk> <unk> <unk> surrendered as well 
 dolmatovsky found out that von daniels was among the captured <unk> 
 he asked one of the soviet commanders <unk> to arrange a meeting 
 when the request was granted he put on a little play ... von daniels was marched into a schoolhouse and made to sit behind a desk 
 dolmatovsky walked in and asked von daniels if he recognized him 
 von daniels did n't 
 he then reminded him of the <unk> pocket the schoolhouse there the little classroom packed with soviet officers and the little lecture on the superiority of the reich ... the story starts here : the <unk> of the bitch queen now in addition to all the shit mentioned in the link above there was one thing the bq did to me that i still ca n't quite believe it happened because it was so petty and mean 
 as i said in that post my health was and is fucking awful and the company got some pretty nice bonuses from the government as part of a program to try help people with <unk> get regular work 
 yes my health is *that* bad 
 at one point i managed to catch a cold that very quickly turned into a severe <unk> <unk> 
 i was in the hospital for almost two weeks 
 every day i and/or my family and my government contact called the office to keep them up to date on what was happening and when they could expect me to return to work 
 bq never answered the phones so about half the time my other coworkers took messages and the other half of the time we left messages on the answering machine 
 bq never returned a single call 
 we sent emails 
 still nothing 
 none of us heard a thing from her the entire time i was sick 
 when i returned to work several days before the doctor had recommended i go back she told me she was going to take me to the board to have me fired for missing so much time without telling her 
 naturally i was <unk> but thankfully my other coworkers backed me up and the phone messages and emails were enough to prove my point and i got to keep the job until the end of my contract 
 fast forward two years to this morning 
 i knew bq had lost her job with the company not long after i left but i heard no more about it and gave no shits 
 i 'd gotten my revenge such as it was 
 petty yes but like the pettyrevenge thread said i takes it where i can gets it 
 this morning i got a call from a big local hotel 
 bq put me on her resume as a reference 
 i do n't know how fucking desperate she was to put me on there but when the universe hands me vengeance on a silver platter i fucking take it 
 i told them everything 
 every poor decision every lie every rule broken every attempt to screw the people around her every single little unprofessional and dishonest thing i could think of 
 and then i gave them the number of the company if they wanted more information 
 i know that the industry here is utterly <unk> and this information will be at every decent hotel and motel in the city within the day and probably all over the state within a week 
 she called me a couple hours later demanding to know why i gave her a bad reference 
 do n't use someone you tried to fuck over as a reference bitch 
 okay so this was a few years ago when i was in college 
 i studied languages and it was required of me to spend an entire school year abroad either studying or working to get a feel for the language 
 i decided to pick somewhere rural where nobody would speak english wanting to <unk> myself fully and ended up being a <unk> in a tiny european village 
 i lived in a little apartment next to the <unk> and was supposed to live like part of the family - <unk> on <unk> to 
 do n't get me wrong the place was beautiful the work was <unk> and a great <unk> and my boss was a decent guy 
 it would have been pretty fun were it not for my boss 's wife 
 hoo boy ... where do we even begin with this ball of <unk> 
 bit of background : my boss 's wife -- let 's call her witch -- was a city girl one of those <unk> <unk> who got to travel and work with foreign branches manage major projects etc 
 she was all high heels and designer bags and fancy <unk> with her coworkers ... and then she married a farmer and moved to the <unk> of her country to be a housewife 
 by the time i came to work on the farm witch had two small children and had turned into the <unk> most unpleasant woman i had ever met 
 i learned later that she treated a lot of employees especially women the way she treated me but they were able to leave 
 i was n't 
 witch treated me like dirt 
 i was pretty much treated like a <unk> made to clean her house and look after her children on top of long work days on the farm she hated farm work and did nothing at all to help - this 'll be important later 
 she 'd scream and swear at me and call me every name she could think of whenever her husband was n't around to hear her and sneer in silence when he was 
 i was terrified of her and there was n't much i could do to fight back 
 not only did she control my room and board but also my pay food supplies and the chance of a good review at the end of the school year 
 i needed good references from my employer for my uni to accept me on the final year course and that witch knew it 
 every time i 'd try to talk to her husband or another farm hand she 'd blame it on <unk> differences and then step up her game when they were n't around 
 i remember one week where her husband was away when i got sick with food poisoning and for the entire week she left me in my apartment alone to the point where i ran out of food 
 honestly you 'd expect her to drag out the magic mirror and ask it who 's the <unk> of them all with the way she behaved 
 so this hell goes on for a full nine months and there 's next to nothing i can do about it 
 i just figured i 'd tough it out and go home then i 'd never need to see her again ... but then witch 's husband went away again and i got my chance for revenge 
 it was literally my final day on the farm the afternoon before i flew back home 
 i had to pack and clean up my apartment but she 'd ordered me away from all that to fix a window in one of our guest houses - she liked setting petty chores to <unk> me then scream at me when it was impossible to finish them all 
 so i 'm hanging out the window two floors up when witch comes stomping down the path in her high heels and some fancy jacket and starts yelling up at me in her language 
 she says that i 'm to go to the goat shed right away because one of the goats is giving birth and her husband is n't there to help 
 now we 'd lost two of the goats that winter so it was important that someone did it 
 we could n't afford to lose another goat - or rather <unk> could n't afford to 
 and that 's where the revenge came in : before he 'd left my boss had given me my final pay and written and signed a <unk> for my college course 
 i could answer any way i wanted and she could n't do a damn thing 
 no leverage left to hold over me 
 so i smiled all nice and polite and yelled back down that i could n't possibly come and help 
 i still had so much to do and she 'd *told* me that this window needed fixing 
 what if i left it unfinished and someone got hurt 
 what if i could n't clean my apartment in time 
 after all she 'd *told* me to make it spotless for her before i left 
 i 'm so sorry witch but it 's just not possible '' 
 i could already see her starting to panic and she started trying to argue about other people who could take my place doing these jobs 
 her <unk> sixty years old with a back problem her own mother untrained taking care of her kids for her even the cleaning lady that came in once a week lol what 
 i had legit reasons for all of them until finally i said : but ca n't you do it witch 
 you 've been living here for years i bet you 've done this loads of times 
 you 'll get it done no problem '' 
 <unk> 
 she could n't back down from that and the alternative was not doing it and <unk> another dead goat and a pissed off husband 
 she did n't have any leverage left over me and it 's not like she could drag me out of a second floor window so off she went the designated goat <unk> 
 it was twins 
 she was there for three hours 
 the last image i have of witch before i left for good is of her standing in the goat pen surrounded by the neighbour 's kids and a couple of tourists 
 she was still in her high heels and nice clothes holding this slimy <unk> baby goat out as far out in front of her as she could get it covered in blood and placental fluid and this thick yellow <unk> 
 the look of disgust and horror on her face still gives me the warm fuzzies 
 karma 's a bitch lady 
 tldr : boss 's wife makes my life a misery while working abroad 
 <unk> my way into getting little miss <unk> covered in blood and placental fluid 
 my father was a commercial <unk> before i was born 
 he traveled the world originally from canada and worked away for months at a time 
 as an aside one time while fishing a soviet sub <unk> behind them and it was one of the most <unk> experiences of a lifetime for a fearless man 
 anyway the boat and its crew were fishing off the coast of africa and every time they went out to their spot and were about to drop the <unk> ... the engine would <unk> out ... <unk> the second time they hid a crew member in the engine room and found out the second in command was <unk> the engine 
 from what i remember the time for fishing was short and there was a pretty heavy level of competition and a lot at stake 
 the saboteur was being paid by a rival fishing vessel so they could get the advantage so this may not sound like it ... but it was a pretty big deal 
 these people had a short amount of time to make a lot of money and the whole crew was away from their families for long <unk> 
 so what to do with this <unk> 
 their was talk of throwing him overboard but no one wanted to be brought up on charges of murder 
 beating him was not really a punishment 
 so they came up with this ... ... they took his id took all his money stripped him naked and left him on a beach in africa 
 update so some people are asking for a follow up 
 this is my first post so please be kind 
 i am still learning 
 well my dad is passed away now so i only have the details that he told me a long time ago 
 the aftermath is up in the air 
 i am pretty sure the saboteur was from canada or the us 
 i do n't know how he could have made it back without any id or anything 
 that being said the world has a way of looking after you so some people probably gave him some clothes and then he probably could have made it to a <unk> and maybe got a bunch of people to verify who he was via phone ... <unk> i am just <unk> 
 my dad said no one from the fishing crew ever heard from him again ... <unk> i doubt they would be in touch anyway ... so that does n't really mean anything 
 as for the soviet sub 
 the time frame for all of this was probably late 60 's early 70 's 
 the sub just came up fairly close right behind them ... .then observed the ship for about 5 minutes ... .then <unk> again 
 to some it may not sound that scary but my father said it was unreal and he was genuinely freaked out 
 they had no idea the subs intentions 
 they were scared for about 20 minutes after when they guessed that if something was going to happen ... it would have happened 
 off topic but he did work for a <unk> supplier at one point and they <unk> for the fish that they used for <unk> o fish and he said never never never eat a <unk> o fish 
 : that is all i know 
 per request from here 
 this happened to my best friend 
 his wife was japanese and living in america with him on a <unk> visa 
 long story short she was banging some guy who was always an asshole to us 
 we know why now she made the mistake of telling her best friend who lives in japan whom is also my good friend 
 i live in japan the friend was recently cheated on and still very upset 
 she told me 
 my best friend was in the middle of finals 
 went back to school after getting laid off to get a more specialized degree i sat on this information for two weeks and then told him 
 he took it pretty well as it filled in a lot of holes for him 
 then i said so many guys when hurt are too nice 
 i convinced him to ruin this bitch 
 we figured out her facebook password 
 why do most women pick the most obvious of passwords 
 sure enough there were picture conversations and what 's this 
 the boyfriend 's parents 
 glorious 
 it turns out they are super christian 
 my friend contacted the boyfriend 's mother and very politely explained who he was and what went on 
 she was very sorry and she promised my friend that his wife would no longer be welcome in their home 
 step 1 complete 
 step 2 was going to take more skill 
 my friends wife was pretty butt hurt about him ruining her relationship 
 she said she will just tell her parents that my friend beat her 
 they do n't speak english so there was nothing my friend could do 
 i told my friend to write the letter which he did and again explained it very politely 
 per my advice my friend also included the dated photos of them together 
 my mutual japanese friend <unk> the letter into natural japanese 
 my friend 's wife had no idea of his plan 
 she was also planning to go home for a month to visit 
 my friend timed the <unk> of the letter so it arrived one day before she left 
 she received a phone call from her father and he totally sided with my friend 
 his wife called up crying and called him an asshole 
 now if you think this burn could n't get any better you are wrong 
 his wife was looking for her dream job at an industrial design company 
 she had an interview lined up for when she got back 
 they were ready to hire her but when talk about her visa status came up she explained that she will be getting divorced and will lose her status 
 the company explained that they could n't hire her because they do n't have it in the budget to sponsor a visa 
 bam 
 mission complete 
 : she 's now back in japan 
 i guess she works at a japanese company now but that is n't her dream 
 tl dr sometimes cheating bitches get what they deserve 
 i typed this on my phone so sorry if there are typos 
 edit : there seems to be a lot of <unk> cheaters still replying to this post 
 lol i do n't know what jebbie 's real name was but that was his nickname 
 i 'd known the kid since kindergarten and never was there a sweeter person 
 he was a kitten just a cool guy 
 he 'd give you his lunch if you did n't have any 
 he 'd hug you if you 'd had a rough day even if you were a guy 
 jebbie was a <unk> genius 
 top of all of his classes but kinda slow socially 
 he liked people but the kindness made people treat him worse and worse the older he got 
 we were in various schools together up through high school which is where i lost track of him 
 i was a crap student 
 smart but did n't care about the work 
 we 'd gone into one of the most crime ridden shitty school systems north carolina had to offer and i 'd been suspended a half dozen times for various things 
 nothing violent or destructive 
 mostly just <unk> or skipping classes 
 i did n't care about school 
 i was past that 
 life sucked too hard to care 
 jebbie sadly was target of every bully in that school 
 it got really bad sophomore year when we were in algebra 
 this algebra class was taught by a teacher who might once have had a soul but it 'd been sucked out by years of high school 
 she cared less than i did 
 this little fuck we 'll call him hunter who was maybe 140 lbs soaking wet took to abusing jebbie 
 hunter was latino which was more of a <unk> in our school less of a racial divide and a loud mouth little thug 
 mean bastard 
 just cruel 
 he 'd poke jebbie toss things at him kick him after class call him a faggot constantly steal his books and food 
 shit like that 
 jebbie took it all and he 'd try to go to the teachers but the teachers did n't give a shit 
 like i said bad school 
 it came to a head when hunter tripped jebbie and made him split his head on a desk 
 hunter got a week suspension claiming it was an accident 
 jebbie got six <unk> and transferred to another class 
 when he got back his favorite target was gone 
 hunter decided i was going to be the new one 
 i by then had little to lose 
 i was failing every class except theater and english 
 i was considered a <unk> maker by every school admin and was on a first name basis with the school <unk> officer 
 first day he 's back hunter looks around spots me reading quietly in the corner and tosses <unk> at me 
 childish shit but i 'd seen just how much good going to the teachers did jebbie 
 i immediately got up from my desk circled the outside of the room and squared up on hunter 
 he got up but i <unk> him by a good <unk> pounds 
 i knew how it was going to play out though 
 i went for his head getting him in a half <unk> 
 i held it for about five seconds then stepped back 
 he threw a few shitty <unk> <unk> me on the chin and <unk> 
 it was like being punched by a fly in <unk> 
 the teacher was shouting but i let him deck me five or six times then shoved him away 
 he fell over several desks and i retreated to the door stepping outside 
 ten minutes later the school resource cop shows up and i tell him hunter attacked me 
 i say i was just going to <unk> my pencil and he stepped up and pushed me 
 nobody and i mean nobody ... asked the other students what happened and the teacher had n't seen the start of it 
 hunter of course denied it but in doing so he pushed the school resource cop who was telling him to sit back down 
 now hunter is in handcuffs 
 they search him 
 he had three joints a pocket knife and a pack of cigarettes 
 hunter was expelled immediately and charged with assault on a police officer possession on school property and carrying a concealed weapon class 1 <unk> in carolina 
 since it was his third hit for drugs that went up to a felony 
 i got two days suspension to add to my long long list but frankly 
 fucking worth it 
 jebbie wherever you are i wish you all the best 
 you deserved better 
 <unk> alright i said i 'd hunt around and try to find jebbie 
 my mom as it turned out had my old <unk> from highschool for my freshman year and i remembered he was really into theater 
 i found his name and picture in the credits for the school play that year 
 a bit of <unk> later and i found out he got married the announcement was still on the web and moved to california 
 he owns a little computer repair place and has a kid 
 he designs those robotic battle <unk> things 
 fucking coolest stuff i 've ever seen 
 i do n't know if i have the guts to call him 
 no way he 'd remember me 
 i 'm just glad he 's alright 
 this is not mine 
 i just read it and thought you would all love it 
 * take this entire story here with a bit of a raised <unk> since it was told to me by a bunch of drunk old men telling me <unk> stories that have probably been <unk> to hell and back but i can not deny that the stories are entertaining as hell when you have a belly full of <unk> <unk> liquor and goat cooked in <unk> milk and chili <unk> 
 * okay so i just got back from visiting family out in the <unk> the flat kind over the long holiday weekend 
 i <unk> go and visit family since we are so dysfunctional it 's not even funny but this time decided i needed to get out of manila for a couple of days 
 while i was there some <unk> and i got to sitting around with some beer <unk> up stories about my mother 's father that i had never heard of 
 my grandfather was the younger son and the second child in a family with five siblings 
 his *kuya* older brother was already a lawyer when the second world war broke out and the japanese invaded the philippines 
 grandpa was a young 15 at the time farmer who helped his dad pay for basic necessities while his brother paid for the education of his three younger sisters 
 the family was n't poor but they were n't sipping champagne either 
 think lower <unk> '' 
 on christmas day <unk> grandpa 's older brother shows up at the family house with a bag and a <unk> trunk 
 the bag is filled with paper money and silver coins and the trunk 's got some guns in it 
 he had <unk> all his assets and purchased the guns where he could find them getting out of manila while he still could realizing the japanese were going to occupy the city 
 life went on relatively unchanged for the next couple of months but the news was always <unk> 
 the japanese occupied manila then swept through the flat <unk> of central <unk> including my grandpa 's town 
 the american forces caught in a pincer movement eventually retreated to bataan and <unk> and anyone even vaguely familiar with the pacific war during ww2 knows how that ended 
 side note : my uncles said that according to my grandpa and other <unk> the occupying japanese <unk> were <unk> polite and very very <unk> when <unk> with <unk> 
 the lower ranking soldiers however were a complete <unk> 
 my uncles insist that they were korean probably <unk> and that any <unk> ie random beatings rape etc 
 that would happen would be at their hands 
 i 'm guessing that the officers would <unk> their men and their actions after the fact because to do otherwise would make them seem weak 
 anyway my grandpa and his brother begin resisting the japanese 
 it was mostly information passed from one village or town to another but during the bataan death march they also sheltered at least one american soldier who fled east after <unk> to put some distance between themselves and the japanese 
 i took this with a grain of salt every single family within a hundred miles that survived ww2 has at least one story of <unk> a death march soldier 
 it came to a head in late <unk> when another resistance group from a nearby village stole a truck with a load of gasoline or ammunition my uncles could n't agree 
 the japanese went house to house looking for the <unk> and they caught my grandpa 's brother in a well trying to hide some weapons 
 after they pulled him up and they found the guns my <unk> was <unk> executed by <unk> 
 my grandpa was very close to his *kuya* 
 after a period of grief he went full on <unk> on the japanese including : * <unk> with his neighbors to make <unk> wine and selling it cheap to the occupying <unk> it was n't large maybe <unk> men total <unk> on their already poor discipline and <unk> them to drunkards 
 they got so bad they were replaced by another unit 
 grandpa introduced the new boys to the joys of drink too 
 rinse and repeat 
 japanese officers yelling at their troops became a common sight 
 * <unk> rats and field mice and <unk> them into the <unk> in the surrounding areas that the japanese commandeered to store their stolen rice 
 aside from eating the stored rice the rats shit everywhere 
 this pissed off the japanese to no end <unk> knows never to fuck with an asian 's rice 
 * collecting shit from pretty much every single human who was willing to <unk> in a bucket for him mixing it with water to thin it down then <unk> '' the trees around the japanese hq and barracks 
 it would dry out fairly quickly in the heat so there was only a vague <unk> but when it rained 
 it turned into a <unk> sludge that clung to everything especially the <unk> troops and their vehicles 
 apparently a couple of those trees are still around and they are huge and bear delicious delicious <unk> every year 
 * putting any and all handy chemicals into every single liquid the japanese were storing 
 water oil gasoline 
 you name it 
 when he could get away with it he poured in everything from salt to soap to <unk> aka rancid piss 
 * stealing japanese supplies be it arms ammunition medication or whatever <unk> it then turning right around and <unk> on himself : he would tell the japanese officers that he had heard '' of a <unk> '' buried by a resistance group '' then go on and point out the cache he had buried a week or month or two earlier 
 he fucked with those too : when possible some but not all of the supplies were tampered with to look perfectly normal yet malfunction when used 
 the japanese officers thought he was loyal to the <unk> and he got preferential treatment allowing him and his neighbors to cook up even more shenanigans 
 * when the americans finally invaded my grandpa at the ripe old age of 18 and the resistance group he was with went on the offensive scouting out the path ahead of the americans and killing isolated japanese when they could 
 according to my uncles my <unk> never talked about this except to say that it was how he met his wife 
 after the war grandpa did what he knew best : he kept farming 
 he was however smart enough to buy a couple of neighboring farms whose families had been killed by the japanese 
 with nearly four times the <unk> land area from before the war he was able to continue his brother 's work and put his sisters through school 
 and that i think was the cherry on top of his revenge <unk> 
 my grandpa died fairly young 50s and after hearing these stories i regret that i did n't get to know my grandpa when i myself was a man 
 preferably over <unk> my story 
 my mom is a pharmacist and she constantly deals with <unk> trying to get their fix 
 this is a big busy pharmacy in <unk> doing hundreds of prescriptions every day so you get all sorts 
 the pharmacist is bound by a ton of laws and procedures 
 this latest story started a week ago and just wrapped up last night 
 a lady came in with a <unk> for oxycodone 
 that 's a pretty heavy drug that 's on the controlled list and is pretty badly abused 
 the corporate policy is that if the pharmacist has any suspicion that they inform the customer that the drug is out of stock and they will order it and it will come in a couple of days 
 that 's exactly what happened and the woman flipped the fuck out 
 she screamed at my mom threw shit in the pharmacy and was escorted out by security 
 after she called corporate to complain how horrible my mom was and tried to get her fired 
 after this treatment my mom was pretty pissed off 
 there 's a database that <unk> can access to look up certain controlled drugs that are prescribed to a particular customer 
 this database showed that this woman was getting the same prescription for oxycodone from multiple doctors and trying to fill different prescriptions in different pharmacies 
 because this lady did n't behave my mom went above and beyond and contacted all the <unk> doctors to let them know that this lady was <unk> 
 they all flipped out because what she did was very illegal and all dropped her as a patient 
 all the other pharmacies that were filling her prescriptions blocked her as well 
 if my mom was in a really bad mood she could 've contacted <unk> but she decided not to 
 however we 're pretty certain that the doctors are obligated to do so 
 if you 're breaking the law do n't be an asshole to people who can catch you 
 this happened nearly ten years ago when i was a stupid college student 
 i went to school in a state which has very liberal policies regarding <unk> <unk> the chief requirements are that you are a resident of the state and that you pay a small fee to a doctor in order to obtain your medical card for whatever <unk> you like 
 my two best friends who were also my dorm roommates and i <unk> ourselves this opportunity since it would allow us to have a fair amount of pot without legal penalty university policy was n't as open minded but we did n't care 
 since we were able to have a rather large quantity we occasionally helped the other residents in our dorm acquire what they wanted so they could avoid some of the <unk> characters attracted to this particular business 
 one of the residents was dipshit ds and he often came by our room with his <unk> buddy lil twitchy lt 
 everyone who came by was treated as a friend and trusted to respect the community spirit of the residence hall 
 one day after classes a friend and i returned to my room to partake and i discovered that the glass storage jar was n't in it 's usual place 
 thinking one of my roommates had maybe borrowed it i called them both 
 neither had and at this point we began to worry 
 i 'm going to take this opportunity to introduce my roommates so bear with me 
 first we have the grizzly a <unk> lbs <unk> '' <unk> native : bearded <unk> with a liberal application of <unk> <unk> 
 next we have thunder lord : <unk> lbs of pure angry muscle with a <unk> interest in <unk> <unk> and tattoos 
 finally there 's me 
 i 'm no <unk> <unk> <unk> god but i 'm fairly smart and i can hold my own in a tight spot 
 as i sit in my room waiting for my friends to return i 'm <unk> with my phone trying to think of someone anyone who might have a <unk> explanation for where our weed has gone 
 then i notice a missed call from an unknown number placed the previous night around 3 a.m. when thunder and grizzly return i call this number and ds answers 
 i ask him why he called and he says oh lt and i were hanging out last night and we wanted a little smoke i was calling to see if you guys were still awake 
 when you did n't pick up i got some from tommy 
 i hope i did n't wake you '' 
 i reassure him that he did n't and get off the phone 
 i relay the conversation to my now furious mates and we agree that something seems fishy 
 we ca n't reach tommy so we walk down the hall and visit ds 's long suffering roommate who informs us that ds and lt were making liberal use of the <unk> marching powder last night and were awake until all hours 
 we decide to pay a visit to lt who is as his name suggests a twitchy little bastard 
 as we walk up the lawn of his dorm who should we see but dipshit himself head down trying very hard not to be noticed 
 we approach and surround the poor bastard and it is immediately obvious he is very stoned 
 ds we seem to be missing some of our stash and we 've heard you were wide awake last night 
 any chance you might know where our jar walked off to '' 
 i ask 
 he <unk> no man no way 
 i told you tommy hooked me up last night '' 
 alright ds that 's fine that 's fine 
 but given the situation we would like to verify that 
 can we see your phone just to make sure tommy 's number is in your call log around 3 am '' 
 at this point ds is sweating bullets but he says sorry i left my phone in <unk> room and i really got ta get to class '' 
 on a hunch i slip away from him while thunder and grizzly continue to grill him and pull my phone out 
 i redial the unknown number and seconds later ds 's pants begin to play music 
 ds if you 've left your phone behind what 's ringing in your pocket 
 why are you lying to us 
 why do n't you just come clean now and save us all a bunch of trouble '' 
 and thus the <unk> open 
 the tears and confession pour forth and ds tells that what remains of our stash is up in lt 's dorm room 
 we escort him there and he knocks on the door 
 when lt opens the door a wave of smoke <unk> out and he has a huge stoned smile as he greets ds 
 when he sees us <unk> his buddy that smile <unk> like a <unk> in hell 
 we shove ds into the room and grizz locks the door behind us 
 a beating of <unk> proportions is about to commence and that 's bad 
 bad for the thieves and bad for us 
 thinking fast i say alright you stupid fucks here 's the deal 
 you broke into our room and stole from us while we slept 
 ballsy but stupid 
 so i 'm going to weigh what remains of my stash and you two morons are going to pay for what you smoked 
 three times over once for grizz once for thunder and once for me 
 it 's going to be a lot money so you have a month to get it all together 
 in the meanwhile we are going to take this laptop this <unk> and that xbox as collateral 
 you 'll get it all back when you pay up 
 you do n't pay you do n't get it back 
 good '' 
 the idiots look relieved and thunder and grizzly seem pleased so we collect the collateral and what remains of our stash and return <unk> home 
 the next day i awaken around 1pm with a <unk> but victorious hangover because someone very very shrill is screaming at the top her lungs just outside the dorm building 
 i walk downstairs to investigate and to my amazement a middle aged woman is <unk> berating ds just outside the dorm 
 i <unk> with no small glee and hear you stupid stupid little shit 
 your father and i have given you everything everything and this how you <unk> us 
 $ 12,000 in credit card bills and bank over draft fees 
 what the actual fuck have you been doing here 
 you 've been at college 2 months and you have n't gone to class once 
 this is finished right here right now 
 i drove here alone but you 're getting in the car with me and we are leaving '' 
 apparently ds had burnt though his folks money and landed himself on academic suspension 
 it seems his folks got the bills and a call from the <unk> office on same day and his mom decided her little boy still had some growing up to do 
 she was true to her word threw him in the car and that was the last we ever saw of ds 
 all his belongings were left behind so we split the goods with his roommate and made out like <unk> 
 lt lasted a month or so more before apparently deciding that a liberal arts education was n't for him and dropping out 
 before leaving he paid us in full and we returned his things 
 tl dr step 1 : track down stolen pot 
 step 2 : <unk> moronic thieves and restrain <unk> roommates 
 step 3 : moronic thieves dig their own <unk> <unk> 
 step 4 : profit <unk> discovered this subreddit today i thought i 'd share my story 
 from kindergarten to 5th grade i went to an all girls catholic school 
 i never met any boys before who were n't blood related so when i transferred to regular public school in 6th grade i was culture shocked 
 all the boys were so ... <unk> 
 they were flipping girls skirts and making rude comments 
 i was the new girl & amp the new target of the alpha bully let 's call him tommy 
 in 6th grade i was a small girl & amp tommy was around 9 inches taller than me and he was big like fat kid <unk> some muscle big 
 i could n't stand his perverted comments 
 he said things like i should come suck his dick and things like that 
 the other girls said you get used to it '' but i just could n't believe my little catholic ears 
 we had this group project where he and i were grouped together i was assigned to bring materials and he said do n't forget to bring lube and <unk> '' 
 and everyone in class laughed i felt so embarrassed 
 i know this does n't sound like a big deal but to 12 year old me it was i could n't take it anymore 
 i do n't know what came over me i took apart one of my <unk> notebooks walked up to tommy & amp his friends and slashed tommy 's face with the wire from my notebook 
 he fell to the ground he was on his knees & amp hands 
 i elbow his spine i think this is a wrestling move i do n't know the name he 's on his stomach with a bloody face 
 i was about to kick him in the face but he was crying already so i came to my senses and walked away 
 the slash left a scar on his forehead & amp he never made an obscene comment towards any of the girls again 
 edit : i 'm 21 now & amp i saw him on the train once scar still there 
 we <unk> at each other & amp i guess all is forgiven edit 2 : i do n't understand why when a man posts a prorevenge about ass kicking he gets a you 're awesome bro '' 
 but when a little girl does it it 's like you 're a terrible person '' ... this bully was sexually harassing all the girls in my grade 
 do you guys have any idea what it 's like to be a young girl & amp being told you 're gon na get fucked in the ass later tonight 
 no you do n't well maybe some do i guess i just flipped out because i was sexually touched by my tennis coach in 2nd <unk> but that 's another story 
 sorry for pissing everyone off with my post edit 3 : after remembering this story i looked up tommy on facebook & amp he 's a teacher now 
 <unk> 
 lol 
 edit 4 : i did n't mention it before since i did n't think this post would get a lot of attention but i should mention it now to justify my actions 
 he was n't just sexually harassing me & amp girls with his words but he liked groping us too 
 slapping our butts grabbing our <unk> <unk> into the girls restroom etc 
 there was even one instance he jerked off in the girls bathroom and it <unk> other boys to do these things as well 
 all the girls did n't want to stand up to him so i felt like i had to do it to get him to stop 
 so yeah if i went to juvenile hall back then i would n't even plead not guilty or deny it 
 but he deserves juvi time too 
 edit 5 : oh my god my first reddit gold 
 : 'd thank you so much 
 i 'll treasure this moment forever 
 as a naturally thin woman i have had my share of being called everything under the sun from string <unk> to <unk> string 
 most of it does n't phase me but every once in awhile if you catch me in the wrong mood i might go off on someone for <unk> my <unk> 
 this particular day i had walked into a local watering hole with a swimming pool on premise and i wore what i considered to be proper <unk> for this venue 
 shorts and a <unk> with a bathing suit underneath 
 just so we are clear on the subject most women on any given day requiring the use of a bathing suit are already battling body conscious demons without the aid of perfect <unk> <unk> <unk> unsolicited advice 
 as it happens sometimes the day 's events are going to have their own agenda 
 i just wanted to meet some friends and blow off steam that day 
 as i walked by a man whose body type <unk> a <unk> whale i can hear him snickering with his cronies pointing at me and <unk> things like that chick needs to eat a cheeseburger '' 
 i started to stop dead in my tracks and do an about face but i <unk> my inner <unk> christmas from dumb & amp <unk> and instead calmly proceeded to the bartender 
 i smiled and gave her my order 
 a drink a shot and a cheeseburger later i 'm feeling pretty satisfied <unk> and <unk> 
 i then turned over to the sea cow that had been calling me names and i gave him a polite wave 
 a bucket of beers later i 'm pretty sure he is now second guessing that perhaps we have met somewhere and surely thinks i am flirting 
 i smile sweetly at the bartender and i hand her a generous tip for what would have been my entire check when that <unk> gentleman right over there offered to pick up my tab '' and i smile and wave again just as le douche is motioning for me to come over and the bartender catches a glimpse of a hand gesture and assumes he is <unk> his offer '' to take care of the check 
 she smiles takes my tip wishes me a nice day and i 'm off 
 but not without first ordering a side salad to be sent to my new friend the sea cow along with a hand written note in a folded up <unk> that states i too know how to suggest food that seems consistent with body mass 
 after reading for hours of peoples brilliant revenge i felt <unk> to share my <unk> moment of glory 
 to set the stage here 's a little background 
 back in high school i was more of a nerd than not but i also had a <unk> group of friends so i had an in with most of the <unk> and those that i did n't necessarily agree with were usually far enough removed that i never had any problems with them directly 
 however the few that i silently resented were public enemies of a sort 
 anyway there was this one kid a year my senior let 's call him cockus the ball master or cm for short 
 for the better part of my first three years i see cm around and am generally left with a sour taste 
 it 's the usual bullshit calling people out for whatever reason then taking it out on professors who try to intervene 
 there were a few <unk> with the law in cm 's short and <unk> career as professional douchebag too but again nothing that directly involved me 
 that is until spring semester of the 11th grade 
 one day when we were packing up from an orchestra <unk> both <unk> we happened to be in the same band this semester 
 it was a split campus school and he went to the other one but a few classes were only taught at one and students were <unk> between them good ole ball master accidentally left his ipod on a chair which we later learned 
 well come monday morning he 's on a <unk> 
 cm accuses one of my good friends of stealing it who i knew well enough to put my own reputation for his character and then i was also accused of theft 
 a fly on the wall no more i say 
 fuck this kid and his shit i 'm not going down for lies 
 a half-assed investigation gets opened by the school but about two days later someone thinks to check with the <unk> staff and sure enough one of the janitors picked it up over the weekend and put it in the lost and found 
 after that incident cm kept a little distance from me and my friend but there was a <unk> sense of animosity towards us as though we had accused him of the theft not the other way around 
 by the end of the year i had n't had an opportunity to take revenge on cockus for what he did to us and to dozens of others which included destruction of personal property vandalism and a lot of the petty shit 
 it seemed that my chances were slipping away but then a good old <unk> ex <unk> came our way and he got held back another year 
 jackpot 
 karma came around and gave him a swift kick up the arse but it was also right into our laps 
 **the revenge** : flash forward to spring semester of our senior year 
 i 'm taking a biology class and it 's another one of the shared ones 
 guess who 's there 
 our mate cockus the ball master 
 although he does n't acknowledge our prior standing i sure as hell do 
 forgive and forget i try and live by but sometimes life just does n't want that to happen so fuck him 
 to quickly set the stage this biology room like most of the building was <unk> back in the 40s and had n't seen many renovations since the 70s when a few <unk> were built 
 all the lab tables were that <unk> black <unk> rock stuff each shaped like a <unk> where one side joined it to the wall 
 each of those sides held a row of 4 drawers individually <unk> as well as two more <unk> of drawers on the walls between the island pods 
 there were somewhere around 8-10 of them in the room making for a <unk> <unk> of drawers around <unk> of them in total 
 for the most part we used the front of the classroom but occasionally we went to the back to <unk> cats and shit 
 one lab i opened one of the drawers out of curiosity but it was empty 
 turns out they all were and had n't been used for quite some time 
 what a waste ... ... what an opportunity a few days later i stumbled across an old ass box filled with <unk> brass keys 
 i just had to know 
 each one was paired with an identical key on an old <unk> ring and each one went to one of the two hundred odd drawers 
 and that 's where the plot was hatched 
 over the course of about two months with the help of another one of my quietly unsuspecting yet <unk> devious friends we began <unk> out where all the keys went 
 our professor was one of the best i ever had and being a class at the end of the day usually we would have some time where he would answer questions and help people with whatever and the rest of us could do whatever work we needed to get done 
 that meant a few minutes every day where we could slip away to the lab tables and look like we were doing homework unsupervised 
 when we finally had all the keys paired to their locks we took half a dozen or so each day and <unk> locked them in different drawers 
 so if you had one key you would have to find the drawer it opened and there would be another key inside which opened a different drawer which had another key ... you get the idea 
 but because there were two keys we could keep the key for the last drawer on hand and open it whenever we wanted to but the other was locked away in one of the drawers 
 and also since there were two we <unk> them and ever fifty drawers or so we put a mountain of the previously used keys in it 
 sort of like a <unk> fuck you 
 two weeks after we started we locked the last key away leaving us with the one for the final drawer and one for the first drawer 
 for good measure we made the final drawer on the top so you could n't somehow jimmy the ones above it open and reach your hand down 
 by now it was drawing near the end of the semester and so we waited for our opportunity to give cm the petty shitstorm of a lifetime 
 and our chance came at the best possible time 
 two days before the end of the term cockus left the room for something and also left that fucking ipod on his desk 
 when the opportunity arose i casually lifted it and some other douchey personal effects 
 into the last drawer they went 
 i had been ready for this moment for months and looking at the <unk> horrifically devious sabotage made me so happy i could sing no one wants that 
 of course cm does n't notice that the ipod is gone again and leaves for the day 
 come the last day of classes i drop an envelope on his desk when everyone is packing their final things for the year 
 inside was the first key and a note <unk> the words <unk> to play a game 
 this was the height of when saw was becoming popular and come cryptic shit about what he had to do to get his things back 
 if i could have taken a photograph of his face when he realized what happened i would need nothing more out of life 
 of course i did n't stick around to see if he ever made it to the last drawer but no one would help poor cockus the ball master 
 my only regret is that i could not have done it sooner 
 fuck that guy 
 **tl dr** a jackass at my old senior high accused me of theft so i stole his shit and locked it in a room with two hundred keys 
 edit : changed the name of ole cockus the ball master because i 'm not here to <unk> people just tell a <unk> dad is an extremely organized guy 
 he has to have everything in order at all times however every once in a while he forgets stupid shit 
 in the late 90 's my dad owned a beautiful black truck he spent a lot of time and money making it look great 
 one day my mom and dad go out to dinner but decide to take my mothers white jeep instead of my fathers truck 
 originally they were going to take the truck but figured it would be fun to take the jeep out with the top down 
 this is where my dad messes up 
 he already had the trucks keys in his hand and while helping my mother take the top down he left them resting on the back bumper 
 he immediately forgot he put them there and they drive off without a second thought 
 so now my dads car keys are in the middle of the street in front of our house 
 a man is walking around the neighborhood and spots them on the ground he then starts to click the unlock button to see if the car is anywhere near him 
 my dads truck lights flash and the man decides to take a joy ride 
 the asshole speeds into a field and proceeds to drive as fast as he can throwing all of my dads cds and personal belongings out the window including my dads wallet 
 this guy absolutely <unk> the car tons of huge dents scratches and the bottom of it is covered in mud sticks and grass 
 at this point my mom and dad arrive home and freak out because they are short one car in the driveway 
 my dad immediately remembers the keys he left on the bumper and gets pissed at himself 
 he <unk> if the guy who took his car would be dumb enough to ride it around their neighborhood so he takes the jeep and starts looking 
 sure as shit my dad finds the dumbass 10 minutes later cruising down a street by they 're house 
 my dad passes in front of him and slows down to a stop gets out of the jeep walks up to the guy who now has the window rolled down wondering what 's going on and punches him square in the face 
 my dad is not a very violent man but seeing the condition his car was in mad him see red 
 my dad then holds the guy back with his arm and calls the police telling them he caught the guy who stole his car 
 the man is arrested and pays for damages to the car and all of the shit he threw out of the window 
 dad says the truck never quite ran the same but it was still great to catch the <unk> in his car 
 please excuse my spelling and grammar errors this was done on my <unk> starts out when i was 8. i was 8 years old and moved from the great outdoors of canada down south to the hot weather of texas 
 my dad was a manager of an oil <unk> and he got a better position as a whole sector manager 
 i was 8 and i was about in second or third grade give or take 
 i was n't informed of me moving until one day my mom went to school with me and checked me out 
 i had a couple good friends and a lot of family in canada that i had to leave 
 after going on the plane the first time ever i was so <unk> my mother said i passed out 
 so when we came to texas we had a big house 
 in canada we had a apartment in the city in texas we had a nice grand big house with a front yard 6 bed rooms 
 i was so happy that i almost forgot i had school next week and had no friends 
 for anyone who has seen king of the hill '' imagine the houses being lined up 
 all the neighbors were really close 
 our neighbor was a cop and he had an 8 year old son named johnathan 
 johnathan and i became best friends and when school started after summer he showed me around and helped me a lot 
 though johnathan told me to stay away from a boy named ken '' 
 ken was the school bully 
 he would just go around and bully kids because he wanted to 
 i was about <unk> at the time i was short 
 ken was a whopping <unk> 
 ken basically had 7 inches on me and 50 pounds 
 i was super scrawny compared to ken 
 first day i got to school i had one of the best teachers i ever had growing up her name was miss maddy 
 miss maddy was about 40 years old though real nice 
 she would stay after school help students give students bus money if they needed it 
 it turned out ken and i were both in miss maddy 's class 
 on the first day of school i did n't know who ken was though i saw some tall kid in a black shirt and i made eye contact with him 
 he turned and snapped saying what the fuck do you want retard 
 i never heard those words ever in my life and i remember these words like yesterday they are <unk> into my head 
 so the year went on and in february is where the bullying started happening 
 i was on the swing set and ken just came and pushed me off 
 i fell into the sand face first 
 he and his buddies were laughing 
 his <unk> tagged along with him because they were mostly scared of him 
 i came home and told my dad 
 my dad told my principal though the principal turned out to be ken 's father 's <unk> 
 <unk> she would not get ken into <unk> principal simply told my dad no evidence equals no proof 
 my dad was furious and he had a teacher meeting arranged with miss maddy and miss maddy said she will keep an eye out 
 so the bullying happened everyday johnathan witnessed and helped me push off ken one time 
 now johnathan got himself into this 
 well i almost forgot johnathan 's dad was a cop 
 i went to johnathan 's dad one time while he was working on his beautiful red <unk> ford mustang 
 i explained to him and explained that the <unk> wo n't do anything and such and such 
 i told him johnathan is also on ken 's target list 
 basically mr. white johnathan 's dad told me that i should set up a <unk> 
 well i did n't know what that was so he explained to me and i followed 
 mr. white told me that he and his partner and child services would be looking through an identified car and if they see me getting harassed they will come and arrest ken for excessive bullying harassment assault etc 
 so i <unk> to johnathan and <unk> and i made a plan and told mr. white what was going to happen 
 the next day i saw ken walking up to me and johnathan so we both quickly ran past him while saying something <unk> 
 the <unk> we said was meet me at the back alley of corner street i 'll trade you the <unk> pokemon card '' 
 pokemon cards in the school went for quite a bit of money 
 i knew ken wanted that card and would do anything to get his hands on it 
 so i had the card and johnathan and i met up at corner street at 5 pm 
 guess who comes a long at <unk> 
 ken and his buddies 
 basically they walked up and one of his buddies said hey give me the card and no one gets hurt '' 
 we saw a white pick up pull up and just quietly turn off their engines 
 no one noticed not even johnathan 
 i said no this is my card you 've been bullying me all year screw off '' 
 he replied to me give me the card or i will break your arm 
 i said no with a smirk on my face 
 ken ran up with his buddies and head <unk> me 
 mr white his partner and a child services worker jump out of the car and rush to the scene 
 they put handcuffs on ken and his buddies and sit them down at the curb while their parents came 
 ken 's buddies started crying saying that he made them do it and they just kept crying 
 mr. white was n't going to arrest them he was going to scare them so they will never bully again 
 then ken started crying saying how he 's sorry and he will never bully again 
 they bring in a squad car load them up and take them to juvi 
 mr white told me this after it happened 
 in juvi they put them in a holding cell scaring the living shit out of them 
 ken and all his buddies were crying for forgiveness 
 then mr. white led them they 're still handcuffed around juvi and showing them what kinds of kids are there and if they wanted to join them 
 they started crying again 
 then all their parents came picked them up 
 the principal was put under investigation for allowing students to get bullied and ken moved places 
 ken 's buddies then in middle school and high school became straight a students and were friendly with everyone 
 one of them even came out as gay 
 moral of the <unk> do n't bully my friends and i. tl : dr- kids bullied me they got handcuffed and started crying never bullying anyone <unk> ago i worked at a plus-sized <unk> clothing store in a bad part of town 
 the store was part of a national chain and its clothing was designed for the younger crowd 
 our store was not part of a mall but was part of a strip mall that sat right up against some low income housing 
 i really enjoyed working there because i got to help people shop 
 i also enjoyed helping plus-sized girls feel beautiful 
 my pay was barely above minimum wage but my husband works in it and he makes enough money to keep us comfortable 
 there were a few things i didn’t like about my company 
 for one they made us sell magazine subscriptions at the register that were basically a scam it’s 25 <unk> a year now but <unk> be charged an inflated rate next year for a renewal 
 i felt bad because i knew many of my customers were low income and probably wouldn’t remember to cancel 
 the other thing we were required to do is aggressively push our store credit card 
 i wasn’t good at pushing the <unk> or the credit cards and it was no secret that our regional manager was not pleased with my performance 
 despite having amazing sales numbers because my magazine and credit applications were low i was treated poorly by my store manager gina and the regional manager rick 
 out of all of the associates i was the only one that had trouble getting magazine subscribers and credit applicants 
 i later discovered that one of the associates had a boyfriend that was also a drug dealer 
 he would give his drug customers a discount in exchange for their personal information and social security numbers so his girlfriend could run their info on credit applications 
 this associate was best friends with our store manager gina 
 this girl shared all of this information with all of the associates except for me 
 i later heard that i was resented because i was a <unk> white <unk> 
 another crappy part of working at this store was dealing with <unk> 
 even though the <unk> police station was across the street from our store people would come in and try to pull a fast one on us 
 if we knew someone was <unk> one of the associates would start a conversation with a <unk> while the other associate went in the back room to call the police 
 our store had no <unk> systems and it had no security cameras 
 because our amount of <unk> was so high our store was put on probation and we regularly had a company come in and take inventory of our merchandise 
 we knew how much our store was losing every three months 
 corporate sent down some head <unk> from loss <unk> that would interview us one at a time and try to figure out if one of the staff was stealing 
 the man they sent was named jack 
 jack gave me his name and cell number and told me i could call him if i noticed or suspected any of my coworkers was stealing 
 on one of the days that our merchandise was going to be <unk> the regional manager rick arrived 
 this was odd because rick lived in the neighboring state somewhere 
 he must have left his home at 4 am to be there when we opened 
 rick spent the day manipulating the inventory results 
 he would do things like make the people taking inventory scan empty <unk> and inventory shirts twice 
 i went home and wrote down everything that i remembered 
 on july 3rd i received a text from gina 
 she wanted to know if i had set aside a particular shirt to purchase for myself 
 she sent a picture of the shirt 
 i told her it was not mine 
 the following day i noticed gina had posted pictures of herself at a july 4th <unk> wearing the shirt 
 when i got to work the following day i checked the inventory 
 no associates made any purchases at all that week 
 that shirt was never sold in any size at our store but one was missing from the racks 
 gina had stolen it 
 i went home and i created a <unk> presentation with screenshots of my text messages with gina about the shirt details from our inventory and pictures from <unk> facebook page showing she had the shirt 
 i also provided the details of the credit card application scams my coworkers were running 
 i sent this off to jack the loss <unk> guy at corporate and waited 
 within an hour my phone lit up 
 jack told me i would be transferred to any store i chose for coming forward and i was rewarded with a $ 100 gift card 
 he told me they knew about the credit card applications being fake because the same 20 people were applying over and over again 
 i knew that no matter what store i chose rick would still be my boss so i told jack i would think about it 
 when i got to work the following day rick and jack were there 
 gina and her best friend were fired and were already gone 
 within one fucking week i was being written up for not having enough credit apps 
 i quit right then and there 
 i went home and called jack and told him about <unk> inventory <unk> 
 i gave a tip about our magazine program to a major consumer <unk> and they published stuff about it on their website 
 this chain used to have 20 locations in our state 
 now it has two 
 i just looked on linkedin and rick still works for the company 
 oh well 
 i feel like i got revenge 
 edit : i just wanted to add that the story was written by my wife and i posted it up here 
 i guess this is a huge deal because all of my other posts point to the fact that i 'm a dude and the fact that a couple can do things together on reddit is too much to <unk> worked for several years as a campus safety officer at a small college 
 the <unk> majority of students were respectful and willing to be cooperative when we made contact with them 
 there was this one kid who was an <unk> douchebag 
 he insulted us insulted our intelligence we all had degrees some of us officers had advanced degrees claimed we were too stupid to have real jobs 
 he never followed any of our instructions to turn down his stereo hand over his alcohol he was underage or present his campus id when required 
 just an entitled little prick 
 halloween comes around and i 'm working the midnight shift 
 it is cold out 
 we get a call to let a student into his dorm and then his room because he is locked out 
 when my partner and i arrive guess who is locked out 
 mr. entitled prick 
 his halloween costume consists of girls underwear - <unk> and <unk> - and his <unk> 
 he had nowhere for his keys 
 following our department 's rules to the letter i ask him for his school id 
 he does n't have that either no pockets in which to carry his wallet 
 sorry mr. prick 
 i ca n't open the door unless we can identify who you are and verify that you actually live in this building '' 
 no sir 
 i ca n't let you in without your id 
 that is our department 's rules '' 
 no sir i do n't recognize you '' 
 yes sir 
 it certainly is cold out tonight 
 you have a good evening 
 **background** : when i got together with my husband he had a female friend who was basically queen of one of his friend groups 
 i was never really close to her but i liked her well enough even though we were very different she 's more girly '' i 'm more <unk> fast forward 6 years and she and her long time bf are getting married 
 another thing you should know is that none of us are super rich in fact the lovebirds are just a tad bit on the ghetto side 
 bridezilla 's mom however thinks her baby walks on water and they plan a classy wedding ... <unk> classy with expensive 
 thus begins the horror of this year plus engagement or as i like to call it ** '' the money grab '' ** 
 these people have been living together for going on 7 years but they are going for the full white wedding 
 by full i mean : * two engagement parties one with an <unk> that no gifts are to be purchased instead we should bring cash for the money tree 
 * 2 bridal showers including another money tree * <unk> <unk> party * a bridesmaid 's tea at a fancy tea shop ... where the bridesmaids paid as a gift to the <unk> ... * various ladies nights where whichever poor bitches showed up were slave labor for enforced craft time like making favors and <unk> 200 ribbons for hand <unk> invitations 
 not to mention they were all <unk> and <unk> so we did n't even get free food because bridezilla can even throw together some cheese and damn crackers at this time my husband and i were really struggling financially so this constant spending was hard and the guilt was constant oh <unk> 
 i made you one of my twelve bridesmaids out of respect for your relationship with my oldest friend 
 what do you mean you ca n't take 2 unpaid days off of work and spend $ 500 for my weekend long <unk> party '' 
 <unk> tears and phone calls to my husband and other bridesmaids asking why i do n't like her* i learned that due to the honor '' of being one of 12 bridesmaids i would be forced to spend $ <unk> on an ugly <unk> <unk> monstrosity from one of the city 's most expensive bridal <unk> 
 wtf 
 it was the definition of never wearing again '' and probably cost $ 2 to make in china 
 and we had to find navy blue pumps to go with ... finally we get close to the wedding which means <unk> out money for gifts ... because the lovebirds have registered <unk> 
 they are treating this like the price is right 
 they registered for computers and flat screen tv 's 
 they registered for 2000 thread count sheets to go in their ghetto apartment and finally they registered for fancy china 
 i think the china is what finally sent me over the edge 
 bridezilla does not cook 
 bridezilla <unk> not even have a <unk> in her apartment 
 bridezilla does n't have storage big enough for the 12 place settings she registered for 
 and i 'll be <unk> if i pay $ <unk> for a salad bowl for anyone 
 so i find myself with another bridesmaid who is also <unk> sick of this shit standing in macy 's looking over thie registry and i get a bright idea 
 i ask a <unk> to help me find the most useless cheap kitchen shit on this list 
 thus begins : grudge <unk> 
 we track down every useless thing on the list 
 and we price check it to see where we can find the exact thing cheapest 
 special air vented pizza pan for making your red <unk> extra <unk> 
 check 
 counter top mini cupcake maker in the shape of a cupcake that makes 7 mini <unk> a <unk> pan costs like $ 5 this thing 
 $ 27 
 yep 
 countertop <unk> maker shaped like a chili pepper 
 <unk> check 
 soon we have a pile of stuff that is made for garage sales 
 this is shit that no one uses and it 's all from the registry 
 we buy all the shit at macy 's thus getting it off the registry 
 then we go to walmart and target and buy the same shit 
 then we go <unk> to macy 's and return the expensive shit but neglect to give the part of the receipt that says its from a registry 
 so it 's checked off 
 bridesmaid # 2 and i take it home and wrap it all individually so that we have two towers of beautifully wrapped crap 
 crap that we have scraped the price tags off of 
 crap that we have neglected to attach the gift <unk> for 
 and all crap that was specifically requested 
 we show up at the wedding and do our duty 
 everyone <unk> and <unk> when we set our very pretty towers of crap on the gift table 
 after the wedding we immediately go and change in to non horrible dresses and shoes and shove our combined $ 600 dollars worth of navy blue dresses and shoes in a paper sack for immediate <unk> to goodwill 
 we get our drinks from the cash bar and top them off from the <unk> that we wisely snuck in 
 two weeks later i get a call from <unk> trying to <unk> inquire about gift receipts ... were n't they in there 
 i could have sworn i put them in there 
 let me look around the house ... '' couple months after that a very polite thank you note 
 a month ago they had a garage sale ... <unk> single item was out for sale including a very dusty 7 portion cupcake maker ... **tldr : ** prorevenge is getting you *exactly* what you want and having you thank me for it 
 <unk> shit 
 reddit gold 
 thanks kind internet person 
 ** my grandfather had been a soldier <unk> police officer and eventually became a farmer shortly after my father was born 
 we 're from a small community in canada where everyone knows everyone and having a person bully others just is n't okay 
 my grandfather 's farm was quite large 
 acres upon acres of <unk> and grain over 5000 laying <unk> and a sizable herd of pigs 
 but as all <unk> at the time were the local bank owned much of the farm 
 one year was a particularly rough year for them 
 disease had spread through the pig barn and the entire herd was lost 
 this was devastating as it was their most valuable source of income 
 my grandfather had made arrangements with the bank that the grain harvest which normally fed the pigs would be sold to make payments on the loans to the bank 
 the banker was great with this 
 the problem arose when a new loan officer moved to the community and took over my grandfather 's account 
 he demanded payment much earlier than what had been previously agreed 
 the revenge started with my grandfather <unk> the banker out to the farm to discuss terms 
 they were walking through the completely empty pig barn 
 this was the type of barn where the manure from the pigs would flow out of the stalls into a <unk> and down to the end of the barn filling a massive pit 
 because of all of the recent rain in the area and the lack of use of the barn the water had filled this pit and a nice layer of straw dust had settled over the entire thing 
 this caused two things 
 first the concrete <unk> were only raised about an inch over the manure filled water and <unk> unless you knew where you were going or looking down intently it was easy to step off of said walk way 
 well the meeting was n't going well 
 they were walking through the barn to the end of the row and my grandfather was n't too pleased 
 they were walking with the banker in front my grandfather behind him and my father taking up the rear 
 as they came to the end of the row the deep pit of manure was in front of them 
 my father saw that the banker was about to walk straight off of the path so he reached out to grab the banker when out of nowhere my grandfather slapped his hand back and watched as the banker stepped off of the end in his suit and right up to his neck in pig manure 
 they grabbed a rope to help the poor guy out but would n't let him in the house to wash off at all 
 he ended up <unk> himself off in the <unk> and driving back to town smelling like a million bucks 
 needless to say the grain harvest came in a few weeks later and as originally agreed on my grandfather made the <unk> ever reddit post be gentle 
 also pretty long and on mobile so apologies 
 years ago probably 7 at least i was giving my good friend a ride to and from <unk> 
 on the way back i was pulling into the street from a parking lot and a guy was nice enough to stop in the middle of <unk> traffic to let me out 
 as i 'm inching in another guy in the next lane is pulling into the same vacated space 
 i 'm irritated but no huge rush we 're all trapped in traffic anyway 
 we finally pull out onto the main road me in the right lane other douche in the middle to my left 
 suddenly for no apparent reason this douche comes slowly drifting into my lane 
 i tap the horn but she keeps coming forcing me to jump onto the curb and take a solid amount of concrete dust with me 
 coming off the curb forces me into a swerve across the lanes luckily our two cars were leading the pack i 'm shook up a bit and my buddy is already <unk> as all hell so i 'm mad 
 i figure it was some idiot not paying attention so i look to my left now perpendicular to the road and see a dumb bitch in the driver 's seat laughing full on guffaws 
 i 'm furious now so i step out to dead silence beyond her stupid laughs despite the fact that i 'm blocking off 2 and a quarter lanes of traffic with my shitty little <unk> <unk> 
 here is where i should point out i 'm about <unk> '' <unk> out of a vehicle that is approximately half my size 
 i was in decent shape at this point in my life but the contrast of me to my car still makes the gas station attendant laugh to this day he knows what a nice guy i am they do not 
 so anyway i get out silence girl looks up and stops laughing 
 she has her girlfriend with her in the back seat and a dudebro in the passenger seat 
 i unleash a horrible fury of insults and just absolute <unk> at her finally i pause and i hear do n't talk to my girlfriend that way bro '' 
 i snap scream that i 'll talk to his dumb cunt of a woman however the fuck i please and then i start to calm down a bit 
 still <unk> furious but i see clearly that a severe talking to is n't enough 
 i go back to my car grab a bottle of half full water i drop cigarette butts into so i do n't litter and walk up to their car that is trapped <unk> between my car and the backed up traffic 
 <unk> 
 smash it against the driver 's side window past the boyfriend and watch the disgusting sludge that has been baking in the florida heat <unk> down the car 's interior 
 i walked back and drove off no aftermath 
 thanks for dealing with me good people so back in high school aged 15 i realised i was gay but i had n't told anyone at school what i was doing though was hooking up with guys using faceparty old school right my account never had my real name on and only one picture so to find it you really had to know what you were looking for or you were looking for other gay people 
 so the asshat of the school finds my profile some how and starts immediately telling everyone that i 'm gay and he found my profile etc so i started getting questions about it all day long after the first few i started ask the question my profile is pretty private how did he find it without searching for gay guys thus putting the seeds of doubt in place 
 that night when i get home i mocked up a faceparty profile for this guy used his email his pictures one his <unk> from msn and a little sob story about being closeted and not wanting to be found out 
 then screen <unk> the profile and printed off a lot of copies took them into school the next morning and got one onto every desk in his home room and several <unk> around the school 
 it was confirmed the guy searching for gay guys was actually gay and had a secret gay account 
 guy went absolutely off it 
 everyone thought he was gay for weeks 
 best part was after about 3 weeks of everyone taunting him and loving me he tried to take a swing at me 
 i <unk> him and fell to the floor and thus sealed his legacy as the guy who was outsmarted and then beaten up by the gay guy of the school 
 mine was i dated an extremely abusive guy right after my divorce 
 found out his divorce was n't finalized and he went into her house and emptied it so she came home to an empty house 
 he had a $ <unk> car collection he also hid 
 he trusted me by telling me where all the stuff was hidden 
 he had to go to court because the judge ordered him to produce all the belongings 
 he denied knowing where they were 
 after i had enough of his abuse nine months i went into his work and got her phone number off his computer and called her 
 she invited me over and i told her where everything was 
 a week later she got her attorney to tell the judge so he obviously granted her possession of everything 
 i watched from two blocks away all the furniture cars etc get <unk> off by her 
 he had to serve six months in prison because he was found in contempt of court 's orders 
 his business also went under 
 it was <unk> for me to do all of this but totally worth it 
 edit to add : i just divorced for two months when i met him 
 he was the polar opposite if my ex so i thought things would be ok. i was 27 and he was <unk> the first three months were bliss 
 <unk> dining going places and meeting friends 
 all the sudden mr. <unk> showed up and i found out he was going through his fourth divorce 
 then the abuse started 
 calling me fat telling me i dressed like a whore had to always pick out what i wore hated everything i did and when i follows his suggestions it still was n't good enough 
 nothing i did was ever good enough 
 then the physical abuse started 
 grabbing me and shoving me taking my arm and <unk> it until it hurt 
 he was sadistic 
 i was like a science experiment to him 
 he talked about all his <unk> all the time 
 he delighted in fucking with them stalking intimidating 
 the few times we saw her out she had the look of concern on her face when she looked at me 
 i finally had enough if his shit 
 i was <unk> and in the best shape of my life and this old mother fucker was ruining me 
 that 's when i decided to be proactive and make it count 
 i told myself i was n't going to be another woman he succeeded in fucking over so i <unk> up with his last ex and we nailed his ass to the wall 
 i just found this short story on the <unk> subreddit in a thread where someone was asking for advice on how to deal with a scammer : when i was still in school grade 11 i forgot my pencil case in the lobby once and someone took most of the stuff out of it then cut <unk> into it with my <unk> 
 everything that was left were my <unk> which <unk> broke apart and some trash of some rare '' candy inside the case 
 and someone wrote alexander speier '' a guy in my grade on the pencil case but the first and second name were clearly written by different people 
 so my only chances to find out who did this was the name on the pencil case the candy trash or to find a person who was using the stuff i had in my pencil case 
 after school i decided to go through the rooms that were being used by my grade because i thought i might find some of my stuff 
 i ended up finding the empty candy box which was the source of the trash in my pencil case under one of the tables and i ended up finding out that one of the three people at who were sitting at the table was also named alexander 
 i figured out that one of his friends wrote his name on my pencil case while they were having their fun with it and he quickly completed the name with the second name of some other guy and that 's why the names were written by different people 
 his handwriting matched the writing of the second name speier '' and i saw him playing with the neodymium <unk> i had in my pencil case 
 i now had 2 options 
 either take my revenge or go to the principle and try to get my stuff back 
 because the stuff in my case was only worth about <unk> me and a friend of mine started to plan revenge 
 i waited about 1 year so that he does n't get too suspicious at first ... we stole his pencil case i got my neodymium <unk> back and kept waiting 
 3 weeks later i also stole his new pencil case 
 i was now sitting '' on two of his pencil cases 
 i took all the stuff out and threw most of it away nobody could track it all back to me 
 i then slashed the 2 cases the same way he did with mine i also bought the same candy as he did and put the trash into the pencil cases and i wrote alexander speier '' on the two pencil cases in <unk> '' 
 i placed some of my poop in a small plastic bag and placed it in one of the cases and put 5 packs of stink bombs 3 vials each pack in the second one 
 i knew that he always left his bag unattended before going to computer class in the break between the 6th and 7th hour 
 i put the 2 pencil cases into his bag stepped on it to burst the bag with my shit in it and to break the stinky bomb vials or at least most of them ... i did n't really care if all were broken while my friend kept watch 
 we then got back into the building after the break with the other people to see his reaction 
 5 years later i still sometimes feel a little happy when i remember his face and his tears : <unk> the way : he had to throw everything away because he could n't get the smell of the stinky bombs out of his leather bag 
 * it cost me a lot of work and 10€ for the stinky bombs ... but it was worth every minute and every <unk> is from a couple of years ago 
 leaving work and walking towards my car i notice the pressure in one of the tires is pretty low 
 i drive to the closest gas station and pull up to the air compressor it was 75¢ so i put in three quarters and nothing happens 
 so i walk inside wait patiently for the cashier to finish ringing up a customer and then tell her i think the air compressor is broken i put in 75¢ and nothing happened '' 
 she looked at me and said yeah you 'll have to go somewhere else '' 
 i was a bit taken aback so it probably took me a second to say uh well do n't you think you should put up a sign or something 
 and could i get my quarters back so i can go to another gas station '' 
 i want to stress that my tone was was perfectly polite so i was n't prepared for how quickly her attitude turned from <unk> to nasty when she said you 're gon na have to eat it '' 
 if she 'd said <unk> only a manager can do that or something along those lines i probably just would 've left and forgotten about it but i did n't like how she was treating me 
 i kept my cool and with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said is there a manager or something who can help 
 i do n't have any other change and my tire is really low '' 
 nobody else 
 anthony 's the manager he 's not here he 'll be here in the morning '' 
 alright '' i said thank you '' 
 the next morning i call the store and the lady who answers sounds like the same cashier 
 i ask for anthony 
 he left before six he 's getting married today gon na be on his <unk> for two weeks '' 
 oh i was there yesterday and i was told he 'd be in this morning 
 well anyway i had a problem yesterday afternoon the air pump stole my <unk> '' i remember you '' so it was the same lady i told you to come before 6. no one else gon na get your quarters for you '' 
 i started to disagree but realized i was n't going to get anywhere so i said okay thanks anyway '' and hung up 
 the gas station was a franchise of a large brand so i wrote a quick e-mail to their customer service address 
 the next morning i get a phone call from the regional manager at the <unk> which turned out to be a company which owned quite a few gas stations in the area 
 he apologized for my experience said they 've been having trouble with this store and asked me to describe the cashier which i did and he said he 'd look into the matter further 
 he also wanted to reimburse me the 75¢ i told him i was just happy he was taking the matter seriously and that i did n't really care about the money but he mailed me a dollar and a couple of free car washes anyway so that was nice 
 i had n't expected to hear anything else but i was very surprised a few days later when the same manager called me again just to tell me that mrs. nasty attitude had been fired for a string of issues including mine as well as accepting bad checks 
 i felt bad for about half a second but she was mean lied and provided terrible customer service apparently <unk> there are a lot of dogs in my cousin 's <unk> both pets and <unk> 
 one of his neighbors let 's call him dt is a professional dog trainer and an awesome guy all around and lives a few houses down 
 a few houses ahead at the end of the same row lived an old cranky hellspawn bitch who was an overall nightmare 
 let 's call her cranky old bitch cob 
 basically dog owners in our city are not required to clean up after their dogs but it 's a common understanding that this applies to dogs pooping in the wild overgrown patches of <unk> green <unk> <unk> on one side of most roads 
 cranky old bitch had the <unk> <unk> i 've ever seen an untrained bad tempered monster that shit all over the middle of the road never in front of her own house of course 
 people complained but cob did n't do a damn thing 
 cut to a few months ago 
 dt is walking his dog a <unk> <unk> that 's the smartest dog i 've ever seen 
 his dog pauses in the <unk> patch opposite cb 's house to poop 
 cue cb shrieking from her balcony like a harpy : & gt cob : <unk> 
 move your ugly dog away 
 & gt dt : what 
 & gt cob : make your dog poop elsewhere 
 not in front of *my* house 
 & gt dt : & amp # 3232 & amp # 3232 needless to say it 's not very practical to move a dog while he 's pooping so dt ignored her 
 that evening the cob actually made her <unk> pick up the poop with newspapers and then threw it right at dt 's gate 
 my cousin was walking home at the time and saw her doing it and assumed that she 'd finally gone <unk> crazy 
 & gt cousin : what the hell are you doing cob 
 & gt cob : i told him not to allow his dog to poop opposite my house did n't i 
 he can have his filthy dog 's poop back 
 & gt cousin : <unk> cob just turned and walked back to her house cackling like a goddamn witch 
 he called dt outside and told him what happened 
 dt just said i 'll take care of it '' 
 he went and talked to cob but she was an insane unreasonable bitch as usual 
 dt came back really really angry 
 early next morning my cousin saw him walking down towards cob 's house with a small bucket and a few bottles 
 when he came back he asked dt what he 'd done but dt only winked and told him to wait a few days 
 he still has n't told my cousin exactly what he did but apparently he applied some kind of dog pheromone i think 
 to cob 's gate 
 since then <unk> single dog in the <unk> has been pissing at cob 's gate 
 may not seem like much but there are like <unk> stray dogs in the area 
 all pissing at her gate 
 every single day 
 yeah 
 cob <unk> down the gate at first then kept trying to drive the dog 's away but they kept coming back and i think that dt <unk> whatever it was to her gate 
 eventually slovenly hag that she was cob gave up and even stopped washing the urine away 
 now there were <unk> of piss at her gate at all times and occasionally giant <unk> stinking like a <unk> <unk> 
 her own dog contributed to them every day 
 and dt 
 nope he did n't give her any excuse to berate him 
 sickly sweet courtesy 
 expressed concern over her problem 
 walked his dog far away from her house 
 his was probably the only dog that had n't pissed at her gate 
 cob must 've suspected dt but could n't prove that he 'd somehow turned her front gate into a giant dog <unk> 
 she finally had to move to her daughter 's place in a different city 
 tl dr : crazy old bitch throws dog poop at dog trainer 's gate pheromone magic her gate is now a giant doggy <unk> happened 5 years ago 
 i white atheist male was living with my now ex girlfriend <unk> <unk> female 
 her religious parents knew nothing about our relationship and our landlord was aware of our situation and agreed keep it secret if her parents ever showed up unannounced at our apartment 
 he was nice but he demanded to be paid cash and he refused to gave us receipts as proof of payment 
 we had no problem with rent money so everything was fine with us 
 when we found a better apartment we gave him notice that we were moving and he was angry because he did n't want to find new tenants 
 he said it was illegal because we gave him a 2 month notice and the law here says it must be at least a 3 month notice 
 well guess what 
 since we rented the apartment for less than a year the law says a 1 month notice is enough 
 so he called my ex girlfriend family to let them know about us to get revenge 
 her mom cried and her dad was mad at her 
 my ex girlfriend cried and i was mad at him 
 my revenge 
 after we moved out i kept a copy of the lease and i called both canada revenue agency and <unk> revenue agency to let them know about a landlord who possibly did n't pay his taxes 
 a few months later my former landlord called me to insult me 
 he said he never reported his renting income and now he knew he was in deep shit 
 it made me smile 5 years ago and it still makes me smile <unk> the course of my mom 's life she 's experienced quite a bit of <unk> and <unk> as a woman who grew up in <unk> 's michigan and then went to college to study to become a pharmacist a very <unk> woman 
 not the least of which is the one time in 8th grade that her teacher slapped her across the face for <unk> his <unk> and caught no <unk> for it except the <unk> my grandpa unloaded off the books '' according to my uncles but that 's a story for a different time 
 also i apologize for any possible plot points that may seem <unk> since it 's been a few months since i last heard her tell this story 
 anyway in the early <unk> 's my mom who we 'll call sue not her real name was studying at med school at a major <unk> university to become a pharmacist 
 one of the things that my mom has always had was a stellar work ethic and a drive to succeed which showed in her <unk> especially when she scored a 100 % on one of her midterms 
 the course whose exam she got this amazing perfect score on was taught by a professor that she did n't care for 
 according to her this guy was a <unk> middle eastern man who exhibited very conservative sexist ideologies in his interactions with his students but was otherwise a solid teacher 
 even though he was dick my mom did n't let him get to her until she noticed that despite her stellar performance her overall score in the class was a <unk> just barely a failing grade 
 my mom was pissed and confused so she visited her professor 's office to confront him 
 according to her this is how the conversation went down approximately sorry idk how to green text : **mom** : hello professor 
 i 'd like to talk to you about my course grade 
 i scored a 100 % on the midterm but my current course grade is a failing grade 
 what 's seems to be the problem 
 **prof** : it 's near impossible for anyone to score a 100 % on my exams <unk> someone like you 
 you must have cheated 
 **mom** : someone like me 
 i did n't cheat 
 you ca n't prove that 
 **prof** : yes a woman could not <unk> her male peers 's performance 
 and the fact that i ca n't prove it is why i gave you a failing course grade instead of filing you for expulsion 
 **mom** : professor that 's bullshit 
 you ca n't do this to a student who has fairly <unk> the test 
 i 'll have you reported to the dean for discrimination note : idk if this was a thing back then but she said she was gon na report him for something **prof** : look if you can prove that you did n't cheat by taking my <unk> a second time in <unk> then i will <unk> your grade 
 if you score one point less than 100 % then your grade stays where it is 
 although i do n't understand your persistence in this when you should have been married by now like a good girl note : mom was 24 
 my mom has dealt with pricks like this since forever so she decides fuck it and <unk> to beat him at his own stupid game **mom** : fine 
 have it your way 
 when do i take the exam 
 so my mom schedules to <unk> the same exam in a few days 
 she takes it and for the second time she aces it 
 this prof near blew his lid when he realized he had no choice but to grade her fairly and she passed the class that final semester in med school with a <unk> and <unk> on the dean 's list 
 fast forward 3 years now my mom has made a career for herself right out of college with a <unk> company 
 she has worked hard for the past 3 years and has actually achieved a relatively high rank within her company 's regional branch vp of some sector or something 
 so my mom is at a <unk> convention in some city and everyone is wearing <unk> name tags the color of one 's tag <unk> their <unk> in their respective <unk> 
 she 's walking around looking at the different <unk> and schmoozing with corporate or whatever when who does she run into but her old asshole prof 
 he <unk> her and greets her like nothing happened like a prof would to any old <unk> 
 she 's polite and returns his greeting noticing his friendly demeanor and wondering if maybe he 's changed into a better person when he happily drops this question on her so where 's your husband 
 is he running a panel or something '' 
 she had n't met my dad yet but he 's a doctor too an <unk> 
 cute medical love right 
 immediately my mom laughs and says i 'm not married 
 i 'm here representing my company drug corp <unk> '' his smile <unk> when he looks at her name tag so she looks at his and is <unk> satisfied for the second time when she sees that she is a full two colors his superior <unk> <unk> out of med school 
 he somewhat <unk> <unk> her <unk> and moves on as does she 
 i love my mom 
 tl dr asshole sexist med school prof wo n't pass my mom despite her perfect test score since she 's a woman and accuses her of cheating 
 mom <unk> exam and aces it a second time forcing him to grade fairly 
 three years later she bumps into him at a <unk> convention he still assumes she 's some <unk> <unk> turns out she <unk> him 
 go mom 
 **edit** : grammar stuff and age <unk> father told me this story recently about when he worked in an office building a few decades ago 
 apparently someone kept stealing the peanut butter & amp <unk> sandwich out of his brown lunch bag in the fridge most days out of the week 
 after the first one he labeled his bag but it still kept happening 
 he said i was still in diapers at the time 
 when he woke up after a full week of sandwiches missing he decided to <unk> what he found in my diaper that morning for the peanut butter that day went into work and tossed his lunch into the fridge like normal 
 at lunch he went to check the fridge and found the sandwich on top with one big bite missing from the <unk> was incredibly boring in high school 
 <unk> <unk> lead in orchestra <unk> in school paper ... you know the type 
 my parents raised me not to question authority just shut up and do what you 're told 
 then i suffered for two years with my french teacher and totally lost it 
 i took french because i loved the language and genuinely wanted to learn it 
 most of the students in my class were that way since spanish and german were said to be easier and more fun 
 there were a few class clowns but no worse than in any other classes 
 this woman 
 jesus this woman 
 she had no business being a teacher 
 it was no secret that she hated males especially <unk> males 
 the class believes this was at least in part due to the fact that her daughter got knocked up by a black guy and thus named her granddaughter a very <unk> name 
 we knew this because she frequently <unk> her granddaughter and would take her to school forcing us to <unk> her 
 she 'd forego the lesson and instead do something that her granddaughter would like to do like play games 
 this was n't really a problem because who would n't prefer to goof off 
 the issue was that we 'd still be tested on the material she failed to cover that day as if it were our problem that she had to <unk> that day 
 ridiculous 
 on days she was n't babysitting she 'd also answer her phone in the middle of class and talk to her daughter and make plans for the weekend 
 at one point the study <unk> were being ripped out of the french 2 books presumably for cheating purposes 
 she outright accused our class of doing it 
 when one student chimed in and asked why it could n't be one of her other 3 classes she told us we were the only class that would do something like this 
 wow 
 way to <unk> accuse a class of vandalism 
 she was quite a bully and verbally abused students in front of the entire class 
 her biggest pet <unk> included coughing and <unk> 
 should a student <unk> or cough she 'd become irate and tell them how rude it is even if they covered their mouth 
 after a good 5 minutes of public abuse she 'd send them out of the classroom to deal with them later '' and would subsequently either leave the door open while yelling at them outside or simply forget about them 
 she left one student outside in the rain for nearly the entire 50-minute class period and then when reminded could n't recall why she sent him out there in the first place 
 one time she sent the two class clowns outside together for disrupting the class 
 apparently one of them let out a fart so rancid that the other puked on the asphalt 
 when the teacher went outside to talk to them she got angry at this for some bizarre reason and forced the one that puked to clean it up 
 with a <unk> cup 
 the bell rang and class let out in the middle of this and she forced him to stay and continue cleaning it up much to his humiliation 
 when the class clown keeps his <unk> head down and does n't have any jokes to throw back at the people teasing him you know the punishment went too far 
 anyways this lady was a waste of teaching space 
 so i decided to type up an anonymous letter saying so 
 i <unk> everything she does that is more <unk> to the class than the class clowns ever could be 
 i told her that she is <unk> us of an education 
 i requested that the class environment change and that she stop publicly berating students and discipline them privately 
 i was firm yet polite in telling her that if nothing changes i will be going to the principal 
 this is still my teacher and she deserves a chance 
 however i stopped caring about respect when she spent the entire class period the next day yelling at the whole class insulting me to everyone without even knowing it was me 
 i was a coward rude disrespectful i should teach the class myself i do n't know what i 'm talking about no one agrees with me she 's a fantastic teacher she 's not racist or sexist etc etc 
 she shared my private letter with the class and said some pretty humiliating things about this ghost writer 
 screw this woman 
 i gave her two months to change things around 
 they got <unk> worse 
 so i did what i threatened to do - wrote another anonymous letter to the principal 
 i explained everything and pleaded for help 
 she was n't in class the next day and i guess there was n't even time for a sub to be called because a security guard sat in on the class 
 i was the only one that knew why 
 we had a sub for the rest of the week and everyone was making speculation as to why she 's been gone for so long 
 some even happily joked that she died or has cancer 
 i sat quietly just waiting for the outcome 
 the next week she returns to class with a somewhat different attitude and announces to the class that she has been offered early retirement and she is going to take it 
 holy shit 
 i just got my french teacher fired 
 bitch totally deserved it 
 last day of class party period 
 teacher could n't care less about the class or the school since she 's gotten the can 
 one of my classmates sitting near me brought up the letter wondering if that 's what got her fired 
 yep 
 it did 
 how are you so sure '' they asked 
 because i wrote it stupid 
 <unk> shit 
 the quiet girl got the teacher fired 
 the next year in french 3 everybody freaking loved me 
 i was suddenly ms. popular in one class the one that saved us and got a new teacher 
 the teacher hired for the next year was the sub we had for that week the teacher was getting fired ... and she knew 
 she told me i hope i can do better than ms. teacher because i do n't want the same thing to happen to me 
 in order to keep a long story short i wo n't go into full detail but here 's some backstory 
 i moved in to a new basement apartment with two girl friends from school 
 the landlords lived upstairs with family 
 within the first week we had been experiencing harassment not only from the landlord but the landlord 's family as well 
 we were being harassed weekly 
 it had gotten so bad that we had called the cops on them numerous times 
 they refused to perform basic repairs in our unit they came around screaming and swearing in our faces over petty stuff because it was their house '' and they felt invincible 
 little do they know that i know my rights and am not afraid to stand up for myself 
 eventually we got a notice that they were trying to evict us 
 this notice included all the things we supposedly did to them '' 
 they accused us of assaulting them housing an illegal grow op none of us smoke in the slightest destroying city property and <unk> them in to our unit to harass and assault them 
 well after this all happened i went in to super research mode in which i tried to dig up as many of my rights as possible to use against them when it came time 
 i found out that in my city you must possess a rental license in order to legally rent a part of your home 
 i then found out that particular house did not possess one they had been <unk> fees and laws for years and they could n't obtain a license due to safety and zoning issues 
 i found out that if the city were to find out the landlords could be faced with a large fine and we would be evicted 
 what did we have to lose 
 they were trying to evict us anyway 
 so i called the city and alerted them to the illegal rental unit the landlords were running 
 fast forward a few weeks to our trial date 
 turns out the landlords wanted to settle out of trial because someone had informed the city of their rental unit and they could not obtain a proper license 
 if the city were to evict us the landlords would be in violation of the tenancy agreement and we would have won our case and then some 
 we settled on termination of our lease and our deposit was to be returned to us 
 oh and they can also never rent that apartment again because it is not legal to do so 
 tl dr - landlords harassed us from the get go 
 they made our lives hell for the time we rented 
 turns out a bit of research for clarification revealed a city <unk> and the landlords are forced to cease renting <unk> 
 ever since i was a little girl i was always <unk> bullied 
 mostly it was because of the fact that i had a male body 
 i 'm a <unk> woman but it took me years to figure that out so for the time that i was in public school i was just a very effeminate male bodied kid 
 obviously that tends to draw the wrong kind of attention with ease and ended up being one of the main reasons that i was bullied for several years 
 there was this one bully in particular though who throughout several years would never let up let 's call him shane 
 most bullies would eventually stop after bullying me after awhile because they got bored this all happened in detroit public schools so the staff there usually did n't care or thought the bullying of a effeminate male bodied person was justified to beat the <unk> out of me as some called it shane was part of a small core group though that continued to stick around and make my life hell for several years 
 for years his bullying was most of the standard physical violence and name calling 
 around fifth grade though his bullying changed a bit and got weird 
 he still did the standard bully practices but after awhile he started sexually harassing me 
 to this day my theory is that he is a closeted gay man 
 everyday he would at least feel me up inappropriately grabbing my butt feeling up my chest or crotch and say weird things like you 'd probably enjoy this because you 're a faggot '' 
 and that was just the daily minimum 
 everyday i 'd come crying to the principle or other adults asking for help and they 'd ignore me and tell me to stop complaining and on a few instances i was told it was my fault no matter what i did no one would help me 
 fast forward again to seventh grade shane is still pulling this shit on an almost daily basis to the point where i have become numb to it but i still feel rage towards him and i plotted everyday on how i would end his life 
 finally my day came we had a new gym teacher lets call him nace come in who was not from around the area and you could tell because he was bright <unk> delightful and would n't let students get away with anything because the horrible city had n't gotten to him yet 
 he had also just recently got his degree so he was fairly new to teaching and fairly hopeful of what he would accomplish 
 i knew that this guy would be the key to finally bringing shane down the problem was finding the perfect time to strike 
 one day shane made a bad move while we were in the locker rooms changing he brought along some of his buddies and trapped me in a part of the locker room and proceeded to call me degrading and bigoted insults while taking photos of me changing i knew this was the time to strike 
 we had some dusty ass gym floors because the janitors never really cleaned up the gym so i got some on my fingers and rubbed it really hard into my eyes so i 'd start tearing up all over the place and i went over crying to nace and told him what happened 
 his jaw dropped to the floor and he immediately ran over to shane and dragged him into his office 
 later nace pulled me into his office and told me what he did he confiscated his phone and found the pics on it the immediately sent the kid home and phoned the police 
 at this point i was freaking out because i did n't want to go and testify against the guy in court i was afraid he 'd find a way to make my life worse but nace told me not to worry and that he 'd take care of it 
 several months later nace pulled me into his office again and told me the whole story that he went to court for me and told the people there that he had to <unk> shane 's phone and that he immediately phoned the police after he found the photos on the phone and that shane got thrown away for possession of child pornography but they went a bit easier on him since he was a kid himself 
 fast forward to a few months ago i no longer live in detroit i 'm now off in a nice quiet city going to college and getting my degree in it 
 i went back to detroit though to visit some people and shock a few people with my recent <unk> because i love the dumb look people give me when they see me as the happy woman i am now 
 while i was in a store getting some snacks for a night of counter strike with an old friend of mine i ran into shane at the store 
 i recognized him but he did n't recognize me let 's face it though not a lot of old people i know recognize me now 
 i was happy to see that it looked like his life was going nowhere he looked like shit bought his snacks with foodstamps and has a house arrest <unk> <unk> on 
 i left that store with a bag full of <unk> treats and the best feeling in the world knowing that everything in my life was now awesome and his life was in the <unk> 
 tl dr possibly super closeted gay man bullies and sexually <unk> me for most of grade school and some of middle school takes nude pictures of me on his phone i then use that to put him away for awhile 
 i run into him again a few months ago he does n't recognize me but i recognize him and i become deeply satisfied when i learn his life is now shit and my life is going pretty awesome 
 i meant to share this story some time ago but it slipped away from me until i remembered today 
 it 's a shame to keep it to myself although it is a little sad in places but i hope you can enjoy it 
 about a year ago around this time my mother was approaching her last days 
 she had lived a hard life and it caught up with her all too quickly 
 she did n't have much left to her name but she made sure i had possession of her car 
 it was an absolute wreck despite having a good engine and i knew it would never sell but it was all she had to give 
 not long after she had passed away i was contacted by the welfare type agency she had been getting support from 
 they said my mothers <unk> or <unk> were entitled to sum of money to help pay for final arrangements 
 i was happy to hear this as i had had to pay for the funeral by myself and the expense had really hurt me 
 however they didnt want to give the money to me 
 i was a year outside their range for <unk> 
 instead since my parents had divorced an eternity ago they wanted to give the money to my younger sister 
 my deadbeat sister 
 who had run out on my mother while she was ill stolen from her to buy drugs and only showed up at her death bed to scream at her 
 they told me the money would go to her or it would <unk> 
 i was torn over what to do but remembered that my sister had recently had her car impounded 
 with cold <unk> i knew what i needed to do 
 i gave them my sisters contact info and had my father get in touch with my sister 
 i would sell '' her the car for the majority of what they were giving her which was honestly not a terrible deal 
 she tried to <unk> but she needed a car too badly 
 a week later fighting against her wanting to meet up at every shady place imaginable we meet up in a public spot and made the exchange 
 i had a friend with me at the time for backup and he could do nothing but stare <unk> eyed at the events that took place 
 it 's easiest if i lay them out like this 
 - she had blown her portion of the money on a fair amount of meth and was stoned out of her mind 
 - after taking the car from me she learned that it 's tank was on <unk> 
 she tried to argue and the three creepy dudes she had with her wanted to make a scene but they could n't do a thing while we stood in a <unk> supermarket parking lot 
 - as they drove off i informed my friend that i had been unable to find the title for the vehicle and that it was still registered under my mothers name and was most certainly **not** in the <unk> box of that car 
 additionally my sister has an expired license and has a warrant out for her arrest due to evading parole 
 i very nearly dialed the non emergency line to report the car as stolen after this 
 i should have considering she was driving it while fucked up and could have killed someone but my father had begged me to give her a chance 
 either way it ended up with the same result 
 a week later the car was found abandoned and was impounded just like her previous car 
 she was picked up as well and learned that she was going to *real* prison this time instead of a short <unk> in a youth correction center 
 she 's still there now and will be for the next several years 
 i may not have put her there myself but i unloaded a burden onto her and got what should have rightfully gone to me back first 
 throwaway for obvious reasons 
 about a month ago one of my friends came over to hang out 
 we were having a good time but he looked nervous to the point that it was killing me 
 i had to ask what was bothering him and that was where my life got turned around 
 he showed me a facebook post from my upstairs neighbor we live in an apartment that stated that she was going to break into my apartment and break the living shit out of all our electronics because we 're too loud '' 
 one of the major complaints i have about this apartment complex is that the walls between apartments on the same level are like steel 
 my neighbors can be throwing a party and i would have no idea 
 however the ceiling is paper thin and you can hear conversations <unk> 
 i 've lived in dorm rooms that have the same type of material surrounding the room : ceiling floor and walls 
 i 'm used to it 
 however my neighbors have way too high of expectations living in an apartment complex 
 when we first moved in they constantly commented on hearing our conversations and how they know what tv shows we watched 
 at first it was kind of laughable but the comments turned into complaints 
 my husband told the male neighbor his friend that there 's nothing he can do about it at all except move out 
 this is out of the equation since we are waiting for our house to be build new construction and we refuse to break a lease to move to another apartment for a few months only to move into our house 
 up until last month we have n't heard too much 
 the facebook post was absolutely shocking and i was pissed 
 if this woman publicly threatened my property what else would she be capable of doing 
 i confronted the situation and told her to take down the post 
 she said some nasty things to me and i told her that my request was simple : you should not go to social media to deal with your issues and you need to direct your concern to the person directly involved 
 anyway my husband 's aunt is a lawyer 
 she provides us help with legal situations if necessary and has been a big help for some of our other relatives 
 over christmas break i was talking to her about the situation and explained how i did n't feel safe 
 this woman has a history of drug abuse and violence that i do n't trust 
 in addition i 'm currently 7 weeks pregnant and want to protect myself and the baby 
 my lawyer then pointed out that because of my profession as a public official this threat and any future aggression toward me is a class 3 felony in my state that would result in <unk> years in prison if convicted 
 i was absolutely shocked that i would qualify under that law 's specific protection and my lawyer suggested that she would write a letter detailing possible legal action if this woman decides to do anything against me 
 the letter was delivered today 
 i heard a lot of holy shit '' from upstairs and i 'm guessing that she called her husband to complain about me 
 i 'm sitting downstairs dealing with my life 
 after all i 'm battling morning <unk> 4-5 times a day and will be responsible for a life soon 
 edit : i also feel horrible that the husband of the upstairs neighbor is one of my husband 's friends 
 i know that you can choose your friends but ca n't choose their significant others 
 i think the general hatred toward us was not expected by my husband and he is hurt that someone would allow their so to do the to their <unk> kid sister was friends with the neighbor girl let 's call her biana 
 biana was a total bitch with a very <unk> view of the neighborhood 
 she had a seething hatred for me 
 i was out playing in the yard and went to talk to my sister 
 i round the bushes and discovered biana was with her and i had dared approach without permission from the bitch queen 
 i do n't know why i decided to continue walking over to talk to my sister as i was a <unk> kid and her friend was constantly <unk> away at me 
 she eventually interrupted us 
 cuntbeast : you 're annoying '' 
 me : i 'm okay with it '' 
 cuntbeast : leave '' me : i live here '' 
 cuntbeast : if you do n't leave i am going to kick you in the shin '' 
 me : you are wearing <unk> <unk> 
 even you are n't that mean '' 
 well it turns out she was that mean 
 i took that <unk> skate right to the right shin 
 my sister and the dragon just walked away 
 the next day i answer the front door and it was biana 
 cuntbeast : oh it 's you 
 is my sister home '' 
 me : i do n't know '' 
 <unk> front <unk> cuntbeast : you could at least check '' 
 i searched my sister if for no other reason than to get the dragon off of my porch and in checking her room found her <unk> 
 she was too lazy to put the dress back on her after she wore it but must have felt bad about leaving it naked as it was wearing her underwear 
 her underwear with a huge <unk> on it 
 i had a plan 
 i could scare the shit out of biana and embarrass my kid sister for leaving me there after the bitch kicked me 
 i went to my mother 's room with the giant doll which was over the front door of the house climbed out the window onto the roof of the porch and threw the doll to the sidewalk behind biana screaming <unk> do n't '' 
 the doll hit the ground the arm broke off and flew a few feet away biana screamed a grade-a horror movie scream and my sister rounded the corner seeing her <unk> <unk> doll <unk> her seemingly fearless friend with terror 
 biana actually thought i threw my sister off the roof 
 she never bothered me again 
 first post 
 be <unk> apologies for the length 
 there is a tl dr at the bottom 
 okay 
 so i am a bouncer 
 proof : username so i work at this fairly popular bar in a college town 
 it 's a good gig and i get paid enough to live and have a good time 
 the first few months i worked there were awesome 
 getting paid to be big on slow nights talking to girls all night and after the bar closes we get to go behind the bar and take shots for free for as long as it takes the manager to count all the tips 
 it was awesome 
 so after a few months of working there my grades start to slip and i tell my manager that i want to take a month off to focus on my grades 
 my manager is a cool dude and he says that 's fine come back when you 're ready 
 so i get my grades up and come back a month later ready to work 
 a new bouncer has been hired who used to work there a few years ago 
 he 's big and dumb so we 'll call him lump 
 so lump thinks he 's hot shit coming back to his old stomping grounds 
 he even goes as far to tell all the other bouncers that our manager made him the head of security 
 he was n't 
 i 'm a pretty laid back guy so i did n't care who was head of security as long as i 'm getting paid 
 well lump is a huge alcoholic 
 he would come to work at <unk> drunk as shit and try to order all the other bouncers around 
 lump was a better bouncer than me simply because he was a huge asshole to everyone so i did n't give a shit what he asked me to do as long as it was n't too <unk> and i was n't the only one doing it 
 sometimes he was a cool guy 
 well other times he would come in to work drunker than a one eyed <unk> swimming backwards in a bird bath and order the other bouncers around while he sat on his fat ass and drank beer that he stole we were n't supposed to drink while on duty 
 i usually did not say anything because i did n't care to have a hostile work environment 
 well one day he went too far 
 it was closing time and i went back behind the bar and me and my buddy he can be al did something 15 shots in 20 minutes 
 we were feeling good 
 there 's usually an after party at one of my coworkers houses were we get <unk> 
 lump was trying to go to this party and nobody was sure who 's house it was at 
 so it 's me al and lump siting outside of the bar drinking 
 lump tells us to get in his truck and lets go to the party 
 me and al do n't want to ride with lump because he 's drunk as shit and it 's raining really hard 
 well this upsets lump and him and al get into a big argument 
 out of nowhere lump <unk> al to the ground and yells fuck you 
 gets in his truck and swerves off 
 i felt like a bitch because i was so shitfaced that i did n't even know al got hit until after lump drove away 
 so me and al sat outside drinking and <unk> what we would do about lump 
 remember how i said lump used to work at the bar and then came back 
 yeah it was because he had gotten fired from his last 2 jobs for being so drunk all the time so he came to a place where he could get drunk and get paid 
 lump drove home drunk every night 
 so one night after the bar was closed me and al were sitting outside waiting for lump to leave 
 he stumbles out of the front door gets in his truck and swerves away 
 i quickly pull out my phone and dial <unk> i tell them that i believe there is a drunk driver on the road 
 he 's leaving name of bar '' and heading towards where he lives '' in a red dodge pickup 
 they say thank you for the information 
 so me an al catch a ride with one of our sober friends and low and behold what do we see 
 lump 's truck on the side of the road and lump in the back of a cop car 
 there were two cops on the route that lump was taking 
 me and al take appropriate shots at after party to celebrate 
 aftermath lump did not come in to work the next night 
 or all that week 
 my boss was informed by one of the local cops that <unk> the bar that lump assaulted one of the <unk> in a rage and that he was in jail awaiting trial for both that and dui 
 it does n't pay to be a bully lump 
 tl dr worked with an alcoholic asshole at a bar who often drove home drunk 
 he punched my friend so we called the cops on him while he was driving drunk 
 he get mad assaults one of the cops and is in jail 
 also <unk> 8 years ago my girlfriends friend had just graduated from university 
 she had managed to land a very high paying job in the private sector 
 she would constantly brag about how she was making soooo much money '' and how she had an expensive car 
 she would tell all her friends they need to get their asses in gear so everyone could be like her 
 this girl was the definition of bitch '' fast forward about 2 years she has now landed a new higher paying job with the government 
 after being with them for about a year she hurts '' her back and is on long-term disability for months and there is no sign of her going back to work anytime soon 
 you would think that someone with an injured back would not do a lot of physical activity like <unk> partying at the bars etc 
 she had a desk job and everyone knew she was faking 
 the best part about all this 
 she was posting pictures and adding comments on facebook about all the fun '' she was having 
 after months of <unk> this i did some research and tracked down the name of the insurance company that handles government workers 
 i filed an anonymous complaint and thought nothing would happen 
 about a year later i found out she had been sued by the government for over $ <unk> in claimed wages while she was on disability 
 she tried to fight it in court but the insurance company had hired a private investigator and tracked her every move 
 they had screen grabs of her facebook <unk> as well as photos taken by the investigator from his car of her doing <unk> activities proving her back was ok. she lost the fight and had to pay the $ <unk> 
 she lost her job went bankrupt and had to move back in with her parents 
 she is currently a <unk> year old unemployed single woman living in an isolated rural area with her parents 
 edit : i love the idea from <unk> about sending her the card 
 unfortunately she still does n't know i did it and no one else does so i ca n't send the card 
 however an anonymous <unk> might work 
 thanks for the suggestions 
 even my girlfriend who is now my wife does n't <unk> all went down about 5 years ago 
 me and my then wife were married for about 3 years at that point 
 she came from a very conservative christian family 
 her parents never liked me because 1 i was n't religious and 2 i 'm a <unk> 
 they tried their best to convince her not to marry me but to no avail 
 looking back i wish they had convinced her to not marry me 
 at some point during the marriage my wife began to withdraw sexually 
 we went from having sex 3 times a week to 3 times a month to once a month 
 she told me that she did n't really like having sex that much and that she did it mostly to please me 
 what i did n't know was that she did n't want to have that much sex with me because she was getting her dick elsewhere 
 how did i find out 
 well my wife was using my laptop her laptop was being repaired and accidentally clicked the remember me box on her e-mail 
 i went to check my e-mail and it <unk> to hers 
 i saw every message she sent to this guy and basically confirmed that she was cheating on me 
 like any <unk> person who realizes their marriage is over i filed for divorce 
 also i alerted the other man 's gf and she promptly dumped him 
 now like i stated before her parents never really liked me 
 when they found out i was <unk> her they went ballistic 
 apparently she lied to them and said that i cheated on her 
 i kept getting hateful e-mails from them every other week 
 after our divorce was final i told her parents that she cheated on me and sent them proof 
 her dad <unk> me saying he was sorry and that he 's disappointed in his daughter 
 all i replied with was well now you know what kind of person your daughter is 
 never contact me again '' 
 neither of them have contacted me since 
 about a year after our divorce i get a long e-mail from my ex with the subject as thanks '' 
 i thought it would be some sort of thank you letter but it was far from that 
 some of it read like this : thanks for making my parents hate me '' thanks for driving me to cheat on you '' thanks for ruining my life '' that was the last i ever heard of her 
 her parents disowned her and she was the shame of the small town she came from 
 according to facebook she now lives in australia but considering she has n't posted anything in 3 years i might be wrong 
 also remember the gf of the guy my wife was cheating on me with 
 that woman is now my fiancee 
 <unk> 
 tl dr : wife cheats on me her parents disown her and i 'm engaged to the other man ex gf 
 win 
 one of my previous offices was on the top floor of a building that had retail shops on the ground floor and the building was part of an outdoor mall 
 the primary shopping clientele were upper class attractive white women and their spoiled kids 
 i worked for a tech startup and i rode my <unk> to work 
 we only had 2 reserved spots for our company of 5 which meant most of us had to park <unk> out in the back of the mall parking lot after lunch 
 since i rode a motorcycle i started just using the motorcycle parking that was about 25 yards from the elevator rather than the full-size parking spots that i would 've had to use if i drove a car 
 one day i return from lunch to find a full-size buick suv parked perpendicular across 3 motorcycle spots which are very clearly marked and the front half of the truck is <unk> into the back half of a spot that 's meant for a car to be parallel parked against the curb 
 the front door was positioned so that when the driver got out of her suv she would have been standing on <unk> that said motorcycle parking only '' 
 so being the kind of person that hates entitlement ... i proceeded to roll my bike right up against the suv so that the driver would n't be able to get in using the drivers door and probably would n't be able to leave without knocking my bike over or moving it 
 since i had about 20 minutes left in my lunch break i sat down on a bench under a tree across the street and just read articles on my phone 
 after about 15 minutes a woman comes up to the suv with 2 teenage girls 
 between the 3 of them i 'd <unk> they had the <unk> of a flea and had worked a cumulative 0 days in their lives 
 she walks around the truck from the passenger side and just stops dead when she sees my bike 
 she calls the 2 girls over and they all share the same omg i cant even '' expression 
 i walk over to my bike make sure my <unk> are locked really just an excuse to make my presence known and turn to walk away 
 she asks me if i can move and i look at my watch and say sorry i 'm on my lunch break and i 'm outta time 
 got ta run '' 
 and start walking away 
 she yells how am i supposed to get out '' 
 and i respond with do n't know 
 should 've thought about that before parking in motorcycle parking '' and keep walking 
 she threatened to move my bike so i stopped turned and told her i 've already got a picture of your license plate 
 if my bike has a single scratch when i get out of work tonight i 'll just contact your insurance company '' 
 the look on her face was incredible but the giggles from her presumably daughter and her friend were even better 
 apparently they liked seeing someone treat mom like she treats people 
 i walked back to my office which conveniently overlooked the motorcycle parking and called my coworkers over to watch the scene unfold 
 after a bit she flagged down security who were clueless and of no help to her 
 she made some phone calls 
 i 'd imagine she called <unk> for a solution 
 eventually she resorted to climbing in from the passenger side which was funny to watch 
 mainly because it was <unk> 
 once she was in the drivers seat the full <unk> of the situation <unk> in 
 because she had <unk> herself into a space that was n't a proper parking spot the <unk> car in front of her and the curb behind her meant she was stuck like chuck 
 until this point i 'd consumed about 40 minutes of her day 
 i 'd already gotten back to work after about the 10 minute mark but was casually <unk> the scene 
 at some point around an hour in the car in front of her left which gave her enough room to leave 
 the satisfaction was so good that the whole <unk> became something of a routine for me although she was the only one i was able to confront 
 apparently my antics earned me a reputation with mall security also 
 not only did they start actually <unk> the situation and telling assholes not to park there but they also tried to give me a lecture one evening about how i 'm causing problems 
 i reminded them that since i was n't an employee of the mall or any of its tenants they had 0 authority over me and if they were actually doing their job i would n't have to be causing problems '' and the lecture ended pretty quick 
 tl dr : do n't park in motorcycle spots with your giant soccer mom <unk> dear reddit is is a story of justice 
 a tale of evil clients and <unk> in shining qa departments 
 & amp nbsp **the setting : ** our company runs a set of <unk> with a light website for managing reports on data all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but do n't want to manage a database to sit behind it 
 **the heroes : ** i work as a lowly qa tech in a qa department of about 8. i 've been working in this place for about 5 years now and i 'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients 
 they trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there 's anything i want to ask about 
 my boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of how to earn respect 
 the guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and <unk> politics 
 great boss 
 my good friend who we 'll call greg works as a fairly senior member of the customer support department 
 greg 's got my back and i 've got his 
 if he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then i 'll help him out 
 **the villain : ** the client 's project manager who we 'll <unk> call ... douche was tasked with being the <unk> for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or <unk> incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered 
 when paired together these things often mean that bad things will happen 
 to make things worse this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it 
 after all he is a paying customer 
 **the pledge : ** the client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom api which we expose on our soap interface 
 it was a good feature and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time 
 implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off 
 all my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work <unk> fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails 
 one exchange with douche on this topic went thus : & gt *me : * hi douche its derp at & lt company & gt 
 just calling <unk> ... & gt *douche : * oh hi yeah the <unk> at & lt company & gt 
 <unk> it going 
 it should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call hence why this was obviously my fault 
 & gt *me <unk> my tongue : * i 'm ... i 'm ok ... thanks 
 just calling about your requirements on the api which you sent <unk> ... & gt *douche : * oh this again 
 haven’t you finished that yet 
 & gt *me : * well no 
 you 'll remember that we 've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you 've been <unk> ... & gt *douche : * oh for the love <unk> why is it taking so long 
 & gt *me : * that 's what i wanted to ask about 
 requirement <unk> says its supposed to calculate x but lower down it states the <unk> you want it to use 
 the problem is that this equation does n't actually represent that val ... & gt *douche : * look you 're supposed to follow the specification i 've written so just do it 
 i do n't want to hear about this again until its done 
 the next day my boss tells me that douche complained about me to his account manager saying that i was being offensive and was questioning his competency 
 he can read minds 
 i then completed this piece of work ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction 
 **the turn : ** after the best part of 6 months and the client is about to go live with their site 
 they 've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that 's when their marketing campaign said it would 
 because of these tight deadlines they signed it off in our acceptance testing <unk> and we considered the work to be complete 
 i had all but forgotten that previous conversation with douche 
 about 3pm friday afternoon greg from cs calls me up says he 's got an issue with douche 
 greg now knows first hand how <unk> douche can be 
 this is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system any issues they had <unk> were not development issues but customer support issues 
 i make my way over to cs land and this is where things get fun 
 & gt *me : * <unk> greg 
 sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features & gt *greg : * hey <unk> ever worked on this new api that went up for & lt client_name & gt 
 & gt *me : * yeah i did the verification process on it 
 what do you want to know 
 & gt *greg : * the client seems to think it does n't work 
 & gt *me : * it was implemented to the letter 
 plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out have n't they 
 & gt *greg : * yeah that 's what i thought when i read the documentation 
 ok leave it with me and i 'll let douche know 
 i head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation i have on this feature because i know exactly what 's coming next 
 after not too long steve the account manager for douche storms into qa and straight into boss office 
 there 's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually i 'm called in 
 & gt *steve : * would you care to explain this 
 steve points at an email on boss screen 
 i go in for a closer inspection and it 's an email from douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a <unk> because the api has <unk> not been tested at <unk> 
 i 'm surprised steve believes this because he knows me and i 've worked on various projects for him in the past 
 & gt *me : * i was firmly told my mr douche that i was to <unk> it to the specification 
 & gt *steve : * but the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense 
 it does n't make sense 
 & gt *boss : * derp what did the specification say about this 
 & gt *me : * i can grab the documentation from my desk if you like 
 & gt *boss : * i think that would be a good idea 
 i go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me wanting to know what 's going on 
 on the way back i see boss trying to calm steve down 
 & gt *me : * here it is 
 i slide it across the desk and take a seat 
 steve and boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to 
 steve turns a little pale and boss smiles 
 & gt *steve : * but that makes no sense 
 & gt *me : * i know 
 & gt *steve : * why did n't you raise this with the client 
 & gt *me : * i did 
 i then was accused of insulting the <unk> project manager and calling him incompetent 
 & gt *boss : * who wrote this specification 
 & gt *me : * douche over on their side did 
 i 'm pretty sure you two would have been cc 'd on the email when it came across 
 & gt *steve : * well what are we going to do 
 we have to fix this before they go live on sunday 
 it 's now <unk> friday afternoon & gt *boss : * no chance 
 we only release new code on monday or tuesday unless it 's a priority 1 issue 
 even then this is an api that multiple clients are now using and we 'll have to be careful not to break their <unk> 
 & gt *me : * steve you might want to look at section 21 on that document 
 steve quickly <unk> to this section of the documentation where the final <unk> states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work 
 steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered 
 that and i 've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past 
 & gt *steve : * ok wait there 
 steve now stands a chance to make a <unk> amount of commission 
 the client wrote the requirements signed off the requirements signed off the work in acceptance testing and have only 32 hours before they launch 
 they will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight 
 <unk> prestige : *** it 's <unk> and i am considering what i 'll spend my weekend doing 
 boss walks out of his office and comes over to me 
 & gt *boss : * can you just join me on a conference call 
 & gt *me : * if it 's quick 
 & gt *boss : * that 's up to you really 
 intrigued i follow him into his office where i can hear a much more humble sounding douche on the phone explaining to steve what needs to be done 
 & gt *boss : * steve i have derp here do you want to explain what the plan is 
 & gt *steve : * derp we really need to get this sorted 
 you worked on the original feature so you 'll know the best way to test this 
 we 're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we 'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for sunday 
 we <unk> we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients 
 & gt *douche : * i really need you to help me out here mate otherwise it 'll really hit the fan over here 
 i pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice 
 & gt *me : * i 've already made plans for this weekend and ... & gt *douche : * derp seriously you have to help me out here 
 & gt *me : * i don’t really feel like it 
 & gt *douche : * well someone needs to fix this 
 & gt *boss : * it 's 5pm on a friday 
 most staff are on their way home or out the door 
 sorry steve but it looks like it 'll have to wait until next week 
 douche <unk> down the phone and once this torrent of abuse <unk> steve lets me go back to my desk 
 i 'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings 
 & gt *me : * & lt company & gt derp <unk> ... & gt *douche : * please i need you to do this 
 & gt *me : * you need to sort this out and calling me wo n't help you 
 & gt *douche : * please i 'm sorry just help me out 
 & gt *me : * you have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we 've spoken 
 your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you 're here right now 
 i did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way 
 i am not helping you 
 & gt *douche : * please ... he 's actually crying 
 you can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky 
 so i hang up and leave for my weekend 
 **the end : ** monday rolls around and steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who 's <unk> the fix to the api 
 & gt *steve : * so derp this is <unk> 
 another project manager for & lt client_name & gt 
 & gt *me : * is douche not working on this project 
 & gt <unk> : * douche no longer works here 
 tl dr : douche pm for client writes spec for api 
 <unk> logic makes no sense pm thinks he 's <unk> 
 qa tech questions logic gets reported for being insulting 
 client does n't test the api signs it off anyway 
 it hits the fan release date is ruined 
 pm is in deep and <unk> for help 
 qa tech hangs up and enjoys weekend even <unk> for the triple posts everyone 
 i knew this would be a terribly long post so i broke it up to make it slightly easier to read but here is everything in 1 post 
 **part 1 - betrayal and <unk> this is a long one but it made me feel oh so good 
 in my high school there was a counselor who just did n't like me 
 well to put it more <unk> he did n't like my family 
 his daughter and my eldest sister had been academic <unk> their senior year and my sister won a <unk> award over the counselor 's daughter 
 it did n't help that my second sister actively pissed this guy off by ignoring him and going over his head for things she was the <unk> and went out of her way to not involve him in things 
 which set me up for a bad time when it comes to this dude 
 in 10th grade year 11 i think is equivalent i tried for a $ 10,000 dollar scholarship that came with a brand new laptop 
 i got teachers staff and <unk> to be my references wrote an essay and sent everything in 
 three days before the deadline i get a phone call from the company offering the scholarship 
 one of my references has n't sent in their letter 
 let 's have a show of hands of the times a company offering a scholarship calls someone to make sure they get their stuff in 
 i get on the phone to the one guy i know messed up and sure enough he forgot to mail it out 
 wait patiently for the results to be announced and when they do i 'm not one of the <unk> 
 i did n't even win 1 of the 4 minor scholarships that were for my school 
 the 4 kids who did win all of them very smart people were called out of class by counselor scumbag specifically because he wanted them to apply for the scholarship 
 to put this in perspective there 5 students in my grade that everyone agreed were the smart kids '' 
 i was one of them and i did n't get an invite 
 i shrugged the loss off 
 i really just wanted the laptop anyway 
 fast forward half a year 
 i 'm taking a foreign <unk> to the homecoming 
 the girl 's host family was one of my reference a nice teacher who works with the juvenile <unk> and is the adviser of the honor society i worked with him in honor society 
 the girl needs a few more minutes to finish getting ready so i sit in the living room with the teacher and shoot the bull about school 
 he <unk> the conversation towards this scholarship i missed out on 
 i say that that was just tough luck 
 he gives me a confused look and says so you do n't know what happened '' 
 i ask him to elaborate and he tells me a tale 
 about a week after the deadline for the scholarship ended he receives a phone call from the scholarship company 
 the lady on the phone was very confused as to how the teacher could have written such a nice reference letter for a troubled and dangerous student like me 
 the teacher says that i am one of the best students he 's ever worked with a bit sappy but his words not mine 
 he then asks how the lady came to think i was such a terrible person 
 & lt cue <unk> music & gt this lady had called the school to ask about the 5 applicants to the scholarship from our school 
 the first person who she talked to was counselor scumbag 
 he said 4 of the applicants were star students and never got in trouble 
 he claimed the last one me was a <unk> and a terrible student 
 he had on several occasions had to speak to me about my actions in class 
 i would be a terrible candidate for the scholarship due to my aggressive and dangerous behavior 
 now i 'm a little bias but i had only spoken to this counselor a handful of times 
 mostly it was hello counselor '' 
 i 'm not trying to make this <unk> or more revenge worthy 
 i just never spoke to this guy when it was n't absolutely necessary 
 this counselor a person who was suppose to be there to help students just straight up character <unk> me so that i had no chance to win the scholarship 
 after the dance which was lovely and the foreign student thoroughly enjoyed i began to think about this information 
 this counselor did n't like me and obviously would offer no help when i started to look at <unk> 
 i 'd have to do it myself and this revelation gave me an idea 
 the counselor was notorious about scholarship amounts 
 he love to brag about how much a class was offered in scholarships 
 he even had a ceremony at the end of the school year to announce the cumulative amount a student got and where they had accepted to attend college 
 he even let the top <unk> say a few words in thanks for those who helped them 
 i resolved then and there that that would be the hour of my revenge 
 i would earn more scholarships that anyone else in my class forcing the counselor to let me speak in front of my class and the faculty 
 i would blast this scumbag for the jerk move he pulled and let everyone know i got those scholarships by myself and with no help of our <unk> counselor 
 **part 2 - am i suppose to be impressed '' ** now that i had decided to get revenge from this counselor i needed to get to work on getting the scholarships 
 since i pulled a 31 on my act i was able to apply to schools early and <unk> the stupid <unk> process that many universities have 
 i worked to improve my resume as best i could 
 my grades were around a <unk> gpa because i was n't interested in school so i drove home the <unk> activities 
 i got more involved in sports joined the <unk> bowl <unk> bowl team ran for student government and did both <unk> and behind the scenes theatre 
 i never got <unk> to student government but my teachers always nominated me for class <unk> it gave me the unique opportunity to study my prey up close 
 counselor scumbag had a system 
 if you were a family friend or lived in his neighborhood you got preferential treatment 
 not <unk> so if you did n't look for it but it was in everything he did 
 so-and-so got a scholarship that was n't <unk> throughout the school despite 50 % of the school being eligible 
 awards were given to certain people despite being on equal or lesser footing than other students 
 this is how i found out the reason only 5 people applied for the scholarship when i was in 10th grade 
 it was never publicly announced in the school 
 i did n't notice since my family found the scholarship online 
 small things like this should not have happened 
 this counselor claimed that he would help everyone get into college if they would come to him but he kept the best scholarships and opportunities away from the majority of the school 
 by the end of my junior year i had applied to 10 universities around the us 
 in the next 4 months i had another 6 applications sent out 
 by the time school was starting up for my senior year i was <unk> down on schools that i wanted to apply to 
 i thought it would be a good time to move ahead with my plan 
 i walked into counselor scumbag 's office one day and asked him if there were any scholarships he knew of that i could apply for 
 he had spoken with a friend of mine one of the other 4 people who were dubbed the smart kids '' 
 scumbag gave this guy a stack of applications to fill out about 3 inches thick 
 every major university for 300 miles was covered as well as many private scholarships from companies 
 what does scumbag give me 
 2 scholarships neither of which i could ever qualify for 
 thanks to <unk> i was neither female nor hispanic 
 i thanked him anyway and said i would apply to both 
 over the next 6 months i received letters of acceptance from 14 of the 16 schools never heard back from the other 2 
 in total i had be offered $ 516,000 over 4 years with $ <unk> from a single school 
 some may say i 'm <unk> that i have nothing to complain about 
 they maybe right or the 6 years spent working construction with my dad may have put the fear of hard labor in me 
 either way i had done it 
 that amount <unk> any single student 's cumulative scholarships by about $ <unk> 
 i was pretty proud and then i get a note from the office asking to meet with counselor scumbag 
 i had written up a word document that listed all 14 scholarships with amounts and schools and brought it to school that day to show some teachers that i used as references 
 i chuckled to myself as the <unk> had decided to shine on me that afternoon 
 when i got down to his office i asked what he needed 
 scumbag said he had two things for me 
 first was that he needed a list of all scholarships i had been offered for his presentation at the end of the year 
 second was the wonderful news 
 i had received a $ 1000 a year scholarship to school # 9 on my list 
 he said i should be proud of such an accomplishment 
 i laughed in his face 
 $ 4000 is n't even a piss in the bucket '' 
 i slide the list across his desk to him that is my list 
 $ 516,000 in scholarships offered from 14 different universities including the $ 4000 one '' 
 he looks the sheet a couple of times reading it in <unk> 
 some of those schools were nearly 3000 miles away 
 i 'm not sure if it never occurred to him that students would n't want to go to school within a day 's drive of home 
 he sits back in his chair takes a deep breath in through his nose and says am i suppose to be impressed '' 
 this is where i made my mistake 
 i had played my hand too early but i did n't realize it 
 i told him that i had earned more than anyone ever had at our school and that i was looking forward to his presentation 
 i picked up my bag and walked out feeling like a king 
 scumbag sat at his desk with his fingers pressed together in front of him 
 i was on my way to a perfect revenge 
 oh was i ever so wrong 
 **part 3 - an unexpected <unk> a month had past since my encounter with counselor scumbag 
 word had gotten around that i had earned some serious scholarships but i kept it a secret so to have that big <unk> moment 
 scumbag had not made contact with me and i was fine with that 
 i was winning 
 i had done what others had thought <unk> 
 earning over a half a million dollars in scholarships was nothing to <unk> at 
 with the ceremony a week away i was assured of my victory and absolute revenge 
 let this be a lesson for everyone 
 never trust the system to play fair 
 the first sign of danger was that with only a week left no one had been notified about speaking at the ceremony 
 i kept checking with the smart kids '' to see if they had been approached but nothing 
 then the hammer fell 
 the ceremony would be changed this year 
 in an effort to save time we will not be having the students speak at the ceremony since they already do this at graduation 
 we will still present the letters of acceptance to students who were accepted to a local university '' 
 that was all the announcement said 
 i can still remember it now because it caused such a pit to fall in my stomach 
 i had the slimy bastard and he changed the rules 
 in 15 years of him being head counselor the top earning students had spoken at the ceremony 
 and time 
 the ceremony was never longer than an hour so what were they <unk> it for 
 something had to be up 
 i swung by the front office to talk to the secretary 
 i had been an office aide for her in the past it helped to figure out scumbag 's system and she knew most of the gossip around the school 
 this time she too was clueless and could n't figure out why a man so set in his ways would suddenly change the ceremony just a week before it occurred 
 as i walked back to class i saw him out of the corner of my eye 
 he had just finished speaking with another counselor 
 he <unk> my way did a slight double take and smirked 
 i stopped and <unk> back 
 if there ever was a point in my <unk> career that i wanted to punch a faculty member that was it 
 this man had used this ceremony for his purposes for years 
 i had seen him read off scholarships <unk> to $ <unk> to one student and $ <unk> to the next 
 this was n't about making sure people 's feelings were n't hurt 
 he did n't care that a student had put his time and effort into gaining more than anyone thought he could 
 this man wanted nothing more than to control his system 
 i had to force myself to walk away 
 if any of you think i 'm being harsh or bias it 's possible 
 these are the events seen through my eyes but a little bit down i 'll explain more so hold on the day of the ceremony arrives 
 my family goes and gets good seats near the aisle 
 happy faces are all around me but i ca n't help but feel a little <unk> 
 this was to be the stage of my grand revenge 
 i sighed and thought that he would at least have to announce my scholarship of $ <unk> to a university halfway across the country 
 counselor scumbag gets up and begins with his usual <unk> about how wonderful the class was through the years 
 he subtly hints that he had a hand in guiding these brilliant <unk> '' towards a brighter tomorrow 
 the usual sappy sludge <unk> out at events like these 
 scumbag begins to give out the awards 
 first to the students going to the local universities then moves on the the students who have earned their nursing <unk> through the <unk> club health organizations student <unk> or something like that and finally he gets down to me 
 arcval has accepted a scholarship to awesome university '' 
 ... ... ... if you waiting for more that 's it 
 after putting in hundreds of hours or applying writing getting references and visiting campuses i get arcval has accepted a scholarship to awesome university '' 
 i ca n't say anything my family is shocked that he did n't say the amount of the scholarship and that he said it almost in a <unk> whisper 
 i just bite my lower lip and stare dead ahead 
 defeated humiliated and ashamed 
 not much more he can do to me now 
 you ca n't tell but i honestly had to stop writing for a minute 
 i still get upset just thinking about it 
 the only thought that came to my mind was to confront him after the ceremony was done 
 i had to know why he changed everything just because i beat his system 
 so i did 
 i waited for the crowd of thankful students and parents to <unk> 
 when it was just him and me on the stage i asked why '' 
 he looked at me and said because you do n't deserve it '' 
 i look at him for a second and say well it 's a good thing you do n't get to decide everything then is it '' 
 in that one sentence he had brought back a memory that i had of my freshman year 
 my sister was the student body president and she wanted to have a celebration at lunch for the end of a term 
 most everyone was on board with the idea but counselor scumbag would n't aid it he was one of the <unk> to the student government and had to give his permission before any funds could be spent 
 when asked why he said you do n't deserve it '' 
 my sister being a <unk> gave him some choice words to think about and went to the principle and got the celebration approved 
 that was what i had been missing 
 i wanted to prove the system wrong when i should have ignored the system 
 the principal was like a really good father 
 he 'd eat in the cafeteria with students and even join in the basketball games at lunch however you knew he would come down on you if you broke the rules 
 i went to his office the next day and laid out my story just as i have done for you 
 he gave me many of the arguments i alluded in my side notes 
 after asking him to just confront the counselor about it he said arcval i care about you but this is n't enough to go off of '' 
 i stood up turned to walk out and said over my shoulder if you cared about me as much as you said you do you would do something about this '' 
 i walked out and went to first period 30 minutes late 
 now i ca n't vouch for this part 
 i only got this through <unk> and the secondhand telling by the principal 's daughter but here goes 
 the principal thinks about what i told him for a bit 
 i had been in his office a few times but never for anything bad 
 true there were measures in place for bad students before they got to the principal 's office 
 however no bad kid had volunteered to be the mascot for the homecoming parade 
 no bad kid had broken up a fight between sophomore girls 
 no bad kid would have earned $ <unk> in scholarships 
 something was wrong 
 what i wouldnt give to be a fly on the wall in counselor scumbag 's office for those 20 minutes 
 the words were never told to me but it was a verbal beat down that should have been remembered 
 the principal walked in and wanted to know why a kid who had earned 1/3rd of the entire class 's scholarships money wise had n't been recognized as he should have 
 after much <unk> and confronting the truth came out 
 scumbag did n't think i should get the recognition 
 the principal told scumbag that if he tried anything like this again he would have him removed from office union contract said you could n't fire him but you could put him on administrative leave 
 the things you learn at the water cooler ... 
 a few days later after this has been <unk> around the school a few times the principal stops me in the hallway and says everything is taken care of 
 i thank him and hurry off to class thinking that is the end of it 
 classes finally end and graduation night rolls around 
 we 're lucky enough that the weather cleared up and we get to walk on our football field 
 the principal gets up to give his sappy congratulations to the class despite a few <unk> a joke about his daughter being one of them to <unk> it up a bit 
 he then <unk> our class on being the 2nd highest earning class when it came to scholarships 
 over 1.5 million dollars were offered 
 then he says this 1.5 million is a <unk> feat 
 however there is a greater one 
 the measure of a student is how far they are willing to go when faced with <unk> 
 while some <unk> in the world push these students down this class pushed back and none <unk> this determination better than arcval 
 his efforts alone have earned him $ 516,000 in scholarships 
 a feat he did by himself without aid 
 let 's give him a cheer for his intelligence and determination '' 
 not sure if it was tears or a bit of cotton in the air but my eyes were <unk> at that point 
 it was n't what i expected and i 'm sure it 's not what you the reader wanted 
 i would have loved to have the knee jerking gotcha '' moment with that counselor but i did n't get it 
 instead i got the recognition for hard work and determination 
 if it 's any <unk> my little sister was a freshman at this time 
 the next year that counselor offered here a chance to attend a leadership <unk> in our state <unk> 
 he also started posting every scholarship available on a board for everyone to look at 
 the principal looks in on him from time to time to keep him honest but i think he has wised up to the fact that he should help everyone not just his chosen few 
 and that 's it 
 that 's my tale of grand revenge 
 i planned out a huge revenge party just to slip up near the end and ruin it 
 take from this what you will but i got something better than revenge 
 closure 
 closure and the knowledge that my efforts may have helped someone down the road get a better scholarship 
 thanks for reading and sorry about the 3 parts <unk> driving down my parents back lane to pick up my two daughters 20 feet from my parents driveway a truck is sitting with its flashers on sitting in the middle of the back lane blocking the whole road 
 i sit for a bit waiting for her to move and the lady yells at me i have my flashers on i 'm going to be 10 minutes go around the block '' 
 i would have had to pull a <unk> in a back lane drive 500 feet take two left turns drive 600 feet two more left turn 100 more feet to get into the parking spot that was now 20 feet away from me 
 the two ladies in the truck were unloading groceries from the back of the truck at a very cumbersome pace 
 so i respond can you pull ahead 20 feet or pull into the empty driveway yes they had a spot they could have pulled in too to let me pass '' 
 to which she responds no my flashers are on i have 10 minutes to unload '' 
 so i was having none of this nonsense so i turn my car off put my flashers on go to my parents get my moms keys reverse her car into the back lane and put her flashers on 
 i now have my vehicle and my moms vehicle blocking them in 
 they are finishing their unloading of groceries and start to go off on me saying they will call a tow truck and so on and several other verbal abuses to which i respond my flashers are on i 'll only be 10 minutes '' 
 i moved the car 5 minutes later the people in question were not amused 
 tldr - block me from going where i want ill block you in and make you <unk> this is too petty i apologize and will go post over in petty 
 i saw a story that reminded me of this incident in this thread though so i figured it might be ok. also on mobile and wall of text so again sorry 
 during winter of my 9th year alive my parents had purchased their first convertible 
 i remember my dad rolling into the driveway at <unk> with the top down enjoying the florida chill 
 my older brother 11 at the time and i were so excited and begged to ride in it right then as we believed tomorrow was too far away 
 my parents agreed but said to go get dressed in warm clothing 
 we change come out and they tuck a comforter around us after we had <unk> in 
 they took us a town over to a <unk> where we all got hot chocolate to enjoy the ride home with to make the convertible just a little more enjoyable 
 we come to a <unk> and although the top is down all the windows are up to reduce wind flow 
 that 's when it happened 
 two eggs smacked the windows one on the edge of the smaller back window causing it to get on my brother a little 
 the two teenagers yelled out some insults and peeled off going right 
 now my father was not yet even 30 and a marine who had a short fuse 
 he immediately pulled out of our lane and took the same right determined to get the punks i know not the <unk> with children in the car 
 we followed them before they lost us in an apartment complex parking lot 
 after a couple minutes father gives up and goes to exit said complex 
 while sitting at the stop sign another car pulls up at the exit no more than 3 yards away 
 it was none other than dickbag 1 & amp 2. my older brother sees them before any of us 
 he immediately <unk> his seat belt stood up and threw his hot chocolate in such a perfect throw i do n't think i 'll ever see anything so beautiful again 
 this hot <unk> <unk> <unk> right into the drivers window and exploded upon impact 
 the <unk> immediately jumped out and <unk> about it being hot and it being everywhere 
 just as quickly as he had stood up older brother sat back down and <unk> up 
 stares of disbelief all around father starts driving home with a faint smile on his face 
 i shared my hot chocolate happily 
 tl dr : my older brother served revenge with a side of hot chocolate i did n't know where to post this but this seemed more pro than petty 
 this revenge was carried out by a friend of mine 
 we connected the stories months later and we could n't believe it 
 it still <unk> my fancy to this day so my so and i are at our local strip mall doing some shopping 
 this shopping plaza has a movie theater in it as well 
 as we were walking into the parking lot this brand new silver scion xb with dealer plates still whips into the parking lot 
 all four windows of the scion go down and a 16 year old pops out of each one 
 they each were armed with squirt guns and water balloons 
 first target 90 year old woman 
 <unk> right on her <unk> 
 she is soaked to the bone 
 they spray anyone within distance of the car before <unk> a few more balloons into the distance 
 the tires <unk> and they were on the open road again 
 the whole ordeal took less than 45 seconds 
 the family of the old woman helps her to a bench everyone else is fine but pissed and wet 
 we got in our car and took off 
 months later my friends are out at that same movie theater seeing some movie 
 right as the credits roll 4 kids stand up in the front row with water guns and just start blasting the audience 
 they laugh and run off out the main entrance 
 my friend was in the second row and was <unk> very pissed and wet 
 she grabbed her purse and ran out the emergency exit 
 right when she gets to the front to the theater she sees these kids run out and jump in a brand new silver scion xb with dealer plates 
 my friend is smart 
 she always brings a big bottle of soda to the movie theater 
 so she pulled out this almost full bottle of soda ran up to the window of this scion and just <unk> these guys with <unk> coke 
 the whole bottle emptied inside that pretty new car 
 she said she just threw the empty bottle on the drivers lap and said have a good night guys '' my fancy is so <unk> right now 
 my mother was from a rough family she was the youngest of 5. she was very volatile mean & amp narcissistic which meant she did n't have many friends 
 similarly she was <unk> & amp got very jealous 
 she met my dad when she was a teenager and married him in her 20s 
 my dad is a lovely man i 'd say he 's the opposite to my mother & amp i guess they hit it off 
 my mum did n't really want kids and they had n't discussed it 
 the game plan changed when my dad decided he wanted a kid 
 they made a baby & amp i popped out yay 
 my dad stayed at home to look after me and quit his job 
 my mum decided to go back to work 
 this made my dad and i really close as he looked after me mainly for the first few years of my life 
 at this point i loved both of my parents and felt loved 
 when i started school i was bullied for my looks and intelligence many people thought me to be an idiot but after testing it turns out that i 'm <unk> like my dad 
 my parents paid a small portion for me to see a private tutor & amp the <unk> is managed - so much that i do a level english 
 my mother however continued to treat me like an idiot and would make comments to bring me down 
 she had began drinking & amp was put in hospital when i was about <unk> 
 she came out a few months later & amp stopped drinking 
 things were ok as she was stable and we thought things would get better 
 however over the next few years my mother became more volatile mean and she openly told me she was jealous of me 
 she made comments such as i wish i 'd never had you i wish i 'd had a miscarriage '' and no one likes you '' blah blah 
 anyway she was a bitch 
 i put up with it until she started physically beating me i was 12 and my dad & amp then i 'd fight back in self <unk> 
 she would then go to the doctors and tell them that i was beating her up lol and that i needed to be put in care 
 arguments between my parents got worse and my dad wanted to leave her 
 he realised how bad she was one night when she attacked him & amp called the police - the police took her away 
 she blamed this behaviour on drinking yes she 's started again 
 however when she was sober she 'd try to hug me and upon realising that i did n't want her near me she 'd get angry again 
 my mum died a few years ago 
 i ca n't say i miss her she was the bane of my life 
 i am not a bad person but she made me feel like i was the worst person ever known to man 
 i understand she had her own struggles but she took them out on the people she was supposed to love the most 
 my revenge is subtle she told me that i 'd miss her when she was gone but i do n't miss her 
 i do n't go to her grave think of her on her birthday i do n't feel anything towards her but pity and disgust 
 it 's sad but i have my dad a loving step mum & amp understanding friends 
 i have many good memory 's of my childhood and i 'm now a very happy person 
 ah revenge is <unk> ago either before i was born or shortly thereafter i 'm 20 some dumb jackass had the bright idea to tailgate my father like it will somehow make him go faster 
 in winter with snow and ice everywhere 
 now as i 'm sure we all know the worst possible thing you can do with that kind of shitty road condition is to slam on your brakes 
 my father being the clever man that he is pressed his brake pedal enough to light up the brake lights but not <unk> the brakes 
 dumb jackass <unk> <unk> on his brakes and proceeds to spin out into the ditch 
 my father felt no obligation to go back and <unk> dr at the bottom of the page 
 this is also a <unk> name as i do n't care for it to be associated with my regular forum posting 
 i ca n't tell if i 'm a bad person or not ... i <unk> it over but i may be blinded by my own sense of justice 
 because i am the <unk> woman 
 whatever 
 i was 19 living in phoenix and working at a restaurant while going to college 
 one of my managers offered to come over and assist in a school project i was stuck on 
 i lived alone and was a bit naive but still allowed him in when he came over much later and had been drinking with other co-workers 
 without lots of details he drugged and sexually assaulted me 
 the next day he lied about it at work but he then phoned the restaurant repeatedly while he was out of town and not only admitted to it but <unk> in the fact that i was good '' and it 's a pity i did n't remember 
 oh yeah he was also in his early thirties married and had a child 
 i did n't phone the police because i was 19 scared and remembered bits and pieces 
 i understand how women can be treated in rape cases and i chose to not pursue it 
 i quit that job and moved about six months later after becoming ill in what i can only assume is some kind of ptsd / nervous break down 
 here 's the revenge part : i found him on facebook 
 he still lives in phoenix 
 i found his wife 's facebook 
 i found his address 
 i created a fake profile and wrote his wife who was pictured with daddy '' and three children and told her every bit that happened 
 it was nothing graphic as i was sincerely not trying to hurt her but there was definitely enough detail that she would know it 's true 
 i 've never heard back from her but i know she has seen it 
 she has since moved to another city in phoenix from what i can see 
 tl dr -- asshole drugs and <unk> me so i find his wife years later and tell her what he did shortly after the birth of their child 
 <unk> : i really really appreciate the feedback from everyone even that which i may disagree with 
 obviously rape is a very <unk> subject for many people and can be quite <unk> 
 thank you all for the kind words and support 
 even though this is an anonymous internet forum it really does mean a lot to me personally 
 my greatest thanks again 
 & lt <unk> 
 so i am a bouncer 
 proof : check the username 
 i 've had some stories on prorevenge before but each night i work is a new adventure and i got another good one the other weekend 
 so i switched my allegiance from the bar i worked at to the new bar that opened up in town because they offered me more money for my services 
 so i have been working there for quite a while 
 usually everything is pretty chill and i get to walk around be big hit on girls and drink a free beer every hour or so 
 good stuff 
 well i live in a college town 
 and being in a college town there are <unk> that are always at war with each other 
 i have no problem with <unk> i was in one myself 
 and i do n't care which one you 're in 
 if you 're nice to me i 'll be nice to you 
 well apparently my opinion was n't too popular among these guys 
 well every weekend there 's this one douchebag fraternity i 'll call them the snakes who comes into the bar and tries to start fights with every single butt fucking person who looks at them the wrong way 
 and they have one <unk> who we 'll nickname dick 
 when i 'm working the door i do n't let them in 
 but i work the floor a lot too 
 well the snakes are the pretty boy pussies who have to gang up on someone <unk> to win a fight 
 and they still usually lose because they 're such bitches 
 i actually punched one of these guys at a football game but that 's a different story 
 well the snakes roll up in the bar 15 deep drunk as shit and looking to show their dicks 
 there 's another fraternity who is really cool so we 'll call them the dogs 
 well apparently one of the dogs is dancing with a girl that dick is interested in 
 so the snakes see this and try to start some shit 
 they start pushing and eventually punches get thrown 
 well i get in there and break the shit up and throw a few of the snakes out including dick 
 he 's cussing me out the entire time and says he 'll whoop my ass and get his boys to whoop my ass and yada yada yada 
 so after i throw them out i go back inside 
 there 's some tension but nothing happens for the rest of the night 
 or so i thought 
 after we close down the bar and start cleaning up i go outside to the front door to drink a beer and relax for a few minutes 
 well i walk outside and it was like fucking <unk> <unk> the <unk> 
 the snakes called their entire fraternity to come jump the dogs 
 there were about 40 or fifty snakes and about 15 dogs 
 since the parking lot is out of my jurisdiction and i 'm not about to get stabbed over some stupid shit i call the police and do n't do a damn thing but watch 
 so the inevitable happens and there 's a huge <unk> going on in the parking lot 
 the dogs are beating the shit out of the snakes 
 there 's this one dog who is fucking huge 
 i 'm a bouncer and i 'm saying this dude was fucking huge 
 i watch him uppercut this motherfucker clean off of his feet then turn around and <unk> another pussy snake 
 it was awesome 
 well this big mother fucker gets his eye sight on dick and charges at him 
 dick tries to get away but alas his drunk <unk> 'd feet are not quick enough 
 <unk> the giant grabs dick punches him square in the jaw and then picks him up over his head 
 he walks over to the dumpster and throws dick right in 
 i 'm in awe at how awesome that was 
 well shortly after the police show up break up the fight and arrest a few people 
 i go back inside to clean up 
 after about an hour it 's my job to take out the trash 
 so i walk outside with this ripe bag of bar juice and vomit to the dumpster 
 i look inside and look who is still in the dumpster 
 dick too fucked up to get out 
 i said hey mother fucker you 're not gon na die are you '' 
 he just kind of looks at me with his swollen jaw and drunk eyes and just moans what i took as a no 
 i said good '' and dumped all the alcohol vomit spit <unk> and other <unk> of the bar all over him 
 i said i 'll just leave you here with all the other trash '' and i went home 
 it felt fantastic seeing that mother fucker who constantly started fights and made my job harder get his ass handed to him 
 i guess he never learned his lesson though because dick still comes into the bar and tries to start fights 
 but deep down i think he knows that he 'll always be a piece of trash 
 tl dr. i 'm a bouncer 
 there was a fraternity beef going on in my bar 
 ring leader of douchebag fraternity gets ass whooped and thrown into a dumpster 
 i make sure he 's not dead and dump disgusting bar trash all over him 
 also titties 
 the backstory : this story is a few years old now im about to graduate from college as a <unk> senior and this story starts between junior and senior year of high school 
 i 'm not sure you know the saying never stick your dick in crazy '' well in high school i did not realize the seriousness of that advice 
 my ex lets call her b was best friends with the girl next door 
 when i first met her she seemed like kind sweet and caring individual 
 we met that first night and immediately hit it off texting back and fourth every waking moment after that point until i asked her out two weeks later 
 her family was pretty strict but it was understandable i was a senior guy on the football and track team with a sports car and a fairly cocky attitude 
 i was also an eagle scout and all around good guy so i managed to get in her family 's good graces fairly quickly 
 things seemed good for a while until we got past the phase of absolute good behavior no matter what 
 thats when things started to go downhill 
 she revealed to me that she had been a cutter '' in the past but that it was no longer an issue 
 this it turned out was a lie 
 as time went on she started to ease me into the idea that she liked self harm and that i was the thing that kept her afloat every day 
 as a 17 year old in his first real relationship i figured that i was a pretty awesome guy and i might be able to salvage what was otherwise a bad situation so i stuck with it thinking that things would get better 
 throughout my senior year it became clear that she was n't <unk> into self harm it was still in full swing and me being the loving boyfriend i was tried to help her through it 
 around march i had finally had it and tried to break up for the first time 
 she told me that if i did this i would be signing her death warrant as she would become suicidal 
 looking back this was the point that i should have called to cops 
 i stupidly stuck around after this trying to bring her mental health up 
 it was n't like i did n't like her it was just that she stressed me out with her <unk> bullshit 
 after the breakup attempt though things changed she knew she had kept me on the hook out of sheer crazy <unk> so she was always trying to gain the upper hand and any time i was holding my own it became my fault that she was cutting herself remember i was a 17 year old kid naive to the world and really just trying to be sweet and loving 
 it was around this time that she started gas lighting me and trying to turn me against anyone that was a friend or family to me that would say she was being crazy 
 if she fucked up it was suddenly my fault and the relationship immediately became much less fun 
 i am not proud to say that i put up with this bullshit for another year and a half it went on entirely too long and i will admit i fell for her brainwashing losing contact with nearly all my friends and my dad 's side of the family 
 eventually i could n't take it and left town to go to a different college further north in the state 
 after a few weeks in a new town hanging out with my old friends and realizing that i was a pretty awesome dude in my own right i ended it <unk> off her brainwashing petty bullshit once and for all 
 i immediately was getting 24/7 texts i miss you '' i love you '' forever and always '' which started to quickly turn to come back '' i 'm sad '' and finally <unk> out around i <unk> your <unk> into my leg '' and i took a bottle of pills '' 
 let me put this straight i didnt and dont want her dead i just wanted to be free from that environment 
 and i still cared for some reason just not enough to stay 
 so i called when she told me she took a bottle of pills 
 and when she didnt answer i called back maybe 5 more times over the course of the next hour trying to get in touch with her or her friends to see if she was ok. fast forward to the next day i get a call from the local sheriff from my hometown m i just got out of a conversation with b and she wants to file a harassment complaint against your calls yesterday '' so i explained the details to officer friendly that she was nuts and that it was not normal behavior on my part for that to happen 
 he replied with thats fine she struck me as not normal and i tend to think given knowing you i 'm from a small town i 've met him before even been to <unk> with mutual friends that this isnt normal 
 anyway <unk> been asked to not contact her again '' i replied that that was fine i broke up with her trying to get away 
 so that was it i did n't talk to her again 
 the revenge : so at this point i had been away for another year and a half or so in my time in the university i rushed a fraternity and had dated a few times leaving b well into my past as a distant unpleasant memory 
 one day i got a text from her out of nowhere 
 hey its b i just got a new job and im dancing at <unk> lounge tonight you should come '' 
 i looked up what this lounge she was dancing at was and it turns out that its a strip club and a pretty <unk> and low budget one at that 
 i confronted one of my friends and pledge brothers in my fraternity f about the situation and what we should do about it and together we concocted a plan 
 f saw me when i was with b and saw the bitchy shit she pulled and then heard about her call to the sheriff 
 we got as many brothers together as we could and gave them a <unk> session about what was up m 's ex b is working at the lounge tonight 
 here are pictures of her and what her <unk> will be again she sent me photos trying to <unk> me there 
 whatever you do do not get any dances from her or tip her when she 's working the pole '' 
 as word spread we got around 60 guys in the house of 80 to <unk> to the lounge and fill that place more that it had been in years and throughout the night not a single one of my brothers gave b a cent instead getting lap dances and going to the pole whenever she wasnt there 
 if she was in a place trying to gain customers we would empty that area 
 over the course of the night i would bet we spent somewhere between 2-3 grand and as best i could tell not a single cent spent on b the whole night 
 the next day i got a text from b saying what the shit was that 
 it was my first night and on the most <unk> night that place has had in years nobody tipped me 
 the boss just fired me because of not making any cash '' 
 so i told her you said i ca n't contact you again or you 'd file harassment charges 
 i just did what you asked and never contacted you again 
 i then told my bro f i think i just won '' 
 tl dr in the end i managed to get out of an abusive as fuck relationship get closer with 60 of my frat bros get my ex fired from a 3rd rate strip club and win the break up 
 <unk> for formatting and some basic changes 
 edit # 2 : shout out to <unk> for the gold 
 first time <unk> so thank you so 2 weeks ago it was the end of my school term 
 i was so glad that the summer was almost here 
 not because i got to do nothing for 6 weeks and not because school was out 
 the reason i was so glad was because i could now get away from a girl 
 a girl i shall name sophie 
 ever since the beginning of the school term this girl has been sexually harassing me 
 now you might be saying that 's a bit extreme 
 i doubt she 's been doing anything to bad 
 well ... at the beginning of the term it was n't to bad 
 sophie started coming up to me to stroke my face i ignored it and thought nothing of it 
 a few weeks later she 's grabbing my balls in class 
 i had to tell someone so i told my parents 
 they thought it was n't as bad as i was saying it was so they did nothing about it 
 i went to my friends for help they all had the same response tell the head of house 
 telling the head of house would only make things worse 
 she would act all innocent and say she did n't do it 
 but i went there anyway 
 i thought i needed someone to talk to about it 
 i 've never been very confident myself but this man has always helped me through times like this 
 i 'll call him sir 
 sir realizes that i do n't want him to get involved 
 he tells me that the only way i can deal with this is by myself 
 and you know what 
 at the moment it all came back to me 
 all the times she <unk> places below the <unk> the times where the teacher is completely oblivious and then her friends start laughing at me 
 i say nothing and i leave the room 
 that night i research everything about her 
 i find her facebook filled with <unk> of herself in the mirror wearing <unk> clothing 
 i do n't have facebook myself so i guess she thought i would never find her on the internet 
 sophie has all these posts on her page about the boys she has been touching 
 it 's not just me 
 this girl has been <unk> boys balls since day 1. she does n't have any of her school friends on facebook so i guess she thinks she can post whatever the fuck she wants and no one will find her 
 i take <unk> print them out and put them in my bag 
 i was ready 
 in comes the last day of term 
 i go to my first lesson 
 and she 's sat in the seat next to me the teacher is making no attempt to move her so i sit down 
 the kids behind me are putting me down 
 i completely block them out of my head and focus on sophie 
 we start doing whatever and then sophie starts <unk> the back of my head 
 i look at her 
 she has the biggest shit-eating grin i have ever seen in my life 
 i turn to her and say ok what is your problem '' 
 she looks to the people sat behind her and acts all innocent 
 she says it 's just a joke 
 i reply by saying oh was touching my balls a joke then '' 
 the class goes silent 
 everyone is looking at me and sophie 
 i open my bag and get the print screens out 
 was touching -- -- - a joke too '' 
 as i slam down the paper 
 and -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- etc '' as i 'm saying their names i 'm slamming down the print screens 
 a shocked look is on her face 
 she tries to get her friends to back her up that it was only a joke 
 they burst out at her and said oh my god we do n't even like you 
 she soon realizes that all the people that were her friends did n't even want to be her friends 
 she is now unsure of what to do 
 she is looking round for support but she get 's none 
 she turns to a kid who i shall call john and asks him for support 
 john goes up to her and says do you know why i took those pictures 
 just so you could leave me the fuck alone '' 
 the class at this point is in a riot 
 it 's like a fight has broken out 
 it turns out john had been taking naked pictures of me when i was in <unk> sophie is crying the whole class is telling her that 's just wrong 
 you ca n't touch someone there 
 etc 
 the teacher is trying to break me and sophie up and then ... i leave 
 that was 2 weeks ago 
 and i have no idea what to expect when i get back to school 
 tl dr : girl <unk> my balls in lesson turns out she has been doing it for ages to other people call her out in lesson turns out she has no <unk> friend was stationed in korea at the time on a 3 yr tour he had <unk> his wife is korean when a new warrant officer came in approx 6 months after his arrival 
 my friend never really cared for this officer however he dealt with it 
 it was a known fact within the office that this officer was married with a family back in the states 
 well shortly after arriving in korea the warrant officer met a young 20 yr old korean girl who he began dating 
 they dated quite a bit and everyone kind of turned a blind eye 
 this is actually illegal in the military 
 before i say anything please note i married a lovely korean woman and i am very happy with her and think korean people are great 
 with this being said because of how korean society treats <unk> young korean people generally lack the relationship <unk> when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex 
 as an american dating at 14-15 yrs old is not uncommon 
 my first <unk> was at 13 i do n't think that unusual 
 my wife 's first <unk> was at 21 and most of her friends are right around that age group 
 many korean girls that i know first <unk> came in around the age of <unk> yrs old 
 which means this girls first boyfriend was this officer 
 she did n't have the relationship <unk> to see everything 
 not saying korean people are immature however i just thought that point needs to be clarified 
 in fact they are very hard working 
 well it really surprised everyone especially my friend when this officer proposed to this girl 
 my friend got extremely worried at this point what was this guy doing 
 was he really this stupid 
 well he still turned a blind eye it was time for the officer to go back home 
 by this time the girl had moved all of her stuff to the officers home 
 the officer had all of her belongings packed up and sent back to america 
 the officer brought the girl to the airport to get on the flight 
 this girl went out and got her passport told her parents she moving to america and dropped everything in her life for this guy 
 who she did n't even know he was married 
 well they get to the airport and its her first time at the airport 
 they walk around grab a coffee etc when he tells her he has to go to the bathroom 
 he grabs his bag and off to the bathroom 
 she waited for him she waited for him for approx 30 mins before she decided to start looking for him 
 she spent a good 45 minutes checking for him asking around if anyone had seen him 
 she got airport security involved about 2 hrs later but they were n't much help 
 she was in tears she of course thought the worst something terrible had happened to the love of her life 
 she called my friend in tears my friend was obviously confused 
 the flight had been scheduled to leave 2 hrs ago what happened 
 he handed the phone to his wife so she could speak korean and he saw his <unk> face go from a face of concern to confusion and then he knew ... her face became angry 
 no angry is a nice way of saying this she fucking pissed off at this scumbag 
 i 'm sure at this point she 'd like nothing better to cut his balls off 
 his wife explained everything to my friend 
 the officer had abandoned his <unk> wife at the airport 
 not only did he ditch this girl in the airport with the <unk> of living with him forever he also took all of her stuff to america 
 my friend rushed off to the airport a lengthy drive approx 3 hrs to collect her on the way he took the time to make a few phone calls 
 he had one of his soldiers even pull the officers home phone number 
 lets just say my friend had a very interesting conversation with the following individuals 1. commander of the officers former unit 2. commander of the officers next unit 3. his wife i 'll let you assume how those conversations went suffice to say that officer was discharged from the military and received a court martial 
 here is what i know what happened for a fact 1. he got divorced <unk> support 2. he got kicked out of the military he lost his retirement this was worth millions of dollars over the course of a lifetime edit : grammar and cleared up a few <unk> ex and i purchased the house in which he grew up 
 we wanted to add a shut-off valve to the main water line inside the house so we could do some plumbing repairs to multiple items in the house 
 our plumber told us he could not locate the city 's main shut-off valve that 's usually in the front of the house and we would have to pay a <unk> amount of money to freeze the line to get the work done 
 not an option for us especially since the city provides our water and they should be able to turn it off 
 right 
 so i called the city water dept to have them shut off the water from the main city line 
 the plumber told us the city should be able to locate this for us 
 two city workers show up i will call them <unk> and <unk> 
 b and b go out front and spend a few minutes looking for the shut-off valve cover 
 they do n't find it 
 they come to my door and proceed to tell me the news and that it is my responsibility to hire someone to dig up my front yard to locate the <unk> shut-off valve 
 i asked why i should have to do it as i was always under the impression that it was the city 's responsibility to have access to my water shut-off valve 
 i was told in no uncertain terms that women just do n't understand how water systems work and i would have to deal with it on my own '' 
 well i 'm not the smartest person in the world but i understand the basics of how i get water from the city i also know that if the city workers want to shift that responsibility to me i will find a way to put the responsibility back where i truly believe it belongs 
 since the city ca n't shut off my water i guess i can get free water forever so why should i pay for it 
 one year later and i have n't paid a water bill 
 i finally get a call from the city comptroller asking when i plan on paying my water bill 
 i tell him i will gladly pay my water bill as soon as they shut off my water 
 you could hear the <unk> in his voice you want us to shut off your water '' 
 i knew i was about to pay back b and b right then 
 mr. comptroller was very pissed off when i told him all the details of my discussion how b and b refused to find the shut-off and how they insulted me when they made their comment about how women just did n't understand how water stuff works blah blah blah 
 i must say he was very sympathetic and he apologized profusely 
 he promised he would get to the bottom of the problem and would call me back 
 he did not sound too happy with the city water dept 
 the next day i get a call from the comptroller and he tells me that b and b would be at my house whenever i had time to see them and he had stressed to them how important it was to find the main valve 
 i made an appointment and sure enough b and b show up with a <unk> and some shovels and proceed to dig up the easement between the street and sidewalk but they do n't find the shut-off 
 so they get out their <unk> and start to break up two <unk> of sidewalk before they finally find the shut-off valve completely buried under the sidewalk 
 well 
 when they came to the door and told me they found the shut-off all i could do was gloat 
 they were all hot and sweaty and dirty and if they had n't been such jerks i would have offered them a nice <unk> <unk> 
 by their <unk> demeanor i could tell they had been dressed down for their behavior 
 it was a glorious moment 
 within a couple of days the shut-off was moved to the easement the sidewalk was replaced b and b apologized and my plumbing problems got fixed 
 do n't tell me women do n't understand plumbing ... ... i 'm a professor at a state university for the past 17 years and teach <unk> and <unk> students 
 i 've many stories both good and bad but i 've never felt the need to retaliate against a student 
 until one day i met my nemesis 
 this student wanted to go to medical school though they were of very <unk> intellect and came off as socially inept and personally <unk> 
 i and my class stood in her way so i had to be shoved out of the way on her route to being a <unk> 
 she figured the best way to get ahead was to be the <unk> wheel and bitch about everything 
 in <unk> if you complain enough about a class we give you a high grade and send you up to the next poor bastard for you to torment 
 rinse and repeat 
 so nemesis went all out to find everything and anything to complain about : exam had 80 questions on it <unk> said 75 questions : complaint lecture notes were released in a format that was based on <unk> but the student wanted <unk> hell no : complaint missed <unk> questions on quizzes and material was n't covered in lecture readings children 
 i assign them for my health 
 : complaint inappropriate language in lecture <unk> class 
 penis penis penis but always <unk> correct : complaint i did not return her emails the same day she wrote them : complaint everything i did said or thought about : complaint by the end she had escalated these issues all of the way to the top and i got called into the dean 's office 
 my <unk> above me have worked with me for years giving me no fear of a student going over my head '' with a complaint 
 but this student tried 
 dean : <unk> this student has sent more than a dozen complaints to the administration '' 
 me : just a dozen 
 i was betting far far more '' 
 dean : normally we would let this pass as this student is known for doing this and has even involved legal counsel in previous classes 
 but you have somehow <unk> her previous complaint record by a factor of 3 and none of her other instructors this semester have gotten one 
 she has singled you out for complaints and some arguably appear to be about you specifically targeting this student 
 yeah in clinical cases i replaced all of the patients names with her first name even if the patient was a guy 
 but her name was very common and there were three other ones with that name in class 
 so go easy do n't <unk> her 
 just ride it out and be done with it '' 
 me : thanks dean 
 good talk bro '' 
 my nemesis kept it up 
 i gave her a higher grade than she deserved which i believe was the whole point as she needed the grades for med school 
 then i washed my <unk> hands 
 a year later i was assigned to be the committee head of the faculty that create group letters of recommendation for medical school applications 
 and she submitted the form for our committee to create her recommendation packet 
 students can and should waive the right to read these evaluations 
 if you are afraid of what a professor will say about you do n't ask them for a letter 
 my nemesis made sure to point out to the committee in a formal letter that because of problems with all of the professors that would be writing letters she wanted to make sure their letters were appropriate and of the correct tone and content before we sent them off 
 therefore she would review them before approving them for <unk> in her packet 
 nobody wanted to drop the <unk> bomb on her and write a true letter as you know 
 lawyers 
 and she would see all of these letters as would her counsel before we sent them 
 so our hands were tied 
 but one brave souls went around and <unk> her letter <unk> into creating <unk> choruses of praise these would be the letters you would expect to read to the <unk> committee about <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 we are talking true works of art 
 nobody would believe that a student with this background or <unk> score could get one of these <unk> masterpieces let alone a whole panel 
 and i included a note from the committee stating that the student had previously filed academic complaints against each and every professor that wrote her a letter therefore these letters may not reflect her true academic potential 
 we got our <unk> lawyer to check this with a fine tooth comb but our committee had a duty in our committee recommendation letter to inform those reading the professors individual recommendations if there may be a <unk> <unk> or formal action that could influence the veracity and quality of the recommendations '' 
 the student did n't have the right to see that part unless they request it later 
 after the letters have been sent out unfortunately for them 
 so she carpet <unk> the medical schools with primary applications every <unk> do and <unk> school that existed got one 
 the cost must have been <unk> but with parents that can afford lawyers for their brat in undergrad i am sure they <unk> the bill gladly to get her out of the house 
 within her application packet came those beautiful letters and those three explosive paragraphs explaining that this student filed academic complaints against every letter writer and did not waive the right to keep their letters secret 
 it does n't take a genius on the admissions committee of each of these schools to read between the lines on this one and drop that application in the trash before granting an interview 
 she did not get one interview 
 more than 30 applications not one school invited her to continue her application process 
 that gets a <unk> <unk> 
 and for those of you whose lives i may have saved by preventing her from becoming the most <unk> and incompetent doctor imaginable and screwing up treatment to you or your loved ones you are most <unk> welcome 
 had a salesman work for me who was a <unk> enough guy 
 we lived in the same town our families knew one another and we shared a handful of mutual friends 
 i was good to this guy 
 we paid him <unk> we were patient as he tried to build a clientele 
 we allowed <unk> leave when he had a baby and for his older kids needs too 
 turned out he was working for someone else while also working for me 
 he was stealing information and sharing it with them about our business 
 i found this out after having to fire him for lying and <unk> a customers signature and faking a po 
 let him go found out all the other stuff about his other work sharing secrets and found lots of <unk> info on him computer 
 while i was mad i did n't do anything because i did n't want to think about him anymore 
 never spoke of him poorly around town and did n't share gossip 
 so i was surprised to learn he was bad mouthing me 
 spread lies and made up a story about why he quit 
 caused his kid to threaten my kid at school 
 my revenge was subtle ... i posted in the missed connections section of craig 's list a post about him <unk> an anonymous gay sex <unk> he is married at his home 
 since i knew him and his personal details i was able to make a plausible story that after posted ... received lots of responses asking if i was looking for my former employee 
 i said yes to over 50 emails asking for information 
 fast forward 3 weeks later i heard his wife threw him out of the house 
 revenge ... best served cold this is a story about some revenge i <unk> on behalf of my best friend 
 my best friend is an artist 
 she makes her living on her art which is a pretty difficult thing to do 
 she also pays me to handle the <unk> business end of things that she does n't like to deal with 
 so when someone tries to screw her over i have a vested interest in putting a stop to it 
 my friend 's art is fairly popular online which means it gets stolen a lot 
 one of the things i take care of is keeping an eye out for infringement and contacting the people who have stolen from her 
 i try to handle things civilly 
 most of the thieves honestly do n't know better 
 they 're the kind of people who think that because they <unk> it on google images it 's free for anyone to use 
 most of the time they apologize and agree to stop once i explain to them that it is copyright infringement 
 a couple of months ago i came across a guy who had taken one of my friend 's product designs copied it exactly and was now making and selling copies via instagram 
 unlike most of the people i deal with this guy was actually an artist himself 
 he was a college student majoring in social media and <unk> in product design 
 so you 'd think he 'd understand copyright and how to behave on the internet right 
 nope 
 he gave a half-assed apology and promised not to sell the <unk> anymore 
 a few months later i was doing my usual google searches to hunt for art thieves when i came across the same guy 
 he was no longer selling the design but he had added photos of it to his digital resume his linkedin and his profile on <unk> a website where artists and <unk> go to show off and get jobs 
 now this guy has a huge social media presence as you 'd expect from someone with a degree in social media 
 he has an account with every social media website in existence and about fifty i 've never heard of 
 the guy is obviously using social media and networking to land his first big job since he graduated in may 
 and he 's using my friend 's art and claiming it as his own in order to get hired 
 potential employers are going to hire him based on a product design that he stole 
 now at this point i 'm pissed 
 i 've given him a chance to do the right thing 
 he knows that he 's in the wrong here 
 he 's been caught and instead of apologizing and moving on he 's posted my friend 's work all over the internet claiming it as it 's own 
 i can tell from the date on the posts that he uploaded all these images after we talked to him and informed him that he was <unk> on her copyright 
 that 's when i decided to hit him where it hurt 
 right now there is nothing more important to this guy than his name 
 so i wrote up a blog post with the guy 's name and a long documentation of his theft including all the photos 
 the post spread like <unk> and within just a few hours the search results for the guys name lead to my post 
 my post is currently the 8th result when you search the guys name 
 **tl : dr - you steal my friend 's art for your resume i make sure all your potential employers know what kind of person you are 
 ** some back story here : i 'm a handyman on the weekends to get me out of the office and feeling like i 'm actually producing something -- picture a <unk> of office space '' 
 i 've been doing handyman work for about fifteen years on and off and i 'm really good at it 
 so i get a client who lives in chicago and wants me to do some handyman work at some vacation rentals he owns in <unk> all four are neglected and while they look nice they need some real work 
 i agree get a retainer and a service contract signed and get to work 
 i usually do about 3-4 hours of handyman work each weekend but this guy starts giving me work to do in the vicinity of 12 - 18 hours per weekend 
 and not handyman work but errands and assistant work drop off keys put out and take in garbage cans etc 
 this is not what i signed up for but he 's paying me so whatever 
 i figure i 'll get his properties up to par within a few months at this rate and then it will be a simple hour or two a weekend to maintain 
 unfortunately his retainer runs out in about a month so i send of an invoice and a request for more funds i like to keep a little <unk> in case my client tries to not pay me and for the next two weeks i keep getting shitty answers 
 one day he says he wrote the check the next week he says he finally sent it a few days later he says he wired it to my account etc 
 after a month of this i 'm fed up 
 i sent him a final invoice for all the work with the notification that all work will cease until payment and a full retainer are paid as stipulated in the contract 
 a few days go by and i get payment for <unk> than have the <unk> amount as well as an edited invoice 
 he feels he should n't have to pay for a bunch of the stuff because he could do it if he lived here 
 fine 
 i <unk> the invoice noting a bunch of stuff as paid '' and the remainder as unpaid -- will return materials or return to original condition unless payment is made '' 
 all of the items under this heading are small such as door locks cable wires <unk> breakers etc 
 no word back after a week 
 second notice sent 
 no word back 
 final notice sent 
 he finally sends back that he paid what he was going to pay 
 i 'm normally a very nice guy 
 if he had said that he was low on funds and maybe do a trade or help a guy out -- no problem 
 but treat me like what i do is n't valuable and we have a problem 
 sooooo i go buy a $ 5 tube of superglue head up to the house and get to work 
 superglue in the locks of the sliding doors keeping them locked they lead to an amazing <unk> <unk> the beach superglue the front door locks keeping them <unk> 
 superglue the window hardware to lock them closed 
 one or two <unk> on each fan i repaired a few switches kitchen living room bedroom -- leave the hallway and closet lights working a few circuit breakers in the off position and finally the cable for internet 
 i made sure it was only things i had repaired or fixed but after 30 minutes this place was essentially an unlivable <unk> of <unk> hell 
 five dollars well <unk> parents run a tow truck company 
 they often are tasked with towing and <unk> vehicles on behalf of the police most often when drunk drivers are caught and found unfit to drive 
 his business is in a part of the world bc canada where rules against drunk drivers can be absolutely crushing - <unk> can be suspended <unk> can be required 30 day <unk> may be required etc 
 so we get a police job to go pick up a ford escape and impound it for 30 days 
 fees for this type of thing can go as high as $ 1000 depending on where it was towed from 
 30 days after the drunk driver shows up to pick up his suv 
 when he realizes that he owes a lot of money for the towing and storage of the car not to mention his fines and penalties from the police and insurance he flips out punches my dad in the face and runs out of the lot driving away with the guy who drove him there 
 the vehicle is left in the yard 
 police are called it 's all on security cameras and a warrant is issued for his arrest 
 nothing happens the police do n't find the guy and his bill keeps going up for every day it sits 
 he has a guy claiming to be a lawyer phone in every few days but your client has to be here in person for us to release his vehicle '' 
 for obvious reasons arrest mainly that guy is n't showing up 
 so the company proceeds to make a claim for the vehicle 
 dad drives into the city does that and visits the courthouse to take care of another issue when low and behold his assailant just so happens to be there 
 dad calls the police and the courtroom sheriff promptly <unk> him with my dad standing beside him 
 dad laughing all the way casually strikes up a conversation with the sheriff about a pretty nice ford escape i just got for a cheap price '' 
 the guy has n't been sentenced yet but he does have a history with the police 
 why he 'd <unk> someone to a courthouse when there was a warrant for his arrest i 'll never know - i 'm going to assume because he 's not a smart <unk> day last summer i was out and about running some errands when a small car randomly cut me off in a parking lot 
 the driver was on his cell phone and clearly not paying attention 
 over the course of the next little distance he proceeded to cut me off several more times 
 unsure if this guy was genuinely clueless because of the cell phone being held to his ear or if he had some random <unk> against me i decided to put some distance between us 
 unfortunately at the next intersection we were both stopped at the red light 
 the second the red light turned green i heard a honk 
 okay i did n't leave the line as if it were a quarter mile drag but i was n't taking any longer then the average driver 
 then a second honk and i looked in my rear view mirror and this guy is giving me the finger 
 being a little pissed at this guys <unk> driving i decided to throw my truck in park and go confront him 
 it was a stupid idea for so many reasons but sometimes my lack of fear makes me do stupid things 
 i get back to his window and simply ask if there is a problem 
 he puts his phone on his lap and then goes on a rant about how shitty of a driver i am and that i did n't move once the light turned green 
 i asked if he wanted to start over in a more polite way 
 he told me to fuck off then picked his phone back up and i shit you not he said : sorry mom some asshole is blocking the road '' 
 i ripped the phone out of his hand and began walking back to my truck 
 he hopped out and began to charge at me but stopped the moment he realized i was not fucking around and ready to fight back 
 he then asked for his phone back in a decently polite way 
 i told him sure as long as you can catch '' 
 i launched his iphone straight up into the air as high as i could 
 he managed to stumble and miss catching his phone by mere inches 
 it smashed into a million little pieces 
 i immediately felt bad not for breaking his phone - that felt great 
 i felt bad that i was probably going to get in shit by the police and have to deal with that 
 i do n't mind a minor thing like that going on my record it is perfectly spotless otherwise 
 so i decided to go straight to the police in hopes that i could reduce problems by immediately turning myself in 
 at the station the other driver arrived shortly after me - i assume it took him a little bit of time to pick up the pieces of his phone 
 the police spoke to us separately 
 he was first and it took about 15 minutes 
 then the cop came in to speak to me 
 he said : i have issued him two tickets one for distracted driving cellphones are banned while driving and one for reckless driving 
 he has had three complaints and written warnings for other similar situations where he was on his cell phone and nearly caused <unk> so i do n't believe him when he tells me he was n't on his cell phone 
 as for you you should n't break peoples cell phones or even confront them no matter how bad their driving is 
 report them to us and we will deal with it 
 on a personal level i bet that felt good 
 have a good day and remember not to get into any of these <unk> '' 
 i laughed at the outcome of that 
 i walked outside and seen the other driver pulling out of the lot 
 i gave him the most smug smile and wave i could muster up 
 <unk> : bad drivers cuts me off several times 
 when i confront him he verbally attacks me 
 i smashed his phone 
 police <unk> with me and gave the other driver two <unk> ... some dude stole my brand new iphone <unk> <unk> out of my hands at starbucks 
 when he was running out the door he was hit by a ambulance 
 he kept running but he dropped his phone 
 i have his phone pictures of him his facebook page his boss 's number his position at his job naked picture of some chick thats not his girlfriend etc ... my phone is now in lost mode and i see where it is on the map the police are informed our insurance will cover it and again i have his phone with all his contacts including his boss and girlfriend 
 should i let it go and take my insurance check or take my insurance check and ruin this guy 's life 
 ruin his life you say 
 looks like this jerk stole the wrong guy 's iphone 
 thanks 
 my sophomore year in high school i <unk> against a girl 
 did n't have a problem with it until i discovered that she was a cheating dirty bitch 
 she had long finger nails and kept jabbing me in the side 
 i was n't sure if she was doing it intentionally until after i <unk> her when she scratched my arm from elbow to wrist 
 she grabbed my arm dug her nails in and dragged her nails down to my hand 
 without a doubt i knew she was trying to scratch me 
 i pointed this out to the ref after the first period and she said it was an accident 
 i pointed out the red marks on my ribs under my <unk> where she had been jabbing me but he just <unk> it off and ignored my complaints 
 so in the second period she was on bottom and i was on top and my back was to the ref so his vision was blocked 
 i quickly gave her two quick rabbit punches in the face 
 i do n't care that she was a girl 
 if you intentionally play unfair then you have to face some consequences 
 she had probably been getting away with that shit because she was a girl up until then 
 after i decked her she finished the rest of the match fairly 
 she did n't even bother trying to complain to the ref about how i put her back in <unk> 15 years ago i had a horrible boss 
 this guy was an asshole and liked it 
 it went beyond being demanding or easy to anger 
 he actually took pleasure in trying to humiliate and belittle everyone in every single conversation he had with them 
 he was a director and let it go to his head 
 this guy would demand you do something and when you did it demand to know who told you to do it 
 and when you said it was him he would smile and threaten your job 
 i avoided him as best i could 
 however at one point a posting in another state opened up and i wanted the job 
 i asked for and was given said posting 
 i was told to be in that state in two weeks 
 i broke the lease on my apartment and paid the difference 
 my wife quit her job 
 we went out there on our own dime and found a place to live 
 two days before we were set to move i get the call 
 it 's the asshole boss 
 do n't bother going out there i have decided to eliminate the posting 
 i was livid 
 my life was totally interrupted and when i complained i was told i had an attitude problem 
 i stewed for a few days but then found a position at another company in the state i wanted to be in and moved out there anyway 
 i came to find out that eventually this asshole director took another job at the competition 
 all went well for awhile but then he got greedy and began negotiations with yet another company ... using his corporate email address 
 like a fucking idiot 
 they obviously found out and fired his ass 
 but the icing on the cake was that the other company he was talking with never gave him the job after all ... so there he was jobless 
 this was pleasure enough for me 
 total schadenfreude 
 through a friend who knows the asshole i found out that he never seemed to get a job after that 
 6 months went <unk> 12 ... then 18 ... then 2 years ... then 4 years ... he got poorer and poorer 
 his hot wife left him and took his children with her 
 he was sleeping in an empty house which was eventually foreclosed and he got kicked out of it 
 at this point things get <unk> because even my friend did n't know where he was 
 he may have been in the street 
 he may have moved in with his <unk> mother 
 meanwhile my own career had been on an <unk> arc and i was climbing higher up that corporate ladder 
 it was n't long before his resume ended up on my desk 
 it 's a small industry 
 normally i would have tossed out his application because everyone and their mother in this <unk> knew he was caught courting the competition on the company dime 
 his reputation as a total ass was well known 
 and the job he applied for was low level 
 i mean 10 bucks an hour low level grunt work 
 he was a former director at 6 figures and now was willing to work shitty work at a shitty wage just to feed himself 
 anyone would have considered him <unk> including me 
 but i had to have him in my office 
 i wanted to see him on the other side of my desk asking me for bread <unk> like a common street <unk> 
 i wanted to see this asshole who nearly ruined my and a dozen others lives and laughed at it <unk> for a job at my fucking feet 
 so of course i scheduled an interview 
 i was going to waste his time like he wasted mine 
 it was one of the most pleasurable experiences i have ever had 
 he pretended not to recognize me but i could see that he did 
 he had gotten <unk> and reeked of <unk> 
 he had no idea that i knew the whole story so he lied to me about the whole reason he was out of work and when i told him exactly why he looked defeated 
 i told him i had no place for a liar let alone an asshole and when he tried to shake my hand at the end of the interview '' i refused and asked him to leave 
 there is an old saying : you see the same people on the way down as on the way up '' last weekend i attended the beer fest in <unk> <unk> canada 
 the whole thing seemed like it was laid out and planned by a 12 year old with a lot of bottle necks dead ends and zero gathering areas 
 so because of this it was pretty slow to walk around the whole place 
 my husband and i did n't mind we would just grab 2 samples from each stand we went to so we would never go thirsty between vendors 
 there was one girl however that felt the need to get somewhere as quickly as she could 
 my husband and i had just picked up our latest beer samples and began walking towards where the rest of our friends were standing 
 there was a long line of people in front of us trying as well to get to the other side of the venue 
 it was slow as you had to stop every 2 seconds to avoid spilling beer on some one or disrupting small groups trying to hold conversations but everyone was polite and would move out of your way as quickly as they could 
 so we 're on our way my husband leading the way but there 's a woman behind me with her cell phone literally on my back texting away who keeps bumping into me since she 's not paying attention 
 we had to stop at the corner where there was a massive bottle neck she ran directly into me and then i hear her say this is n't going to work for me '' and proceeds to push my arm trying to bulldoze past me which in turn causes me to spill some of my beer on my husbands arm and my forearm 
 upon seeing this the woman behind me turns to her boyfriend and laughs then again proceeds to try to push past us 
 revenge mode kicks in and all i can think of is the <unk> of instant karma this cunt needs 
 so with my beer still in my hand i quickly turn towards her at the same time she is trying to push past us my arm hits hers which proceeds to fling the entire contents of my beer cup all over her chest and face 
 of course i apologize immensely as she stands there in disbelief 
 she <unk> away in one direction as i turn back and get another beer from the closest vendor 
 victory is mine and the next beer tasted delicious 
 tl dr - girl at beer fest thinks she is important enough to push me from behind so i <unk> '' spill my entire beer all over her chest and <unk> 'm <unk> this here after some people suggested i do so through both pm 's and <unk> hints in the comments 
 so i started working in a photo lab for a popular store a few years ago and i was trained by a girl who had worked there for about six years 
 i honestly think she was <unk> or something 
 some days she would be super sweet to me and other days she would rip my head off for the most minor stuff omg <unk> you put a fucking <unk> in the pen drawer 
 heads are gon na roll '' 
 she always made me really nervous that i was fucking up my job constantly complained about everything i did and was just a really crazy bitch to everyone that worked there 
 one time she freaked out and told me that dozens of customers had lodged complaints about me she never specified about what 
 when i asked my store manager he had no idea what she was talking about 
 she was just nuts and i think she enjoyed trying to make me feel bad which is tough since i 'm pretty <unk> 
 anyways at the end of the night i would have to remove this film rack out of the film processor and put it in a bowl of water to keep the <unk> from drying out 
 in the morning when she would open she would take it down from the shelf by the sink and put it back in the film processor for the day 
 in my own form of petty revenge i began to fill the bowl each night exactly to the brim then i would set it on the very edge of the top shelf which was juuuust out of her reach 
 in the mornings she would have to stand on <unk> to get it down and inevitably the water would <unk> down on her as she <unk> with the bowl 
 she bitched at me in passing a few times but i kept it up 
 she started hanging up signs that said not to fill the bowl all the way or not to put it on the top shelf but i ignored these and would <unk> to myself a little each night as i did this 
 she got more and more pissed off trying to complain to my store manager he pretty much ignored everything she said because it was well-known that she was a crazy drama queen that tried to get everyone in trouble for something or other 
 anyways i guess i cracked her because one day she was trying to complain to him about it and he was n't really listening and refused to write me up for something so silly 
 she ended up throwing a notebook at him as hard as she could and he fired her on the spot 
 he promoted me to her job head photo and i got a <unk> an hour raise 
 it 's such a petty revenge but i really got a kick out of hearing other coworkers tell me how she would storm out of the lab in a huff with water dripping down her face and a <unk> shirt every morning 
 a few times it really just <unk> down and soaked her completely 
 it warms the <unk> of my heart 
 <unk> water <unk> out stone not through force but through <unk> <unk> <unk> person who had my number before me was mexican girl 
 her boyfriend is moocher 
 they lived together he had her put everything except his cell phone in her name as his history with the utilities was bad 
 mg catches him cheating on her 
 does she confront him 
 does she get in a fight with with him 
 nope 
 she just moved out 
 remember how i said everything is in her name 
 mg tells landlord she is moving out 
 no no one else lives there 
 landlord did not know about boyfriend 
 mg tells electric company to shut off the power 
 no one is living there 
 mg tells cable company to end service 
 no one is living there 
 mg tells water company to shut off water 
 no one is living there 
 mg tells phone company to shut off land line 
 no one is living there 
 mg tells mutual friends he moved out and does not care where he is living 
 mg has her mail forwarded to new address 
 no one is living at old address 
 so he is sitting in the dark unable to leave because landlord changed the locks 
 he ca n't take a shower as there is no water 
 ca n't watch tv due to no power or cable 
 how do i know all this 
 he called her and left several long messages complaining about it 
 and since the number is now mine ... tl : dr moocher cheats and becomes homeless and powerless 
 edit fixed section on lock <unk> mods on /r/pettyrevenge removed this without telling me so i guess i 'll try here 
 i used to work at an expensive <unk> with a boss the owner who fired me for being gay 
 this was illegal here already but i was paid so poorly that i could n't afford a lawyer to sue him 
 however he had n't thought to check with his biggest client before getting rid of me and they made him hire me back 
 because i unfortunately needed the money and jobs were scarce here at the time i took it 
 in addition to my part time consulting duties i was also responsible for booking all the consultants gigs and their travel arrangements 
 and while the owner was the owner he also did occasional consulting 
 all consulting was <unk> travel to the client and we had clients all over the country 
 so whenever a client called and asked for a consultant - which was often - i 'd just check the owner 's <unk> and if i had n't already booked him for that week i 'd do so 
 preferably as far away as possible 
 i 'd ship him out on sunday and fly him home on saturday 
 he 'd come home saturday afternoon <unk> he 'd have just barely a day to recover and see his family and then he 'd have to leave for the airport to fly out for the next gig 
 the clients were <unk> - they thought he was the best man we had 
 he was n't but they thought he was 
 he could n't complain partly because it made him a lot of money and partly because i made sure he was never there to complain 
 also he was a weird guy who insisted on <unk> my computer programming work to the point that before he 'd leave he 'd tell me do n't do anything on that until i get back '' and he meant it - if i did any work on my work while he was away he 'd be irate but if i sat on my ass until his return he 'd be fine with it 
 so he told me do n't do anything on that until i get back '' thinking he 'd be back the next week ... and i kept him away for about four months 
 during which time i booked the consultants and serviced my one client which all added up to working about one to two days a week and then sat in my office and read <unk> 
 this was <unk> 
 and he had to pay me for it 
 as i said this went on for about four months until his <unk> wife appeared in my office one day <unk> over me and in a very quiet voice informed me that she would like her husband back 
 <unk> this for the quite severe threat it was i took pity on her and changed some <unk> so he could come home 
 i let him stay home for the birth of his child and for exactly the amount of paternity leave he said he 'd be taking and then i sent him away again 
 note : i had no intention of making him miss the birth of his child but his wife wanted him home a bit earlier than i 'd planned so i played it her way 
 i liked her despite her husband 
 *do <unk> <unk> against me and then put me in charge of your schedule unless you want to be away from your wife for months and exhausted all the <unk> sure if this should be posted here it is a little more dramatic than most stories you might see here and im not sure if it counts as pro revenge '' 
 tl dr at the bottom a bit of backstory first : a long time ago when i lived with my family i was a handful to deal with i was diagnosed <unk> getting into fights all the time and had severe anger issues 
 my mother and sister had no idea how to deal with me 
 not going to deny i was a shit of a kid 
 i also happened to be the smartest in my family besides my stepfather who did n't live with us when it came to the subject of computers 
 so i was the go to guy when it came to computers for my friends and for my family 
 my family are actually the most computer <unk> people i 've ever met 
 in any case when i started coming into my teens i became less of a shit learned to control my anger a lot more and did n't get into fights as much 
 i really really was trying to change my ways 
 i also had a secret that i was hiding from my family and that was that i was gay 
 when i was <unk> i came out of the closet to my family 
 cue homophobic insults for the next two years 
 my mother and sister showed no <unk> especially when near eachother 
 one on their own was usually fine though my sister would make passing comments like calling me disgusting 
 i often hid in my room away from them but they would bang on my door calling me slurs my mother would frequently remind me how she was going to disown me and did n't care where i ended up 
 this often brought me to tears and as a result i felt myself becoming a very angry and depressed person 
 when i was 18 my mother kicked me out of home 
 over the next year after becoming <unk> i began to realize the struggles my mother faced as a single mother especially with me 
 the struggles of dealing with my violent stepfather who ended up winning custody of my younger sister 
 i concluded that her reaction to be coming out was probably some form of revenge but ultimately found out that she just disagreed with it 
 though she does hold a lot of resentment towards how i acted when i was a kid over the next 3 years i tried getting in contact with them on and off just to sit down and talk aside our differences but coming from a family from <unk> west talking civilly is not my families strong suit 
 every attempt the usual insults were thrown back at me <unk> '' this i will never accept your choice '' 
 that from both my mother and sister 
 this went on for three years i had given up on them at this point 
 now during those three years my sister had a kid of her own and my mother and stepfather finally ended their tolerance '' of one another 
 as such my stepfather was no longer fixing my mothers computer 
 so on the fourth year 2013 guess who suddenly is interested in speaking to her daughter again 
 my mother would call me asking about her smartphone and her computers and whatnot every so often 
 i was annoyed by it but i figured this might be an opportunity to at least open the doors to us being able to be civil with one another so i helped her just to see where it would go 
 i would travel two hours out help her fix her stuff and leave 
 i eventually installed <unk> on her computer in order to curb the <unk> it would take me 
 every so often i would mention to her mum i 'm your daughter as well you know not just your technician '' her responses to that were generally just <unk> and then nothing would change 
 over the course of 6 months she would continue to call me asking for <unk> help and i would oblige 
 but i would occasionally mention the above to her again 
 skip forward i find out that my mother has cancer and has basically told every family member except me 
 i confronted her about it she seemed very <unk> about it as if it was normal for me not to be told stuff like this 
 a few months ago i sent her a long message detailing why i can no longer help her because it was giving me false hope which was ignored but seen '' until i pressed the matter 
 her response was telling me i deserved to be kicked out that i made her life more stressful than the cancer ever did and that i 'm a freak who she will never accept 
 she said she will never seek <unk> with me because i am apparently the one who is <unk> and so she <unk> have to 
 i blocked her on facebook and deleted her number 
 at this point i felt like i had chased them enough feeling guilty and that i 'm done trying to make up for it 
 ** -- backstory over -- ** ** -- the revenge -- ** skip forward a few weeks my sister messages me for help 
 her computer screen is broken and she is worried about her sons photos 
 **me : ** hey who is this 
 i had deleted her number so i did n't know it was her initially <unk> it 's ** sister ** my computer <unk> is <unk> & amp im <unk> <unk> if i can get my fotos off **me : ** you know i 'm sick of this computer shit right 
 fuck off 
 **her : ** <unk> mate all i <unk> ws 2 no if i <unk> get my sons fotos off 
 eat a fat one 
 **me : ** you 'll put on a friendly face when you need my help but the moment i decline you show me what you truly think of me 
 <unk> to an angry demeanor and <unk> what you know to be <unk> insults 
 hopefully you can work on that in years to come so your son does n't pick up this <unk> of yours and become a bully 
 **her : ** fuck off <unk> 
 im trying to figure out how to save every single <unk> i own of him since birth so dont u dare comment on my angry demeanor '' 
 all i wanted to know is if there was a way 
 **me : ** my going rate is $ 22 an hour **her : ** fuck off 
 **me : <unk> me why should i care 
 i do n't know your son i do n't know you 
 you 're just this jackass who <unk> insults at me every now and again 
 oh and between insults you ask me for help 
 that 's who you have been to me for the last 4 years 
 that got rid of her and then two days ago my mother messages me basically saying she thinks shes being hacked 
 <unk> : ** i do n't think it was a good idea to leave log me in enabled like you suggested 
 someone got into my computer **me : ** do n't care 
 it 's no longer my problem i did n't care 
 i could 've easily helped both of them could have reassured my mother gotten my sisters photos off but after all of that fuck those guys 
 **tl dr** family treat me like shit for the better part of a decade for being gay decide to pretend it never happens when they want my help with computer related stuff 
 i help them for a bit 
 mum has cancer and tells everyone but me 
 i tell her i ca n't help her anymore 
 she <unk> out at me but asks me for help months later because shes being hacked 
 i decline helping her 
 sister also asks for help recovering her sons photos from her failing computer i also decline helping her 
 end edit : added a bit more to phone <unk> i was the odd kid who moved into the neighborhood 
 got messed with a bit but had a lot of friends so things were pretty cool 
 this would have been in <unk> or so 
 my mom died in <unk> and we moved away for a couple of years 
 i came back in <unk> i think 
 so there was this kid in the neighborhood who was just the worst kind of kid 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> three older brothers who tormented the hell out of him and he was the local <unk> and i was his target that year 
 now i had been pretty reserved before but having my mom die moving three times in 4 years and being kind of lost ... well i was just a good target 
 this ass had been picking on me most of the year 
 little crap pushing shoving knocking my stuff out of my hands 
 i just took it like an idiot 
 i 'd tear up and man that would make his day 
 i hated that kid with a <unk> heat 
 we 're getting off the bus one day and asshat is behind me 
 as i begin my first step down the bus stairs he puts his foot into my back and just <unk> me out of the door of the bus 
 i fly out and land on my face with my arms and legs splayed in the dirt 
 i 'll bet it was absolutely hilarious to see as everybody burst into laughter 
 asshat is there pointing and leading the laughter 
 i push myself to my feet and in the same motion bring my right arm up and over my shoulder in a rapidly descending arc 
 at the end of my <unk> is my six million dollar man lunch <unk> with the matching thermos 
 said arc is interrupted by <unk> skull 
 the sound of the metal bending and the glass in the thermos breaking are forever embedded in my memory 
 i left him <unk> in the dirt 
 the bus driver looked at me closed the door and drove off 
 when i got home i put my lunch box on the counter and got myself some milk and <unk> 
 my dad asked what happened to my lunch box 
 i told him i broke it hitting asshat in the head 
 never got messed with again in that neighborhood 
 tl/dr bully messes with me 
 i crush his head with a lunch <unk> 'm handicapped 
 you ca n't see it by looking at me unless you are an <unk> machine 
 the people who hand out handicapped tags recognize my disability 
 i live in an area that on one end is middle class and on the other end is really really wealthy 
 my family in laws and all of my doctors are on the wealthy end 
 there is no shortage of <unk> bmws and even the occasional <unk> taking up handicapped spaces 
 you sort of get used to it 
 enter real estate bitch reb 
 she is the worst kind - a repeat offender 
 reb drives a little <unk> convertible 
 i know she 's in real estate because her license plate frame lists her name agency and phone number and it 's framing a vanity plate with her first name on it 
 and i know she 's a bitch because every time i go to see my neurologist <unk> <unk> <unk> center and ms clinic all in the same place above a <unk> shopping center she 's in a handicapped space the other 2 have handicapped tagged cars in them 
 i collectively go to these doctors at least once a week sometimes more 
 i do n't know why she started coming to the <unk> center but she 's a problem 
 i got her <unk> twice 
 no change 
 i call her office first politely then rudely 
 i leave messages for her boss 
 nothing 
 the center 's management was in the process of adding a new bank of handicapped spaces so all they did was tell me to be patient 
 one day i 'm in to see the neurologist 
 things are n't good 
 my medicine has stopped working there is new damage to my brain 
 i 'm depressed <unk> with these new symptoms and i felt like <unk> 
 and she was in the space 
 i snapped 
 i dumped my <unk> out onto the hood of my car desperate for anything to <unk> <unk> that shining mercedes and ruin her day 
 i snapped pens open and <unk> the ink over her windshield wipers 
 i wasted a damn good lipstick writing <unk> spaces are n't for cunts like you on the windshield and that lipstick would really stay on there 
 i opened up <unk> of baby food and painted the windows making sure to line the crack at the bottom so when she rolled them down it would fall in 
 and then i remembered - i had a dirty diaper 
 i ca n't dispose those in my mom 's trash cans mom 's <unk> these days so if i have to change my son when i drop him off for babysitting i just stick it in a plastic bag and throw it away 5 minutes later when i 'm at the shopping center 
 it almost never happens 
 actually it had never happened before i was just <unk> that day when it did 
 i tore that bag open opened the diaper and smeared every door handle the grill of her car her side mirrors and that fucking vanity plate and the frame around it 
 i knew i was walking into bad news at this doctor 's visit but i was riding high 
 you could n't have sunk my spirits with a lead weight 
 i never saw her car in one of the spaces again 
 edit : thank you all for your kind thoughts and concern 
 i am doing well my ms is n't too bad i just get <unk> when i get bad news 
 then i snap out of it 
 i have relapsing <unk> ms <unk> which means my symptoms and their severity come and go 
 it will be really horrible for two weeks and then pretty manageable for the rest of the year 
 i have the handicapped tag because the one <unk> that sticks around is <unk> and walking from the back of a large parking lot does n't help 
 this situation happened <unk> months ago my memory is <unk> because i have a 3 year old <unk> does that to you and i have yet to face legal consequences 
 i was too enraged to be sneaky about it so i 'm sure somebody saw me but nobody did anything about it 
 score one for me 
 edit 2 : i do get revenge on one time offenders in other ways 
 at a grocery store 
 i 'll leave my empty cart right next to the driver side door and make you go put it with the other carts 
 do i have a pen and paper on hand 
 you 'll get a massive guilt trip tucked under your windshield wiper 
 parked like an asshole in the handicapped access aisle 
 i 'll try to park on the left of your vehicle close enough that it 's a really tight squeeze to get in 
 this time we were providing pa and backline for an african tour 
 we had a run of a few shows every couple of days 
 they started off ok i have a million <unk> fail type stories although not all of them would be <unk> for prorevenge 
 typical african <unk> though wanting to soundcheck for 5hours before performing for another 5hours ... these are long days also the level of professionalism that we are all used to goes out the window when you are dealing with inexperienced promoters and label reps who are new to this country and the near clinical way in which we operate 
 we run things like a military operation 
 if you think that every gig is run by stoned out <unk> who sit watching <unk> tap every day on the <unk> you are mostly mistaken 
 like i said we run things strictly on time and we follow safety procedures and everyone on the crew is professional 
 we <unk> when people expect us to lower our standards to theirs 
 so anyway we did some shows and the rule for this tour due to the volatile nature of the events people in the audience like to stab and kill each other every show so there 's a risk of police <unk> every show 
 we decide to <unk> the <unk> of payment for the following show at the end of the night 
 in other words on <unk> we got paid for that show and also the next show2 
 we turn up for show2 and also get paid for <unk> etc ... we are at <unk> and at the end of the night we could n't find the promoter it 's a thursday and the next show is in london on the saturday night 
 no stress we load out of the venue and i drop a text to the promoter 
 **me : ** hey missed you tonight 
 can you arrange to bank transfer the payment over to me for saturdays show '' 
 no response that night he must be tired and gone to bed 
 next day friday he calls me up and says he will wire me the money asap 
 i tell him that i wo n't be <unk> for london until 10am on saturday morning it 's a <unk> drive from me he has until then to transfer me the money or i will assume the show is cancelled 
 me and the rest of the team agree to call each other around 10am to check if the gig is on ... next day saturday at 10am i check the bank 
 no funds no <unk> funds nothing ... zip 
 we all switch our phones off and have a day out with our respective friends and families 
 a nice day off 
 around 4pm i decide to switch my phone on i 'm coming out of the cinema with my girlfriends 
 my phone <unk> i glance at the screen 
 <unk> calls a dozen answer phone messages and texts from the promoter 
 just as i 'm about to laugh out loud the phone rings 
 its the promoter ... **promoter : ** hey so ... <unk> ... where are you '' 
 **me : ** i 'm just outside the cinema on the way to nandos '' **promoter : ** laughs nervously errr ... you do know there 's a show tonight right '' 
 **me : ** <unk> ... no there 's not '' i reply quite <unk> 
 **promoter : ** what do you mean 
 i 'm at the venue now with the band 
 where are you '' 
 **me : ** i 'm on my way to nandos for dinner im <unk> away 
 the backline and pa is in a truck a further <unk> away 
 all the crew are having a day off like i said there is no show tonight '' 
 remember how i said we were <unk> pa and <unk> 
 ** the <unk> were stood around onstage with no drums no <unk> no amps no pa system no techs ... not even a cable 
 the promoter starts stressing big time on the phone to me pleading with me to <unk> the show 
 i ask him what time the doors are 
 he says <unk> **me : ** ok look here 's the thing 
 it 'll take me an hour to get to the truck it 's a 3 hour drive to london it 'll take another hour to load in and another <unk> to setup for your show 
 it 's 4pm now so that means we wo n't be ready to go for another 10 hours '' 
 **promoter : ** you mean 7 hours '' 
 **me : ** no because by the time you have personally driven up here to pay me my money before i set off that 's going to be another <unk> which makes 10 '' 
 **promoter : ** <unk> <unk> <unk> '' suddenly realising he has fucked up and will have to refund the entire show 
 i might sound harsh but this promoter has repeatedly tried to screw me and many of my colleagues over many times over the years 
 he plays up to his <unk> little <unk> type character 
 his boss the head <unk> was not happy with him 
 we turned up for the tuesday show because we got paid in advance on the monday 
 after tuesday 's show we were paid in full for the rest of the tour ... a further 10 shows 
 in 1996 i was working at a vets office in high point nc during my lunch break i would drive down the road about half a mile to a game store beside an office depot to see what was available 
 leaving the game store i saw a guy in a 1997 forest green bmw with dealer plates pull in on my drivers side slightly <unk> blocking me in 
 i asked the guy if he could move his car a bit so i could pull out and he said that my piece of shit should be in a <unk> not on the road i was driving a <unk> ford <unk> <unk> with a <unk> super <unk> jet and <unk> <unk> <unk> not a piece of shit by any means 
 i attempt to pull out a few times but since im driving a land <unk> its not happening 
 getting more and more pissed off i decided hell with this guy cut my wheel hard right and just back out normally the front bumper of my car hits right in front of the passenger door and proceeds to tear off the front door rear door and rear quarter panel as i 'm backing out 
 i got out of there as quickly and possible and went back to work 
 for about 6 months i was worried that one day the cops would show up at my door for the hit and run but they never <unk> friends and i have all been frequenting this neighborhood bar for the past year or so 
 it 's popular usually fairly busy and cheap enough 
 so as most bars go it has the one guy '' named brian the tool thats there every single night you go and you feel like he 's there on all the nights you do n't go to wearing one of the same 3 <unk> he owns that all feature a fedora and <unk> the <unk> full of out of place and <unk> heavy metal 
 and of course hitting on everything with a vagina 
 you know the type the one that starts with the women so far out of his league they are dots from where he is standing and works his way down 
 the one that will literally pause between <unk> and do a full scan of the bar before deciding which girl is hot enough to pursue next 
 after having his fedora called out by us the first and only time he gave us a chance he never tried again but he was a permanent <unk> in the bar 
 what really upset me about brian the tool was how he treated a particular <unk> michelle 
 now michelle was a sweet heart and possibly the nicest girl you 'll ever meet but she was also chris <unk> 's long lost sister 
 i 'm not joking i wish i had a picture because this girl was what happened if you slapped a dark cherry <unk> on tommy boy 
 she also didnt believe in make up 
 at any rate every night if brian could n't score himself a pity fuck i 'm going to say i saw him get one twice in 3 months and michelle was around he 'd take her home 
 he would n't speak to her all night and she once mentioned to me how she didnt even have his cell phone number but if she was there she would wait patiently until the bar shut down and him to bump her <unk> <unk> 
 it was one of the <unk> things too each time it happened he would approach her like a kid who just got clothes on xmas and sadly whisper the first sentence to her he had all night 
 then he would leave and she didnt seem to be allowed to follow him out for 5 minutes as though he didnt want us to know but we all knew 
 at any rate since we could n't help michelle we mentioned it was degrading but she would n't have it so you can only let <unk> <unk> to <unk> we gave up and let them do their dance every week 
 flash forward 3 months and i 'm invited to a wedding by a guy i 've been seeing 
 walk through the door and there 's brian ... with a very decent looking girl 
 immediately upon seeing me brian refuses to make contact and <unk> his <unk> far far away 
 i figure she 's just a date he somehow <unk> so i think nothing of it 
 in passing i mention to my date that i know the guy and get the response oh yeah 
 that 's kristin 's fiancé '' 
 come again 
 oh yeah kristin is this super sweet nurse studying to become a <unk> and has been dating brian for 2 years engaged for six months 
 apparently to help put herself through school and help support her apartment with brian who works as a very fancy temp worker at an amazon warehouse kristin outs in 10 hour overnight shifts at the hospital 
 suddenly its clear how brian gets away with going to the bar and pussy scouting every night : his girls earning money and investing in the future and he 's getting his dick wet with literally anything that will take it 
 now this is a wedding 
 love is in the air and the words trust honor and <unk> '' are the <unk> 
 and i am pissed at this useless good for nothing asshat that treats women like a <unk> of <unk> wet holes for his taking 
 also his <unk> were just really fucking stupid quietly without telling my date i sneak up behind the tool and corner him 
 he goes into deer in headlights mode and kristin seems annoyed i guess women pop up all the time 
 hey brian 
 remember me 
 i 'm the girl from insert bar name '' 
 kristin reacts subtly to the bars name 
 i get the feeling she 's told brian she does n't want him going here 
 oh yeah hey '' 
 yeah 
 hey last weekend i let michelle borrow my lighter '' kristin turns her head to look at brian 
 michelle is a familiar name 
 uh 
 okay '' 
 well i asked her for it the other day but she said she lost it 
 i was wondering if it was on your floor '' 
 i get a nasty spiteful retaliation from brian basically saying fuck no but the damage was done 
 i watch kristin storm away <unk> and cant help but smile smugly as i watch him chase her 
 a half an hour later both of them are gone from the wedding party 
 tl dr : fuck <unk> wasn’t quite sure if i should post this in <unk> or /r/pettyrevenge but its more about karma revenge than anything else 
 back in my high school days i was the typical <unk> <unk> male computer geek 
 i was quiet kept to myself pretty much the stereotypical <unk> nerd who loved to read books and play video games 
 i had my share of bully stories and random kids that picked on me but one particular <unk> bitch had it in for me 
 let’s call her valerie battitude for the sake of this story 
 i was in her <unk> nearly every day for the 4 years i attended high school 
 val and her <unk> group of friends would torment me <unk> to the point i attempted suicide at a particular low point in my life 
 the constant name calling the snide remarks questioning of my sexuality the bullying never stopped even with administration intervention 
 high school wasn’t particularly bad for me but it was val who made my life a literal living hell 
 i was powerless because she was the queen bitch and i had at least one class with her every semester 
 high school ends and i get my college degree 
 my career takes off and i advance several times 
 sadly my company hits hard times and i 'm laid off along with most of my staff 
 months turn into nearly a year as i’m waiting for my next job but my emergency <unk> egg is getting low 
 in order to support myself i take up an old part-time tech job working for my former employer 
 he was glad to have me back and i got to pick up some extra cash doing in-home tech work on the side while i continued the job search 
 my boss gets a call from a long time client and sends me out to handle it 
 it’s pretty <unk> on paper but after checking the name it dawns on me that this client is the father of <unk> battitude 
 i instantly have horrible <unk> of all the <unk> i went through in hs 
 realizing i’m not the same <unk> geek in hs i swallow my hateful pride to knock on the door 
 father battitude greets me <unk> and we briefly <unk> with idle <unk> 
 i do n't let him on that i knew his *** of a daughter nor that she was the bane of my existence in my hs days 
 i do find out that his daughter is temporarily staying back at <unk> home as she is out traveling the country for work 
 he had divorced from <unk> battitude who took half his savings account over an unnamed incident that led me to believe she cheated on him 
 clue # 1 : figured out where val got her bad attitude from 
 we get down to business and he explains his computer problem s 
 the main issue being that the <unk> of a pc is practically a relic of <unk> <unk> fuel by modern day <unk> 
 i quickly demise no amount of software repair and malware removal is going to fix the speed problem he 's facing 
 it takes a whopping 20 minutes to boot into the log in screen and i ball my fist into a tight ball when i see val battitude '' 's name as the secondary accounts on the windows login screen 
 <unk> it off i recommend to papa that getting a new computer rather than spending the hours it will take trying to get it back up to merely poor standards 
 he agrees and wants me to go with him the store and pick one <unk> that day 
 i’m conflicted as this is the father of <unk> baby but it’s obviously not entirely his fault his daughter is the bitch from hell ... so i say what the hell '' and agree 
 i call my boss and he 's ok with me doing some consulting work over the pc repair he originally sent me on 
 i 'm off the clock on by my bosses standards and it’s off to xyz computer store 
 we are shooting the breeze at what he does for a living but mostly it’s about how he is proud that his daughter is an entrepreneur for some startup company on the web and how she is constantly traveling the state and country 
 i 'm controlling my gag <unk> from the puffy clouds and <unk> <unk> his daughter <unk> 
 how can he talk about the very same person that would knock my lunch into the ground and then <unk> step on it while looking at me in the eye and mock “i’m sooooo sorry ” we get to the store and i find out through <unk> with him and the sales associate that his computer we are replacing is actually val 's old college computer that he recently commandeered while she was away 
 food for thought ... enough technical <unk> to sink a <unk> and 3 hours later : father battitude is the proud owner of a new <unk> computer and wireless network system 
 i install the new pc get it up and running along with the new printer wifi multiple accounts setup along with windows remote access in case he needs my boss to log in for basic help standard procedure 
 i move onto installing the old harddrive for the data transfer and father battitude has long since vacated the room to go watch tv elsewhere 
 my <unk> and disgust <unk> as my eyes <unk> across the documents of valerie 's personal files 
 the data transfer starts reading off odd file name that catch my eye 
 it doesn’t occur to me given the source just what i’m seeing <unk> across the screen so i manually follow the path to said directory of her old <unk> <unk> harddrive 
 the discovery of several thousand <unk> of personal porn pictures and hardcore webcam videos <unk> me in my tracks 
 this was n't the <unk> gifted entrepreneur daughter papa battitude had led on about 
 this was an <unk> webcam <unk> who was out touring the country doing porn or hooking up with her latest fling 
 my curiosity turned into disgust and contempt as i <unk> through several dozen more photos of <unk> and occasional kinky stuff where she is degrading men or causing pain 
 i have no problem in general with what someone does for a living 
 my thoughts were at that instant that this bitch is using men and continuing to cause more pain even after hs 
 i had more reason to despise and hate her over anyone else ... and i had her in the palm of my hands 
 wheels started turning daddy was obviously none the <unk> to what his daughter did for a living and my conscience started a personal war with my ego 
 at one end was my <unk> to extract revenge and the other was my <unk> saying to forgive and let it go 
 i settled on a happy medium that both sides gleefully agreed with 
 my fear of being sued or that i could get my boss into some serious trouble prevented me from going too far so an evil little revenge scheme would have to suffice 
 i uploaded all the files in question to my remote file server and got to work figuring out the best way to humiliate a <unk> <unk> 
 papa <unk> was enthusiastically watching a game that would occupy him for a few hours so i took the time to organized all her photos and videos onto her newly created desktop 
 each folder got a unique <unk> name as i filled each one with her personal pictures of shame and degradation 
 i started to get more and more creative as i began to have fun with it 
 valerie of <unk> class of xxxx takes on 2 guys at her <unk> home '' 
 or watch valerie battitude get <unk> on her parents bed '' 
 i was cackling with glee as i rigged the <unk> de gras 
 none of the files could be <unk> without administration approval 
 guess who had that 
 <unk> 
 two weeks later i get the <unk> i was waiting for from my boss 
 father battitude request that i take a look at his <unk> login account as there was something wrong with it 
 the look on her face when i showed up at her father 's doorstep was priceless 
 anger and rage quickly sinks into horror and regret as it dawns on her just who was behind all this 
 the next half hour was mostly <unk> and her saying sorry '' a thousand times over 
 i 'm a <unk> at heart but like captain <unk> <unk> of <unk> says i 'm a good guy ... <unk> the guy in the gut well i 'll settle for just all right 
 **tl : dr version : hs bully gets just <unk> more than a decade later as all of her personal <unk> files are organized and displayed in a humiliating way 
 then is <unk> into meeting face-to-face to her horror 
 ** - edited the name of valerie 
 - edit : i wrote this story to help me with my writing skills 
 write what you know '' 
 please note that i wrote this in an attempt to get in my old self ie character 
 this does not reflect who i am now 
 by simply googling my dead brother 's name i uncovered the pro revenge he attempted to exact on our mother by killing himself 
 i 'm the youngest of three boys 
 my oldest brother committed suicide in 2003 at age 48 without leaving a note ... here 's the story 
 my oldest brother grew up a conflicted man 
 he was brilliant and honest but he had a very volatile relationship with our mother that seemed to center around her attempts to hold onto and control money 
 we all felt this as we were very poor but my oldest brother seemed to take her efforts to deny us the basics of life personally 
 the rest of us felt that our <unk> lifestyle of yard sale clothes no toys <unk> school <unk> dented cans and <unk> bread was simply a product of our <unk> 
 by the time he reached his early 20 's he moved out but continued to stop by and try to engage our mother in arguments designed to teach '' her the errors in her thinking 
 this never went well 
 he eventually went to brown university on a full scholarship and began teaching in an inner city setting 
 it was at this point around <unk> that he began his decent into depression and major mental illness 
 he <unk> with alcohol and <unk> depression meds 
 i could see the changes in him monthly 
 by 1996 he was not the same person that i grew up with 
 he picked verbal fights saw enemies everywhere and began to act out at his job 
 i later learned that it was around this point and i 'll explain how later he decided to commit suicide 
 but he had unfinished business with my mother so he concocted a <unk> scheme aimed to <unk> her at her <unk> moment 
 he purchased a secret life insurance policy named my mother as the <unk> without her knowledge and secretly paid the premium every <unk> despite he and his wife having deep financial issues 
 of course his wife knew nothing of the suicide plans or the policy 
 insurance policies have a lengthy waiting period before they will pay out in the case of a suicide but that 's okay because my brother wanted to have a little fun before killing himself anyway 
 his fun '' included <unk> the concern level of a honey <unk> and messing with every teacher student administrator and <unk> he disliked 
 his devastating intellect was his weapon and he used it to embarrass and shock his targets 
 he eventually was suspended multiple times for verbally assaulting a janitor and for allowing his 7th grade students to cut his hair and drive his car 
 he also created drama by telling stories of bar fights with famous people and lying to get out of attending meetings 
 he had become an out of control prick and was drinking everyday 
 his wife held it together but she was beginning to crack under the pressure 
 all the while my brother was fine because he knew it would all be over soon and he was living his new life of giving zero fucks 
 and his plan to screw with my mother was coming along fine 
 i attempted to get him into numerous programs 
 i even cut ties with him from my own children and told him that all he needed to do was to get into a program and even if he failed could resume our close contact 
 he opted to continue his rampage 
 our parents saw no real need for concern so they did n't join with me 
 my father even expressed anger at me for me giving him that ultimatum 
 around 2000 he began <unk> '' his own death to his classes 
 knowing that 7th graders are very <unk> he <unk> it with being told by <unk> that he would die at home and in a year that ended with a 3. this is what i learned by googling his name about 8 years after his death 
 when i did a link to a video game forum popped up and a pm 8 year-old post by one of his students had made about his teacher dying 
 this is when i realized that my brother 's suicide was <unk> years before he did it 
 i emailed that student and he gave me the whole story of my brother <unk> the class on several occasions with tales of his own death 
 here 's the intended revenge plan and its 8 years too late exposure : in 2011 my mother passed 
 my brother 's death 8 years earlier began her mental and physical breakdown 
 all she wanted to know was <unk> 
 of course we had no idea why 
 but her death triggered a records search at prudential insurance where she had her own policy 
 my dad had begun the wheels in motion by filing for her payout and the search kicked back my brother 's name because that was ironically where he had his secret life insurance policy 
 the agent asked my dad who the person who came back in the search was and my dad stated that it was his oldest son who had committed suicide back in 2003. you see my brother despite his <unk> did n't know how life insurance worked and he assumed that his death would somehow cause his policy to force a payout to my mother 
 this would have happen when all of us were deep in <unk> as to why he would kill himself - and right then my mother would then get the check 
 the check was his suicide note directly to my mother alone ... and it was the one thing that has <unk> their relationship forever ... money 
 but the insurance company did not know of his death in 2003. they assumed he 'd just allowed the policy to lapse 
 my brother 's wife knew nothing of the policy and neither did my mother 
 my dad who is <unk> and failing never connected the dots as he does n't know of my brother <unk> '' his own death 
 my father provided prudential with the copy of the death certificate of both my brother and my mother and they verified that the policy was <unk> at the time of my brother 's suicide and sent my dad the benefits check 
 i 've never told my dad any of this as it would probably kill him 
 i shared the details with my middle brother and he agrees that this was exactly what my oldest brother was up to 
 *edit for clarity : this was my brother 's attempt at revenge 
 obviously he failed by not understanding that insurance companies need to be notified of someone 's death before they pay 
 and yes he was in pain and needed help but he refused it 
 he claimed that he could n't relate to average people '' who were in aa and would n't go 
 he was an <unk> who used his intellect as an excuse to keep drinking and abusing prescription meds 
 he was deeply deeply troubled 
 short time lurker first time poster 
 blah blah blah 
 background : you see kids i was the awkward kid in high school 
 this tale takes place at the end of my sophomore year 
 i had grown up quite a bit since i was a freshman but still had a long ways to go i <unk> in college 
 by the end of my sophomore year i had seen my confidence grow from awkwardly shy to be more <unk> i had a good group of friends and was finally becoming my own person 
 the cast of characters for this tale is short but important : **deb** : girl in my class 
 <unk> thought she was better than everyone else 
 was usually the first to make fun of me for my weight or cheap clothes 
 <unk> : senior girl gal pals with deb 
 also <unk> also thought she was better than everyone else because <unk> her parents had money 
 **me** : myself of course 
 act 1 scene 1 : speech class 
 rest of the class is running lines and prepping for our end of year production 
 i 'm putting the finishing touches on the sound and lighting setup 
 & gt **deb** : hey <unk> how are you doing cutie 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <unk> now keep in mind she was n't even in my speech class ... or the play 
 she was just in there 
 also keep in mind she had treated me like crap for the last two years 
 so when she called me cutie i knew something was up 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <unk> & gt **me** : i 'm ... um ... fine 
 & gt **deb** : dani and i need some help 
 i 'm nearly failing $ statehistory and so is dani 
 we were wondering if you would help us pass our final in $ statehistory 
 the entire time this girl is overtly flirting with me which is very very out of the ordinary and knowing both of these girls the fact that they were n't passing $ statehistory was n't surprising 
 & gt **me** : *i know she does n't mean <unk> so how do you want me to help 
 & gt **deb** : you know how you make an a on every history test 
 we 'd like for you to give us answers 
 & gt **me** : what do i get out of this 
 & gt **deb** : our appreciation 
 <unk> says this as she is lightly running her fingernails down my <unk> & gt **me** : <unk> : i know that this is a lie and that she 'll use and forget me asap 
 i 'm not falling for <unk> so you want me to just give you answers 
 all three of us are taking the test at the same time 
 so deb tells me about her scheme 
 her and dani will sit to my left and behind me 
 all i have to do is lean back and let them see my scantron sheet 
 they 'll fill out their answers and turn them in 
 simple as that 
 thinking to myself : i know that i 'm just being used 
 they 'll do this and continue to treat me like crap 
 however ... & gt **me** : i 'll do it 
 it will cost you $ 20 each up front and in cash 
 in exchange i 'll give you answers for the test 
 deb proceeds to pay up for her and dani 
 **act 2 scene 1** right before the test & gt **me** : <unk> to deb and dani right before the test is handed out 
 * be sure to turn your tests in first if we turn them in at the same time it will look suspicious 
 crazy enough they both <unk> to this while telling me it 's a good idea 
 the test starts and i fill in answers on the scantron and lean back and to the side ... all according to plan 
 ten minutes later they hand in their answer sheets and sit down 
 meanwhile i 've been erasing my answers since they stood up 
 filling in the correct answers that i had lightly marked while filling in the wrong answers the first time on my test 
 of course deb and dani saw this 
 however they could do nothing at this point our teacher had a rule about not changing answers on a test one you handed it in 
 they watched me fill in all the correct answers and turn it in 
 **act 3 final <unk> out in the hallway deb and dani are asking me why i changed the answers on my test 
 & gt **me** : i told you that i would give you answers and i did that but nowhere did i promise you the <unk> answers 
 deb and dani both stomp off 
 later on that day they tell me that their boyfriends are going to beat me up and key my car 
 <unk> <unk> there comes a time in everyone 's life when they learn the consequences of their actions mean something 
 for me i was $ 40 <unk> and a minor hero to everyone who had been on the receiving end of their <unk> 
 on the plus side deb never spoke to me again 
 for them they learned a very important lesson that day 
 one i hope they never forgot 
 especially when they had to repeat the class during the summer 
 especially since during the summer session the teacher handed out timed essay tests rather than multiple choice tests 
 a few years ago i ran into deb 
 she still wo n't speak to me 
 something that upon further <unk> i still consider to be a good thing 
 <unk> tl dr : cheating is bad kids 
 failing at it is even worse 
 edit : formatting over in /r/justiceporn <unk> tells a story about getting revenge on one of his wife 's colleagues & gt so i 'm a bit of a chilli head 
 love my hot sauces 
 i also love to cook 
 i also cook my wife a delicious lunch each day she kept complaining that someone was stealing her lunch every couple of days out of the fridge at work 
 so i made her some buffalo <unk> for lunch to put in the fridge they are really popular with her colleagues but i <unk> them up just a little with some <unk> 's 4am reserve 
 i note you are meant to <unk> it with 1 drop per 5 litres of liquid 
 so i added a couple of drops of blairs 4am reserve per wing with nice dusting of ghost chilli powder for good measure 
 i did eat a couple to make sure it did n't kill anybody they were real hot 
 even cream does n't cut the heat : and ghost <unk> keep getting <unk> for about 5 minutes 
 needless to say just before lunch there was a shrill from the kitchen a young male college decided to help himself the my wife 's lunch which was clearly marked with her name 
 he ran to the toilet and vomited over and over 
 apparently the moans sounded like he was dying 
 my wife just sat there innocently pretending nothing was wrong 
 needless to say she has not lost a single lunch <unk> so you know this story is not mine it belongs to <unk> in a ask reddit thread not my story 
 i while ago i was under a supervisor that was clearly incompetent 
 he was dangerous to work with completely lacked the necessary knowledge abusive to clients and very abusive to those under his supervision 
 none of us had even the slightest respect for him 
 everyone on the crew at one time or another had a major <unk> with him 
 he was known for throwing things and had nearly killed a few people due to his negligent incompetence 
 finally one day he began to scream at me over something <unk> petty and i lost my shit 
 i got in his face and told him exactly what a useless piece of shit he was 
 going so far as to say you are the reason i support abortion 
 your mother could have flushed you down the toilet and made the world a better place '' 
 not one of my <unk> moments 
 it was extremely unprofessional of me 
 i gave him my badge and told him i quit 
 find someone else to exercise your sick need to be abusive and cruel on 
 i 'm not the guy '' 
 i went out to my car called hr and let them know that i was leaving the company because i do n't come to work just to be abused 
 i care about being a good employee i want to do an excellent job and i am completely open to <unk> 
 i want to learn and take responsibility for my mistakes but i do n't deserve to be abused '' 
 the hr rep offered me administrative leave '' while they do an investigation 
 i accepted but made it clear that if my supervisor stayed that i would absolutely not be returning regardless of the circumstances 
 fortunately the supervisor above the one that i lost my shit on the person that usually put his own job on the line to protect my supervisor was on vacation 
 everyone else on the crew backed me up and ratted our supervisor out on all his extreme <unk> 
 a week and a half later i received a call from the the regional manager 
 i was informed that i could come back to work if on the upcoming monday and that my supervisor would not be returning 
 i accepted and returned to work 
 they gave me full pay for the time i was gone 
 i actually got paid for staying home looking for other jobs and playing video games 
 it was pretty sweet justice 
 i received <unk> so a letter of reprimand due to my language and inappropriate statements 
 worth 
 tldr : got paid to get my asshat manager <unk> recently graduated from college in another state 
 during that time i rented a house with 3 other girls in a primarily student neighborhood 
 we were neat responsible tenants who paid <unk> on time and took care of the house 
 but we were <unk> renters and therefore clueless about tenant law 
 the landlord was very aware of that and used it to his advantage 
 i could go on forever about what a <unk> he was but the tl dr version is that he was sexist would regularly enter the house without our permission <unk> for <unk> and then get all offensive when we questioned it did not keep his house up to city code and ignore our requests for repairs 
 <unk> he was not a nice person 
 you could have a more pleasant and productive conversation talking to a brick wall 
 we did try to get legal help from the university legal services office on a few occasions but since we already signed the lease there was not a lot that could be done 
 anyway towards the end of our lease whenever potential tenants would come tour the house we would take them aside and tell them not to sign a lease with this man 
 we sabotaged a few attempts at finding tenants that way 
 we also called the university <unk> housing office and told them to not allow him to advertise his property on campus or in the school paper because he was a crappy landlord 
 the best part was when he called me to ask why i thought nobody was interested in the house 
 i had to <unk> a smile and say i do n't know ... maybe the economy is bad '' 
 edit : added missing <unk> sure if this is where i should post this but here goes : so my girlfriend and i went to our apartment complex <unk> area and as we 're walking up we hear splashing 
 great lots of people we think so we take a look 
 well 3 guys we guessed to be about <unk> are throwing the plastic green beach chairs into the pool 
 <unk> 
 ok. you must be so cool 
 they see us and stop and start loading up their things in a backpack 
 we walk over and they go away after a minute of their scrambling and <unk> 
 i notice there are cameras pointed right at the pool at least it 's being filmed 
 they get to the outside of the fence and we see them looking with their phone flashlights in the backpack 
 they come back looking for something but we do n't know what 
 so i start looking for something anything that should n't be in the area 
 i do n't see anything and by the time they come back a third time they finally say something to us 
 they 're looking for their car key 
 ha 
 what irony 
 i get a good look at the three as their looking for their key 
 they find it and the guy that finds it says nick i 'm driving i 'm the most sober '' 
 wow 
 the whole time i 'm trying to figure out how i can get these guys 
 it 's become clear they do n't live in the complex and that they are just pulling a prank on some random complex 
 they 're also about to be driving possibly under the influence 
 my girlfriend says to them you better pull the chairs out there are cameras and i 'll be speaking with the complex manager '' 
 one of the guys gets a scared look and says oh uh ok. yeah totally '' 
 they walk away and look at it and the two guys laugh and talk him out of it 
 ok. i 'm frustrated 
 so we get ready to leave to get their license plate number 
 i get a feeling we should go out the opposite side where the main entrance is 
 we do and see a security watch 
 of all the times i 've seen a security guard this is the happiest i 've been 
 we tell him there 's 3 guys about to possibly drink and drive that threw all the chairs in the pool that look underage 
 we tell him that we 're not sure where there car is but saw where they went 
 so my girlfriend and i head to the apartment and i <unk> go around the apartments and find their car with them in it 
 bingo 
 so i run back to my girlfriend and tell her i found them 
 the security guard comes from the area they were parked asking me where they went 
 i told him what car it was and he asks what apartment were at and my girlfriend and i go back inside 
 our roommate comes home an hour later and says oh my gosh there 's like 3 cop cars over by the pool '' 
 so we tell him what happened and i go the sneaky way to where their car was 
 still there 
 best guess one was 21 and supplied the alcohol to the other s 
 either way they 're in jail 
 that was last night 
 tonight the security guard came back and asked for my name saying all 3 went to jail 
 when i asked the charges he said they were arrested for trespassing and underage drinking 
 the oldest was 17 and blew a <unk> the middle was 15 and blew a <unk> and the youngest was 14 an blew a <unk> sucks for <unk> years ago i started a job and in my department was a young lady who was just a <unk> rude crude bad tempered and nasty bitch 
 she was just a bitch 
 i am sure some of you have come across one of these people in your life 
 anyway 
 back then there was no caller id on the phones like today 
 i decided one day after hearing her yell again at someone to pick up the phone and call her 
 she sat on the other side of the office but i could hear her and see her pick up the phone 
 when she picked up the phone i quietly just hung up 
 i would turn down the volume on my <unk> and have the <unk> button on while i dialed 
 when i would hang up it was just matter of me silently clicking it off 
 when this would happen i could hear her yell dammit '' 
 over and over again 
 dammit '' 
 i would do this like 3 or four times a day 
 sometimes i would get up and go to the fax machine and dial her from there to <unk> any suspicion 
 <unk> '' 
 i would hear 
 i would suffer in silence as i tried and succeeded in <unk> my laughter 
 one day i saw the only friend i had in the office get into a fight with her 
 i just hate that bitch '' 
 he told me 
 i decided to let him in my <unk> of revenge 
 he started to do it as well 
 she would scream dammit 
 who 's doing that '' 
 and look around the room 
 my buddy and i just kept working and she could n't figure out who her <unk> in the room was 
 he would do the fax trick as well 
 when i finally quit my job i would call her like once a week and prank her three or four times in a row 
 my friend would call me and say dude was that you '' 
 she 's so pissed 
 she 's going crazy '' 
 and proceeded to tell me that she was screaming all over the place like a crazy woman and that management had been called on her various times 
 of course we would laugh about it 
 a couple of years later i get called into an office meeting and a supervisor asks me if i know a person from my previous job who was applying for a job at my current company 
 it was her and she was in the other room 
 i go to meet her and there she was a broken woman 
 she was somehow different 
 i told her if she wants a job here she can not do the same shit she pulled off in the other place and if she ever does i have the power to fire her 
 she proceeds to tell me that she had realized that she had been overbearing and that she had a real talk down by her former boss and that she had learned to control her anger 
 so believe it or not i gave the go ahead and gave her the job 
 and yes she did change 
 the people loved her at the new job and she was a productive and good <unk> years ago my husband had his identity stolen by a close friend 
 this friend '' who i 'll call lil mikey racked up tens of thousands of dollars in bills i.e 
 car apartment utilities cellphone before he was caught 
 it was a nightmare that literally took years to get straightened out 
 i 'd never even met the guy but hoped that one day i 'd get the opportunity to let him know exactly how i felt 
 lil mikey was a real tool 
 he 'd stolen the identities of and ripped off a number of other people too including his own family members friends and the mothers of his several illegitimate children 
 he 'd pulled off insurance scams by faking injuries 
 he 'd stolen money from a bunch of kids on a youth sports team he coached 
 he did some jail time moved away and had n't been seen in ages 
 until last year ... a mutual friend was shocked to see lil mikey <unk> a high school basketball game and texted a pic to us 
 it was surprising that he 'd come back to a town where he 'd screwed over so many people and even more surprising that he 'd found employment in a school district given his felony <unk> 
 around the same time another mutual friend saw lil mikey on the state 's most wanted deadbeat dads website 
 this was fate 
 i put on my nancy drew hat and got to work 
 i <unk> the photo for clues as to which teams were playing verified the date of the game tracked down organization that provided <unk> for the game and wrapped it all up with a big red bow for the state 's department of social and health services most wanted tip line 
 there is n't a nice tidy ending to this story 
 i never heard back from dshs 
 but i did hear last month that some lady '' had written a letter to lil mikey 's employer and he no longer worked there 
 and as of last week lil mikey is no longer featured on the most wanted website i 'd like to believe that dshs was able to recover back child support for the mothers of his children 
 i 'm a complete stranger to this man and i 'm sure he has no idea how this happened to him 
 it feels incredibly good to be able to extract a small measure of revenge decades later especially if this helped other innocent people he <unk> 
 i served it up cold lil mikey 
 hope you like it 
 **tl dr : karma is a bitch with a long memory 
 and us bitches be crazy 
 ** so strap yourselves in <unk> this is a story about my old opa who scared the <unk> out of an awful old and awfully old lady 
 but first a bit of weirdness - back then people did n't sue each other that much 
 which explains the lack of lawsuits in this story 
 so my aunt let 's call her mary lived in an apartment 
 her neighbours were this old couple who were incredibly petty and mean let 's call them husband and wife 
 just for disagreeing with them they started putting glue in her <unk> and throwing rotten fruit on her balcony 
 this got out of hand until mary really did n't want to be there anymore 
 most of this stuff was done by the wife 
 then my grandfather heard of it 
 oh boy 
 so first of all my grandpa is awesome 
 seriously he had pretty much every job in the world and skipped the <unk> german border three times 
 he 's clever 
 and he is a vengeful <unk> i do n't know anything about his mother 
 you see both of these awful people were really old but the husband was still working 
 my opa called the funeral director of our little town and told him he was the brother of the husband that he had recently died and that the widow would need advice for the funeral but that she did n't like to leave the house so the director would have to visit her 
 he also told him that she sometimes was a bit delusional that she did n't quite want it to be true - the director should be nice but firm with the fact that he was dead 
 now the funeral business is n't big we were a small town back then 
 so the funeral director only had one car - the <unk> 
 he rolled up in front of her door 
 the husband was working just like my grandfather had planned 
 the director in his nice official suit rang the bell and explained to the widow '' that he had come because of her dead husband 
 now contrary to what the title suggests she did n't have a heartattack 
 but darn she was hit pretty hard 
 she never ever did anything mean to my aunt again 
 not saying it was nice what he did but this is petty revenge after all 
 i first posted this in petty revenge but i was told it fit here better 
 i guess it does 
 note - i did originally post this to pettyrevenge but i was told to share it with prorevenge **background** i work in a big international company instore as a part of the warehouse operative basically we do everything for everyone 
 the manager of the warehouse team is a <unk> nice <unk> cunt 
 she employed her son full time when he turned 18 and gave him his own pick at what hours he would like 
 so now he has become her <unk> boy when she is around never but when she is not he does as he likes 
 he orders people around shouts at people and sits on his big fat ass and does nothing at all 
 **the actual <unk> so the other day after feeling bad all day i told him that if i feel this shitty i will not be coming in tomorrow and i will call his mum and tell her 
 so i carry on working the rest of the shift i think he 's cool i dont know why everyone <unk> him off 
 we are locking up and he asks me if i smoked weed 
 i said oh yeah im going to smoke some when i get home 
 we carry on talking and he admits that he smokes to 
 shift ends 
 i call in sick the following day because i feel really shitty 
 so when i return to work 2 days later i found out he told his mum that i couldnt be <unk> to work '' and i was going to lie to get the day off 
 manager pulls me aside bollocks me 
 he spreads around work i lied to get the day off 
 the same day the manager bollocks me i also get a random locker search 
 i have some items in my bag that i bought earlier instore 
 they didnt want to see the <unk> instead they <unk> through my bag saying they where looking for something in particular obviously the weed 
 so by now i know that he snitched on me to his mum twice 
 i then decided i was going to have some fun with it 
 **revenge** so then i asked him if he wanted to buy some cocaine something he said he takes all the time from me 
 i will be bringing quite a lot in tomorrow at work so he can buy 
 i <unk> that i would have about half a <unk> lol 
 so when i get to work scan in i get a call from the manager to meet me in the locker room 
 by the time i get in there three private security officers are following me from the staff room 
 then i go into the locker room there are a further 8 officers and 1 drug <unk> dog 
 i get made to open my locker and empty my bag 
 during this time the manager and her son are standing in the locker room with me <unk> 
 also the regional manager is instore so he is in there to 
 no drugs in my bag 
 store gets fined a lot of money for wasting time 
 his mum gets demoted for calling in the search he gets the sack and trys to fight me 
 he gets arrested for assault 
 he gets 7 months in prison 
 a nice added bonus to my last pay packet 
 i leave the company the next week to go to university 
 we are even 
 <unk> basically i was coming in work one day and he was waiting for me in the staff area 
 i thought nothing of it and just got changed when i was getting changed coincidentally the a security guard was just starting his shift to 
 so then when the guy saw me i was with the security guard 
 he walked up to me and basically punched me in the back of the head whilst i was walking away cheap shot 
 but it was all on camera and the security guard was a witness to it all 
 his mum got a new job after this 
 for a while i worked as a web designer in a small ad agency serving a very niche industry 
 previously the design team had no creative lead and were all sort of operating independently across varying clients 
 we decided to hire a creative director to fill that gap and i was given the task of sorting through and giving first round interviews to find the person who would later become my supervisor 
 two <unk> in particular stood out from the rest for very different reasons 
 one was <unk> talented an all around nice guy and somebody who generally would have been great for the role 
 the other let 's call him john had mediocre <unk> came across as an insufferable arrogant prick but had previous experience working within the niche industry that we serviced 
 he also had contacts within that industry that could lead to new business 
 despite my <unk> recommendation to not hire john his relationships in the industry were too <unk> to our agency 's leadership to pass up and they hired him 
 it did n't take long before the entire company started to realize john was a huge burden 
 he had virtually zero experience in anything related to digital design 
 design for apps websites mobile etc. were all completely and utterly beyond his grasp but he used his position of relative power to make decisions on those projects that the entire design team refused to support most of which came back to bite the company in the ass later 
 the design team hated him because fixing and working around his screw-ups became part of our daily routine 
 the sales team hated him because he 'd claim it took him <unk> exaggerated amounts of time to complete even the most trivial of tasks ex : 4 days to design a business card template so they would n't even assign him projects anymore 
 work that was clearly his responsibility started to rapidly <unk> down to the rest of the design team 
 we 'd be working late nights 4 out of 5 days a week because all of his projects that were in danger of missing deadlines would be <unk> to us 
 meanwhile he 'd be the first to walk out the door every day right at 5pm without fail 
 on top of all that the guy was absolutely without a doubt the biggest tool i 've ever met 
 always right about everything completely <unk> on his idiotic opinions and completely clueless that literally every person in the building wished he would get hit by a truck 
 i genuinely tried to work with him for about a year until i decided that the job had become <unk> because of him and was n't going to change any time soon so i turned in my two week notice 
 about a month after i left i heard that he had been let go from the job 
 shortly after that i noticed that he had changed his linkedin status to show that he was working for a new agency i had never heard of also servicing that same niche industry 
 i looked them up and quickly figured out that he had started his own agency ... a primarily digital agency ... when he had no experience in digital or <unk> design and had literally fucked up every <unk> project he 'd ever been on i know because most of them were <unk> to me when he proved <unk> of doing them himself 
 i looked at the portfolio on his website and found literally project after project of <unk> work 
 he was using my work from the ad agency as examples of the work his agency could produce 
 i briefly considered contacting him and requesting he remove my work from his portfolio for ethical reasons 
 but i could already hear his reply in my head 
 as creative lead all work done by my team is an extension of my creative direction '' 
 he 'd used similar lines in the past to insert himself into receiving credit on successful projects he 'd had zero involvement on 
 so instead i sent an email to one of the partners of the agency we both had worked for saying something along the lines of hey not sure if you 've noticed this but it looks like john is using your company 's intellectual property to directly compete against you ... if i had to guess i 'd assume his next step would be to make a move at your client list '' 
 the reply was short and sweet : thanks for bringing this to my attention 
 he 'll be hearing from our attorney in the morning '' 
 john 's website was brought down less than 24 hours later 
 years ago i lived in a <unk> city and became friends with a guy who owned a boat 
 he kept his boat <unk> near a popular tourist area and the garage he used was often full due to the crowds 
 as a slip owner he had a pass that would give him priority at a private garage entrance so he could skip the lines and be more certain of getting a parking spot this is not uncommon for private <unk> that offer monthly passes or passes to employees 
 also due to the crowds this garage had a computer that would count the number of cars going in and the cars going out it would not let any vehicles into the garage if there were no spots available 
 one day my friend used his pass to get into the garage knowing it was nearly full 
 after doing a full lap of all levels he realized the only remaining spot was next to an older shit-brown <unk> 
 corvette with vanity plates that had parked about a foot over the line 
 well sucks to be that guy my friend pulled his little suv in blocking the driver 's door of the <unk> 
 after all parking is scarce and this guy did n't pay for two spots 
 petty revenge 
 later that night after a day on the water he returned to find that the corvette owner apparently did n't like having his door blocked and retaliated by <unk> the side of my friend 's <unk> 
 he filed a claim lost his <unk> and got the side of his jeep repainted 
 about a year later he bought another boat and was working to restore the cabin 
 he drove into the garage as he always does and starts looking for a spot when what does he see 
 the same shit-brown corvette with the same vanity plate 
 well the heavens were certainly thinking of justice today 
 he got out of his jeep and opened the tailgate to peruse the <unk> of <unk> that were at his disposal after all he had a boat load of tools to restore his old boat 
 screwdriver 
 not much you can do with that 
 hammer 
 too cliche 
 belt <unk> 
 no power cable 
 battery powered nail gun 
 folks we have a winner 
 a few quick minutes later the <unk> body of the corvette was <unk> by nails 
 just putting nails through body panels is hardly fair to the nail gun after all nails are supposed to connect things together they must <unk> their purpose we would n't want those nails to suffer an <unk> crisis would we 
 so the doors hood boot lid <unk> headlights and even the fuel cap were all nailed shut 
 do not fuck with another man 's ride revenge will be served and it may be very cold <unk> 2nd true love : ally grew up in the tampa got married at 17 and moved to the sticks with her hs sweetheart 
 she said this made her unhappy 
 she missed her family and friends but says she tried to hang in there 
 it didn’t work out 
 it ended bitterly when she got drunk and slept with the little town’s <unk> 
 her husband found out when she threw it in his face during a fit of anger and rage 
 she left moved back home to her mom and dad and filed for divorce 
 she brought the baby now 18 months old with her 
 we met fell in <unk> and she <unk> her love 
 i was <unk> 
 she was 10 years my junior and a <unk> in the sack 
 by 17 weeks we moved in together 
 by the 19th week i was watching the kid while she was out with friends at night 
 holy crap did i screw up 
 by the 27th week i had had it 
 i knew almost instantly she was doing to me exactly what she did to her ex 
 i was <unk> up pissed and determined not to be shit on by this little bitch 
 but i’ve been around the block so i thought i’d play this one cool and see what kind of reaction i’d get 
 all of this happened in the late 70s when phones were wired to the wall and no one even dreamed of cell phones 
 i’m no <unk> so i wired a cassette player to turn on whenever the receiver was picked up and record directly from the phone line 
 within a week i had most of her secrets 
 sure enough there was another guy in the picture but she had not yet moved to full out betrayal 
 i boiled inside 
 i knew i was treating her differently but she never even noticed the change 
 god what a bitch 
 during the day i sold stereo equipment and a couple nights a week played drums with a garage band 
 most weekends we’d pick up <unk> locally or at least close enough to drive 
 after <unk> my pride i filled the band in on what was happening 
 they laughed smacking hands and exchanging $ <unk> 
 apparently they had bet on how long this one was going to last 
 assholes 
 i shouldn’t really take the credit for the revenge since it was <unk> our bass player who suggested it and the rest of the guys played <unk> roles 
 first failure sort of set the tone : on a thursday night she was <unk> out with the <unk> but i knew from the phone trace she was meeting up with mike and they we headed to the causeway beach 
 the causeway was the <unk> lane in tampa but was also know for drugs drinking etc 
 at around 10pm <unk> our lead singer called the tampa pd complaining about prostitutes on the causeway and gave them a tip about one particular van <unk> van 
 i took her kid and rode with dirt to see the show from down the beach 
 the cops showed up about <unk> shined lights in the van and pulled ally and mike out 
 i was <unk> to see them get busted 
 but damn it all to hell they must have talked their way out of it because by 11 the cops had gone and ally and mike drove off 
 almost : the next tuesday she was planning another <unk> <unk> but i didn’t get any phone info so asked dirt to follow her from my place using his girlfriends car 
 he traced them to a dance club inside a holiday inn 
 dirt called me from a <unk> and i asked him to call the club and act like he was part of vice checking for known prostitutes but before he did to have his buddy roger try to <unk> ally right in front of mike 
 <unk> ruse didn’t pan out very well since ally acted all offended 
 dirt gave the holiday inn people a description of ally and her name and within a few minutes she was escorted out 
 he heard some of the commotion because ally was cussing up a storm 
 dirt told me later that mike was kind of backing away from her and ended up going to his own van and leaving without her 
 dirt followed mike thinking they were going to meet up again but they didn’t 
 ally didn’t come home until about 2am 
 i found out the next night after listening to the phone messages that she went over her fat girlfriends place 
 i also found out mike believed she was a prostitute and didn’t want anything else to do with her 
 the finale : thursday i packed all my stuff and moved out of our apartment 
 i left without a note just moved all my shit out of there 
 called and cancelled the phone and electric 
 ignored the rent since it was paid up for the month 
 ally came home went to her fat friends house and called everywhere looking for me and finally found me at the stereo shop 
 she came in with her fat girlfriend and wanted to know why i left 
 i told her “i found out you were a prostitute and couldn’t take it so i <unk> 
 she screamed over and over in the store “i am not a prostitute 
 i swear to god 
 i <unk> god i still love thinking about that 
 last i heard she had moved to <unk> <unk> 
 i am certain she still believes that i think she was a prostitute when all she was really was a cheating whore 
 edit : corrected the time 
 fixed typos 
 i thought bass was a fish but <unk> lived up to his name 
 clarified the phone for <unk> 
 and <unk> is obviously a <unk> video lover if he ca n't figure out the cassette wiring - <unk> it 's not <unk> science dude 
 but maybe since i helped with wiring the sound for the band i know a little about this <unk> few years ago having just come out of a long term relationship i was seeing a girl who was a bit crazy let 's call her sarah 
 i also had a very long term female friend who had just broken up with her long-term bf let 's call him grant 
 whilst grant had been cheating on and <unk> my friend the two of them for some reason decided to stay friendly 
 grant had lived with her more like <unk> off her and somewhere to live now that they had broken up 
 i got a call fairly late at night asking if he could stay with me which i said yes to 
 i 'd never particularly liked grant but i figured that anything between my friend and him was none of my business and i needed someone to split the rent with 
 grant moved in and we got on relatively well 
 one evening sarah grant and i went to the pub we had a few drinks and then headed back to mine 
 grant knew that sarah and i were involved 
 fast-forward about a week and grant has borrowed my laptop and got chatting with sarah online as an msn message has popped up with her saying hello - he said that it was him not me and they chatted 
 no problems here 
 a few days later grant asks to borrow my computer one evening whilst i 'm out 
 i tell him the password joke about using <unk> mode if he 's being naughty and forget about it 
 when i get home i ask him for the computer so that i can use it in the morning 
 first thing in the morning i open the computer which had run out of battery in the middle of grant using it 
 grant had been talking to sarah on msn and the last few lines of their conversation was visible 
 it seemed somewhat inappropriate but i thought it must be innocent 
 i <unk> up to investigate and discovered that the two of them had been sending <unk> to each other culminating in a video from grant to sarah of a <unk> '' nature thankfully the <unk> had all been sent via phones so i was n't subjected to seeing any of them but i was pretty <unk> that he had arranged all of this using *my* computer 
 i was furious but said nothing 
 grant had a key to my house and owed me about <unk> in back rent which i wanted to get 
 i talked to my calm collected <unk> colleague about the situation to make sure i was n't over-reacting and he said you know what you have to do <unk> ... '' 
 i planned my revenge carefully being nice to grant the whole time ... by a strange twist of fate that very evening grant managed to break his door key in the slightly dodgy lock 
 i immediately took both keys off him and said i 'd get a new one cut the next day and not to worry about it 
 i also casually asked if he could sort out the <unk> and made up a white lie about the landlord pestering me 
 next morning grant calls out to me whilst i 'm in the shower that he 's just popping to the atm <unk> from the house to get the money he owes me 
 like a flash i 'm out of the shower dressed and grab a pack of smokes 
 i run out to the front of the house and sit outside casually smoking 
 grant returns from the <unk> pays me the rent and i offer him a lucky strike which he takes 
 i swiftly finish mine i was about halfway through when he lit up and say that i 'm going inside to put the <unk> on but could he finish smoking outside so the house does n't smell 
 i go in the door locks behind me 
 i count the money and double check i have his key 
 a minute or so later the doorbell rings and i lean out of the upstairs window and ask him loudly i was just wondering when it became ok to send videos of yourself <unk> to the girl your housemate 's seeing 
 he asks if we can talk about this <unk> and i <unk> say no if you shit on your doorstep sometimes you get shit on your shoes 
 find somewhere else to sleep tonight you 're not coming back in here 
 i ask then him if there 's anything he needs for the day then go and get him some clean work clothes his <unk> i 'm not totally heartless and a few other necessities which i bag up and pass to him out of the window 
 he has a few hours before he needs to be at work and i just leave him sitting on the wall outside whilst i go out the back exit to go to work myself 
 i tell him that he can send me a message to arrange to pick up the rest of his stuff once he 's sorted a place to live 
 he ended up staying with friends that night and collecting his stuff a few days later 
 i have no idea what happened to him afterwards 
 i never spoke to him again just cold hard cut him out 
 sarah sent me a message later that day saying that she thought i was massively over-reacting and to get in contact if i had <unk> down enough 
 i just ignored it 
 i bumped into her a year or so later she <unk> for her actions and we decided to forgive and forget 
 i helped her with some academic stuff and we parted on better terms although it 's been several years now since i 've seen her 
 all in all i was actually more upset with grant than i was with sarah although i thought it was pretty shitty behaviour all round 
 i later found out that all the time grant was with my friend he had been sending similar videos unsolicited to girls he worked with 
 revenge was sweet especially being so cold about it 
 tl dr housemate was inappropriate with <unk> i was seeing i locked him out and told him to find somewhere else to live then never spoke to him again 
 edit : added in fake names for clarity edit 2 : jesus <unk> 
 i know there is some <unk> <unk> about the <unk> of this but it was years ago the guy was a friend '' and was staying there as a favour whilst helping me cover the rent in return 
 <unk> some tenancy rights were violated if <unk> the law of <unk> and <unk> and not the <unk> the <unk> <unk> arrangement we had a actually counted as a tenancy and b could even be proved given that it would only be his word against mine years later that this even happened and just looked like he was <unk> in my spare room after breaking up with his gf as a favour as he was giving me cash but if in the extremely unlikely event that he ever tries to sue me and claim i was his landlord which would be extremely difficult to both argue and subsequently prove and which i would have no authority to be as i 'd be <unk> i 'll tell the council that he was living there undeclared which is his responsibility to do and get him screwed for council tax that he should have paid whilst he was living there which would with standard legal system interest of about 8 % <unk> over several years undoubtedly be significantly more than the amount he 'd get from me 
 edit : thanks for the gold anon 
 i 'll use my new <unk> wisely ... firstly i apparently suck at reddit formatting so apologies 
 <unk> this is probably long 
 i’ll try to divide it up and put the rest of it in the comments 
 <unk> as far as i know none of this was/is illegal at the time 
 this happened long long ago 
 someone suggested i post it on here so i’m finally getting around to doing it 
 my sister gave me permission in that i asked her and she said <unk> the fuck is reddit 
 don’t send naked pictures to <unk> so not that i was planning on it but none of <unk> are getting naked pictures 
 <unk> my sister is mental as in legit <unk> needed chronic and <unk> but a great mom 
 we come to this agreement early on in her mental health <unk> point that no matter how paranoid or awful it is she tells me everything that’s going on with her and i can give her feedback with no judgment 
 it works well 
 sometimes i tell her she’s right 
 sometimes i tell her she’s delusional 
 sometimes i tell her she’s being a dick and to knock it off 
 she’s told me everything since we were teenagers and to this day it hasn’t changed 
 she will motherfucking lie to everyone 
 and she’s a good liar don’t get me wrong but she won’t lie to me 
 because i know when she’s lying i call her out on it 
 and we move on 
 we have established this relationship because she needed a <unk> <unk> for <unk> she lost touch with reality and she knew she needed one person to trust and keep herself grounded 
 this is before we knew anything about professional psych help we were kids 
 and it still works for us so it’s all good 
 finally let me state that theirs was a marriage doomed from the start and they both did dick things to contribute to its downfall 
 this is not a story about me taking revenge over some stupid married fight or what not 
 a little background : my sister and i are very close 
 i practically raised her so i <unk> the fuck out of any threats to her happiness and safety 
 we had an awful childhood and she my brother and i survived and have close <unk> because of it but we didn’t leave it undamaged 
 my sister is <unk> polar and has these crazy paranoid and <unk> <unk> sometimes 
 she’s been on meds for a long time and for the most part they work 
 when she was 19 our <unk> died and she made a series of shitty life choices which resulted in her marrying her high school sweetheart and having 3 kids in two years one year she had twins 
 he wasn’t a bad guy they were just too fucking young 
 so about 8 years go by 
 they are <unk> years because sister is crazy bil is young and lacks intelligence <unk> but not life smart 
 let me just mention here as a note that regardless of this all they are both very good parents and the kids to this day have no idea what went down 
 and they never will as far as we are all concerned 
 bil through hard work and negligence to his wife and kids not really his fault trying to better himself and generally stupid gets a master’s in education while working full time and manages to snag a full time job teaching as a highschool science teacher 
 <unk> hoo 
 finally that bitch can start getting home on the weekends and evenings and help with the <unk> 
 life is good times 
 story of revenge : so in the year or two since bil has gotten his teaching gig at highschool her has proven himself to not only be good at his job but immensely popular with students 
 good on him 
 the world needs more good teachers 
 by my sister is unhappy 
 more and more she’s <unk> to me that she thinks bil is cheating on her 
 turns out the art teacher at the school and he have been <unk> a lot of student clubs together and what not 
 he has gotten his ear pierced and started to <unk> <unk> 
 i just let her vent 
 her marriage problems aren’t mine to solve and being a good sister i stay the shit out of them 
 things start getting <unk> 
 bil was <unk> conservative and religious 
 suddenly he is <unk> the <unk> student alliance with the art teacher 
 awesome says me 
 sister is getting more suspicious 
 tells me they keep <unk> running into art teacher when they are out with kids 
 art teacher is married to <unk> and has kids around her boys age the kids like to play together 
 this is happening over the course of a year just so you know not all of a sudden 
 my calls to my sister are getting more frantic 
 i’m thinking she needs to get her meds adjusted so she does and it <unk> her down but she’s still convinced something is going on 
 they have a lot of <unk> fights at this point they don’t argue in front of the kids 
 shit is starting to escalate 
 but being the good sister i stay out of the marriage 
 seriously they could be screwing the entire neighborhood not my problem 
 but i can tell things are escalating 
 she’s accusing him of cheating he’s calling her paranoid 
 he starts staying out later for student activities 
 this leaves no one to watch the kids so she has to start missing <unk> and doctor appointments 
 i step up and call him on it he denies everything and tells me that my sister refuses to go 
 i know this is a lie 
 i don’t call him on it i just take note 
 my sister has no family near here 
 my brother and i both live out of state and everyone else is dead or in prison cuz that’s how we roll 
 so she’s alone out there 
 he puts a <unk> on his computer and phone 
 he tells her it’s because she’s crazy and he can’t trust her to not delete his things 
 people at her church start <unk> her 
 he friends start dropping out of her life 
 she has no idea what the fuck is going on 
 i don’t because we don’t swing in the same <unk> circles i think if i stepped into a church i’d probably <unk> or something 
 she’s starting got get <unk> because of all of the weirdness 
 but i can calm her down keep her in check 
 she has no friends left at this point except for me 
 she calls me one day hysterical 
 she says bil has her convinced to go check herself into a psych ward because she’s <unk> 
 wut 
 i ask her about her delusions and she tells me about things she found on the computer that she <unk> like love letters and shit and they aren’t there now 
 outside i am calm 
 inside i am panicking 
 my sister has been crazy my whole life 
 i know when she’s having an episode 
 i can tell by her voice and language 
 she isn’t having one now but convinced of it 
 i chat with her to calm her down tell her if she thinks it’s a good idea i can’t stop her but ask if she can wait an extra week because i was flying down the next day to surprise her 
 she agrees 
 we hand up and i buy the next ticket i can get out to go see her and <unk> the situation 
 bil picks me up and starts going off about my <unk> mental break etc 
 <unk> eye rolling going on but i act concerned 
 something to note : i’ve known bil since he was 10. i can read him like a book 
 i know when he’s lying 
 he’s scared of me 
 always has been 
 he spends the entire damn week on his best <unk> being the husband and father of the year 
 i know he’s up to some shit at this point because this dude is not acting normal 
 my sister <unk> me in on the details of what’s been going on and i have to agree it sounds shady 
 growing up i studied on a pretty renowned private school in my neck of the woods 
 public schools here in this part of the world are terrible so the private school business does not <unk> to the rich like in north america it 's a requirement for even the middle class 
 of course there are the cheaper ones and the more expensive ones and the one i was in was the most expensive in the region 
 it was pretty hard for my mom to afford it but she busted her ass to be able to provide that to us 
 as the years went by the tuition kept getting more and more expensive so my mom would have to beg for a discount every year 
 bullying was getting more and more intense and the school kept turning a blind eye to it 
 the final straw happened one time i tried to correct a teacher on a grammar error and he went completely apeshit on me sent me to the director 's office and <unk> me throughout the whole year - and the school sided completely with him 
 so my mom asked me if i was ok about looking for a new school 
 this was two years before high school ended and i would have to face the big exam to get into a university which is how you get into them around here 
 she went there to give them the news and the school 's director said this to her : *well good riddance see you guys in two years when <unk> will have to come back and do some extra courses here so he 's able to get into a <unk> '' - implying that i would n't make it anywhere without the school 
 i found another school private but cheaper and studied there the remaining two years of high school 
 made <unk> friends in the process 
 studied hard and applied for a test to get into a coveted university on the most <unk> program 
 results are in ... passed 
 in **first <unk> 
 if that was n't sweet enough days later we are contacted by the school i studied last 
 they asked me if i wanted to do a commercial that would run on tv and would be plastered all over the city 
 i never talked to the previous school 's director again but i 'm pretty sure he remembered the words he told my mom when he saw my giant mug on a billboard advertising for his <unk> happened a few years ago but its memory always gives me a revenge boner 
 our family home is right in the smack of an open <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> city somewhere in the philippines 
 although our neighborhood is <unk> populated small businesses have <unk> all over since it is situated along a main <unk> heading to and fro the city center 
 among these is a <unk> karaoke bar or <unk> in the local <unk> 
 this karaoke bar was located right beside the driveway leading to our main gate our house is surrounded by tall concrete walls and <unk> by iron spikes on top which is typical in our country 
 it first started out as a small <unk> cafeteria usually <unk> to truck and utility drivers and personnel 
 things were pretty <unk> since it opened and its existence never really bothered us save for the occasional <unk> blocking our driveway a honk or two and they would be moving along 
 later however the management decided to <unk> the place into a cheap-ass open-air bar putting out tables beside the road and extended its operating hours deep into the night 
 along with the <unk> came this machine from hell 
 this is when things began to go <unk> 
 with just a few drops in the coin slot customers can now belt out standards from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and frank sinatra 
 alcohol would later up the ante at nighttime 
 a <unk> <unk> of “my <unk> is not exactly my idea for a <unk> 
 this drove my family nuts 
 although most of the time the <unk> decibel level is somewhat <unk> inside the house it’s the <unk> singing by <unk> <unk> that really got into us 
 and adding insult to injury the bar would sometimes put the karaoke on full blast when they feel like it mostly at nighttime 
 my parents first went for the <unk> approach to address the situation 
 they politely asked the owner a <unk> police officer to at least bring the sound volume down to <unk> levels especially at nighttime 
 he initially agreed and things went without a hitch for the next few weeks 
 we later noticed however that the bar had gradually increased the volume until it was back again to <unk> levels even louder than ever 
 when confronted by my mom the <unk> owner just <unk> her and said that she is being an <unk> who is trying to put him out of business the words he used in our local language is harsher but basically the same idea 
 a few nights after the confrontation the bar was hosting a gathering of a local truck <unk> association with beer flowing on the side of the road 
 that damned karaoke is blaring louder than ever 
 this coupled with singing and shouting drunkards created an atmosphere similar to a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> having an <unk> 
 this was the last straw for my dad who suddenly flipped from a relatively nice guy into a bastard coated bastard with bastard filling 
 * dad later told me he had been plotting this revenge from the time the owner insulted my mom 
 he was just waiting for the right opportunity and motivation to do it 
 * he began <unk> our home sound system a component <unk> stereo system and told me to set it up on our patio by the garden 
 he went to the <unk> and brought out two very big speakers the type which you often see at parties and other special events wired them into the sound system put on their stands and placed them at our gate 
 as if that was not enough he opened all the doors of our three cars 
 he then told me to come up with perfect song to use and save it in 4 usb’s one for the stereo system and three for all the cars 
 with the usb’s in hand he then ordered two of my siblings and i to each get into the cars and upon his signal to simultaneously press play and turn the volume at max 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> la head <unk> <unk> began blasting them out of their <unk> 
 ** * i used the original live english and 2005 versions of the song 
 the <unk> version was the most badass of them all chilling <unk> 
 it took us four tries before all sound systems became <unk> 
 * after our noise <unk> started i slowly <unk> to our gate and saw the same <unk> truck drivers who were gleefully singing moments ago now turned <unk> and constantly making <unk> looks at our direction 
 the karaoke bar owner later approached our gate and angrily demanded that we cease from whatever we are doing 
 the bumpkin even <unk> the fact that he is a police officer and can make our lives hell which on a hindsight might have caused real trouble for us 
 out of spite he attempted to <unk> one of the big speakers from its stand but was a tad too short to reach over our gate 
 my dad the big <unk> hot and <unk> just <unk> smirked and went inside the house 
 in less than an hour after our sound cannons blasted the party ended in a <unk> and some of the customers begrudgingly walked out while <unk> <unk> my sister insists she even saw two guys pelting <unk> towards our house 
 much later the karaoke was silenced and the bar closed for the night hours earlier than usual 
 the karaoke bar still continued with its shenanigans after that night albeit never going full retard with <unk> volume again at least during the evening 
 one of the female workers the owner 's <unk> i was told later verbally slandered me a few days later while i was driving out of the house 
 i was a law student when it happened so i used some legal <unk> to intimidate the <unk> instead or so i think 
 we were already planning to commence legal action when it suddenly boarded up about two months later 
 one of its waitresses who used to work for my mom told us that the bar got a bad rap among its regulars remember this place was <unk> by truck drivers because of that night word spread and caused business to slow down 
 that and some internal <unk> within the management eventually led to the <unk> ultimate demise 
 **tl dr : open-air karaoke bar next door is a noisy nuisance dad got totally pissed off one night creates his own <unk> <unk> and blasted the place out of business 
 ** **edit : changed <unk> '' to bumpkin '' 
 my <unk> <unk> often used the latter to <unk> he hate thought he said the former 
 ho <unk> 
 googled the former i do n't want to get involved in anything <unk> 
 **i had a friend key word had 
 well my friend was a proud business owner and a father of two 
 he also had a little bit of a drinking problem and decision making problem when he was drunk 
 we where both like this for awhile until i grew out of it ... he did not 
 fine his choice 
 well my friend on occasion would cheat on his wife 
 by the time he got married we were n't particularly close and i did n't care 
 how do i know he cheated on his wife 
 cause he 'd drunk text me <unk> 
 he also had another funny habit which my wife did n't think was too funny 
 he 'd post stupid shit on my facebook wall ... think sexy nudes soft core porn clothes on that 's the best way to describe it 
 i do n't know why he thought this was a good idea needless to say my wife called him up and told him he needs to stop 10 minutes later he did it again at the time i was outside working on my bike ... my phone on the kitchen table 
 my wife grabbed my phone which was ok we shared phones and begin going through our text messages between my friend and i i was the saint he was n't 
 she screen captured quite a bit of proof ... she then told my friend to apologize and stop being a douche ... he quote on quote said you ca n't fucking stop me '' i suspect he was drunk it was 11:30 am on a sunday after all she then proceeded to find his <unk> facebook page and forward her the screen <unk> of the pictures and stories of him cheating on his wife ... his wife of course was completely caught off guard ... and divorced him ... and used the evidence my wife sent her to <unk> and truly fuck him over 
 he lost his family his business his house his cars everything ... after the legal battle and paying out ... he was a broken man 
 that is how my wife destroyed a man ... all he had to do was apologize ... throwaway for obvious reasons 
 so i work in a call centre for a mobile phone provider 
 you phone me up i see every last personal bit of detail that <unk> provided with us 
 especially your phone number 
 on average i would take anywhere from 60 – 100 calls each day most of which are not pleasant 
 i understand customers feel irate they’re annoyed and upset 
 i’m okay with customer shouting at me or getting frustrated because if i was in their position i would be the exact same 
 so i do my best to help say my <unk> and forget all about you 
 only thing i can do 
 but there are some calls – some people who are truly horrible 
 scum of the earth who feel that because there is a network of sound waves between you and them that they are above you 
 better than you that you’re not even human 
 and they’re the ones i really hate 
 backstory : a month ago i receive from a call from a customer 
 before me she had spoke to an advisor who promised to waive her $ 800 bill in international charges ps : always check the website for your service provider 
 many companies have a maximum charge limited for international rates usually around $ 400 
 but they will never tell you this you need to challenge them on it 
 – right away i could smell bullshit 
 no one would promised that amount of money because they would never get the <unk> for it 
 i explained to her that i would have to raise a call listening request to see what was agreed upon 
 she came back and said <unk> no it’s okay – i recorded the <unk> to which she played the recording back to me 
 lo and behold the advisor did promise this 
 but eh whatever 
 she can’t use that recording in a court of law and we have no way of <unk> that recording so i still had to raise the request 
 i made sure to ask her if she’s recording this call she replied no 
 i made sure to warn her that if she was recording the call i was not okay with it and would have to terminate the call 
 she sternly said she wasn’t and we carried on talking 
 in the end i advised her the call listening can take <unk> working days and if she wanted a separate call-back about the issue i can raise that for her now 
 she did so both where processed both of which are handled by separate departments 
 done <unk> call over i went on lunch and swiftly forgot about her 
 two weeks later someone on my floor calls me over and says <unk> girl wants to talk to you – she said you promised to call her back and that you would credit her <unk> i looked over into the account and it’s her again 
 i explained to him what happened – he could see both requests had been made but have yet to have been picked up which happens a lot unfortunately 
 so he could do nothing else but to raise the issues again with the department and tell her that i would phone her back after 10pm we close at 9pm 
 i didn’t know he did this at the time but obviously he was trying to <unk> her off 
 this is a man who i’ve not once ever in my 2 years working here seen get slightly annoyed yet this girl had him pulling at his hair 
 i watched in awe until walking away to make sure i wasn’t caught in the <unk> 
 today i come back onto the floor after my break and someone <unk> manager walks up to me and says sternly ‘you must take this <unk> i ask why he says <unk> advisor has had this girl on hold for half an hour because she refuses to talk to anyone else 
 she says you promised this that and the other yet nothing has happened 
 she even has a recording of you promising this ’ after some bitching and trying to explain myself the manager had put his foot down and sat me down in front of the phone that was directly linked to <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> you’re speaking to op 
 how can i help you ’ <unk> the fuck have you been ’ <unk> don’t curse i’m under no obligation to take this call and i’m doing it for pure <unk> <unk> give me that – you promised me $ 800 off my bill and a call back that very day 
 it’s a month later and nothing has happened ’ <unk> very sorry to hear that but if i do recall i advised you that i would raise a call-back not one from myself 
 again i’m sorry these issues haven’t been resolved so let my try and fix it for you <unk> <unk> 
 listen to this : ’ she then proceeds to play a recording of <unk> promising her money off her bill 
 she had manipulated it poorly to make it sound like i had something i had never done 
 <unk> i do recall i specifically asked if you were recording that call 
 to which you said no 
 so you lied to me – and you have a proven history of lying and recording calls so unfortunately i’m no longer comfortable to take this call anymore 
 have a nice day.” <unk> what – you’re running away because you know i’m going to put you out of a job ’ ‘sorry ’ <unk> 
 you’re fucking <unk> her i assumed boyfriend shouts from the background ‘you better be scared 
 we have fucking proof that you lied to us 
 you guys always lie hence why we have to record these calls 
 <unk> be out on the street without a penny to your name i’ll make sure of <unk> ‘sorry but as the topic of this conversation now has little <unk> <unk> she cuts over me making “blah blah <unk> noises mocking my obviously foreign accent 
 <unk> all i hear from you <unk> “blah blah <unk> as her and her “boyfriend” laugh like a pair of elementary school bullies 
 at that point my blood was boiling so i terminated the call without another word 
 now this is where my apology comes into effect 
 this is one customer i could not forget about one customer i could not brush off my shoulder 
 i sought revenge 
 as mention before i had access to her mobile number address – heck even her favourite color 
 so i made a note of them all on a bit of scrap paper and tucked it away for later that night 
 i searched the web for every text subscription service i could find bonus points if they charged and <unk> <unk> up for it 
 i know our policy on these matters <unk> party issue customer will have to deal with the third party charging <unk> 
 so i made sure she where to receive at least 10 chargeable texts each and every day – making sure that she would rack up a phone bill with a service provider who will provide no <unk> with the payments 
 if she was going to try and <unk> me for $ 800 that could and would affect my earnings then i was to make sure she didn’t have a penny left to her name 
 now it’s too days later and i’m completely guilt ridden 
 so i’m sorry for what i’ve done i’m sorry i <unk> to your level 
 but good god do i feel good about <unk> a week for work i load and unload a <unk> truck of luggage about eight feet high for cruise ship guests at a <unk> hotel 
 the luggage i unload was loaded previously by <unk> longshoremen at a nearby dock and the luggage i load goes back to them 
 last week the luggage truck arrived completely full of luggage 
 the thing that sucked about this particular load 
 almost all of the bags were loaded with the wheels facing out making it very difficult to pull bags out of the stack to unload most bags do n't have handles at the bottom near the wheels 
 unloading took a lot longer than usual 
 i showed the driver of the truck let 's call him joel how it was all stacked as he was helping me and he had my sympathy 
 then he talked about how much he loved delivering luggage for the longshoremen because he ca n't help unload or load for them because of union rules 
 then the wheels started clicking 
 together we decided to load every piece of luggage with the wheels facing out knowing it would be harder for them it is to unload under those <unk> 
 later that day i saw joel at the office and asked how it went 
 this is what he told me : as the longshoremen opened the back door they got really pissed off when they saw the bags with wheels facing out 
 the man in charge asked me who the idiot was that loaded all of these bags 
 i quickly replied <unk> i did cause that 's how you guys loaded my truck this morning 
 i figured since you guys are the professionals that was the proper way to do it 
 he quickly turned to his workers and <unk> at them to never load luggage that way again 
 i stood off to the side the whole time smiling to myself while they unloaded the truck '' 
 i can contribute to the hell out of this 
 i was contacted by a client of mine with a problem 
 he 'd been drunk and partying with some work colleagues and things got a little out of hand 
 he ended up hooking up with someone related to the case he was working on professionally and someone stumbled across them <unk> and took some photos .. very naked very explicit <unk> 
 worse still this coming to light would have thrown the whole thing in <unk> 
 the photos ended up on one of those revenge porn sites 
 i 'm not sure whether it was his ex or someone intent on <unk> with the case but it did n't matter 
 i emailed the site hosting it and formally requested it be removed 
 the owner responded saying they do n't do <unk> requests and requested that i <unk> with myself 
 to be expected which was fine because it was step 1. i pulled the <unk> information for the site to get the name of the company he was using to operate the site then used public records to find out who he was 
 name address phone number home address then used social media to find his personal email address 
 i then used <unk> <unk> to determine the company hosting it 
 i found photos of the girl and set up fake social media accounts for her as a 16 year old girl with enough content that it would appear legit 
 i then contacted the domain registrar and his web host saying that the site contained illegal child pornography and that this served as formal documentation that i had notified them of it used an embedded <unk> transparent <unk> as proof they received it and read it and they had seven days to <unk> the domain and delete the site or i 'd be reporting them to the fbi and would be accessories after the fact to the distribution of child pornography 
 i did this on friday afternoon as both the domain registrar and web host 's phone support was only weekdays 
 the site was deleted almost immediately and the domain name suspended 45 minutes later 
 i called him on the phone using the info that i 'd pulled addressed him by name and informed him that i would 've liked to have made contact again by email but unfortunately his email was not working and neither was his web site 
 and that because of his failure to reply to a reasonable request i had taken it upon myself to have it taken down for me and that it would be in his best interests to pay attention to things i ask for in the future 
 his voice was shaking with a combination of fear and rage 
 next time you to tell someone to go fuck themselves make sure they ca n't fuck you instead '' 
 when the site finally <unk> some time the following week my client 's sexy <unk> had been removed from the site 
 i received a very nice bottle of scotch from the client and logged the work on the ticket as <unk> site maintenance 
 close enough 
 edit : thanks op for making me remember this 
 i 've added it to <unk> : as you might guess from my username my ex is a compulsive hoarder 
 if you do n't know what that is or have n't seen a & amp <unk> or <unk> us cable channels for the last few years <unk> is the inability to dispose of objects and the <unk> of objects to the point where it <unk> <unk> one 's life and the life of one 's family 
 my ex is also an alcoholic and cheated on me with 4 different guys 
 to make a long story short we have an ugly custody battle 
 i think it 's going to be a slam <unk> and it turns out not to be 
 the courts buy her i have problems but i 'm getting help '' routine 
 we end up splitting custody <unk> 
 my ex from my perspective is <unk> her nose at me and the courts 
 she shows up to pick up our kid with alcohol on her breath and her house continues to be an absolute <unk> 
 every time i send him with her i die a little inside 
 fast forward a few months : my ex has my kid for the evening 
 i fall asleep on the couch 
 i awaken to my phone <unk> me to a voicemail at roughly midnight 
 i listen to it and it 's pretty apparently a <unk> 
 i hear bar noises and my ex 's drunk voice 
 i hear a bartender say to my ex you 've been drinking for a while huh '' and she gives a slurred reply 
 i go into full on freak out mode 
 where is my 10 year old kid if she is at a bar getting loaded 
 i call the cops 
 i go to my ex 's front door knock no answer 
 i beat on the door and the cops shine their car search lights into her windows no answer 
 i text my ex asking where she is and where our kid is 
 she says she 's inside -- hah yeah right and you do n't see the lights or hear the pounding 
 eventually the cops leave as they tell me they do n't have <unk> cause to break the door down 
 15 minutes after they leave i see my ex 's car <unk> 
 as i approach the car i see her sitting there doing nothing 
 the next thing i know she puts her face into the steering wheel and passes out 
 i call the cops back 
 they return and get her out of her car 
 to <unk> the story she eventually gives them her house keys as she ca n't operate her own door lock 
 she 's arrested for dui and <unk> the welfare of children 
 the cop tells me that he does n't think the <unk> will stick but he 's willing to charge her with it and let the da sort it out 
 a couple of weeks go by my ex gets out of jail 
 i call the da handling my ex 's case and explain my situation and what 's been happening with my son 
 i plead with him that both charges need to stick as the combination of her 2 duis she 'd had one earlier that year and the endangerment charge would turn the <unk> of my custody fight 
 fast forward a few months : my ex has her meeting with the da and he plays <unk> 
 she has to plead guilty to the dui and the child endangerment charge do <unk> days in jail on the dui probation on the child endangerment charge 
 it took a while but with the help of the charges i finally won my custody case 
 i move with my son to a great suburban school and i 've been <unk> <unk> my own life and his 
 my ex sees my son every other weekend and she has to do so at her parents house as her place is still a <unk> 
 my ex is having difficulty finding work : she just lost her only job since this happened two years ago 
 she has no bank account does n't pay child support and has trouble finding jobs when employers hear of her record 
 edit : changed a few spelling and <unk> <unk> 
 also once i got my ex 's keys from her i <unk> my son from her house 
 she had left him there alone while she went out to get loaded 
 **tl dr** : ex leaves my kid alone in the house while she gets loaded 
 i have her arrested and make sure the resulting charges stick 
 her life is shit now but my kid is safe and happy 
 this post reminded me of me 
 slighty different because i destroyed my ex-wife 's relationship with her entire family 
 when i was married i tried to make it work 
 my ex will have a different story of course but my conscience is clean 
 i worked my ass off so we could get out of debt i was there for her brother and sister when stepdad would go on a <unk> and <unk> out when his <unk> got the best of him i never hit her and i never cheated on her 
 i really truly tried to make it work 
 my ex had cheated on me once before but i sincerely believe that people can change if they really want to 
 she was profusely and <unk> sorry and promised to never do it again 
 i took her apology at face value and life went on 
 i never brought it up again not even in our worst arguments 
 but having been burned i remained vigilant 
 we had moved in with her mom to help out with her family 's medical bills but moved out when those were under control and we were finally able to get ahead just a little 
 we had a little bit of disposable income and a little bit more free time for ourselves 
 four years into our marriage i noticed that she was going out '' a lot with friends '' 
 work '' was demanding more of her time 
 she was coming home later and later 
 she was skipping out on eating our meals together 
 classic signs 
 i finally confronted her 
 one day she told me she was going out with friends 
 again 
 i said it was fine 
 when her friends '' came to pick her up i told her i wanted to meet them 
 oh we have to be somewhere at this time and we 'll just make it if we leave now '' 
 i consider myself pretty laid back but i took a hard line this time 
 you 're not going anywhere until i meet them '' 
 she knows she 's caught 
 she goes out the door 
 and comes back with one guy 
 my heart rate shoots up and i try to keep my rage under control 
 my dad was an <unk> soldier and he taught us *discipline* 
 you learn discipline real fast when screwing up means you get the belt 
 i have both of them sit down she ca n't even look at me 
 i straight up ask are you her boyfriend 
 is she your girlfriend '' 
 guy has a <unk> on his face 
 what do you think '' 
 you know that saying seeing red '' 
 it 's true 
 i saw red 
 i wanted to get my <unk> and go to town 
 but *discipline* 
 you are better than they are 
 i control my breathing take a deep <unk> breath 
 my voice is shaky 
 i point to her 
 you woman if this is how you treat our marriage then i want nothing to do with you '' 
 i point to the guy 
 you 
 if she can do this to her husband guess what she 's going to do to you '' 
 i point to the door 
 both of you may now leave '' 
 the guy drops the <unk> off his face because he sees something in mine and both get up and scramble for the door 
 right before it shuts i can hear her yelling at him about how close he came to dying 
 i hear the car peel out a few seconds later 
 i lock the door and collapse down against it 
 & lt emotions <unk> & gt that night she calls me up 
 she 's getting her stuff and getting the <unk> of my life 
 i 'm still messed up so i say yes 
 i tell her i 'll even stay out while she does this 
 fine she says 
 the next day i go out and do stuff 
 then i go do more stuff just to do stuff 
 when i get home she 's taken her stuff 
 she 's also taken a shit ton 's worth of my stuff 
 stuff that was sentimental to me but not to her just to deny me that little bit more happiness 
 that 's not right that 's just rubbing it in with a rake 
 i 'm stone cold sober now and i begin to plan 
 it takes a week but end result : i take her car 
 first person i called immediately after i got home was her mom 
 i told mil that we her daughter and i could n't be together anymore '' 
 mil tries to get more information but i tell her to get it from her daughter and call me if she needs any more details 
 mil is cussing up a storm not directed at me when i hang up 
 a couple of days later i got a call from her brother who is <unk> '' and built like a brick <unk> 
 this is the guy who told me that if i ever hurt his little sister he would melt my dead body in acid so no one would ever find it 
 bro i 'm sorry about what happened 
 if you need anything just call '' 
 my mil has ten siblings 
 she told all of them and all of them were <unk> behind me 
 even the psycho aunt that nobody else in the family talked to 
 her cousins <unk> and <unk> called me up to offer support 
 it was immensely <unk> 
 karma : about a year later i heard through a friend that bf got her pregnant then dumped her 
 a year after that heard she was pregnant again from a different guy who also dumped her 
 **tl dr** - wife cheats on me 
 her family backs me not <unk> : while some details of this story may seem <unk> this is completely true gentleman 's honor 
 i have a friend whose job was to teach english in foreign countries 
 often to adults on this particular job he found himself in saudi arabia 
 he would be teaching english on land owned by a sheikh who was a wealthy community leader 
 before he had come to saudi arabia he heard that this particular sheikh had hired sixty men from <unk> for some sort of manual labor and had refused to pay them 
 the men had tolerated this for a time but eventually decided to strike nothing violent just a simple <unk> 
 however in saudi arabia <unk> is illegal so the sheikh deported all sixty men getting months of free labor in the process 
 you can imagine that my friend was on his toes when he reached <unk> 
 he had been teaching for about a month now and sure enough his payday had come and gone without being paid 
 he had visited the sheikh with his complaints but he would just wave them off saying inshallah '' 
 which means if god <unk> it '' essentially just a way to <unk> 
 after several more <unk> attempts to get his money keep in mind his paycheck was only 10,000 dollars and this man was a <unk> he was became fed up 
 he visited the sheikhs office receives the customary inshallah '' and hands him a <unk> 
 turns out my friend had paid a visit to the american embassy and told them what was going on the embassy was concerned and set up a court date 
 now this was especially bad for the sheikh who was friends with the higher-ups in the american embassy and this would severely damage his reputation 
 but my friend was n't done there 
 the sheikh was a devout muslim most people in that area were so my friend directly quotes the <unk> giving <unk> and chapter saying : <unk> the worker while the sweat is still wet upon his brow this was a major insult to the man and he practically screamed my friend out of his office threatening bloody murder 
 that was phase one the trial came and the sheikh appeared in court it was a relatively simple case and my friend got his money 
 this is where it gets interesting my friend i 've said that a lot still had some time left to teach but things were getting pretty ugly and a powerful sheikh is not an enemy you want to have so he decided to <unk> it back to the land of the free 
 the catch was that the sheikh had his passport 
 when you live on his land and are paid by him he essentially owns you and it was policy to take the persons passport and only give it back after escorting them to the airport to leave the country 
 so my friend started thinking <unk> 
 he called his wife safe in america and asked for one of the families passports 
 once he got it he visited the <unk> 's office and talked to his secretary or whatever he was the conversation went something like this 
 friend : you know you people have cheated me and lied to me and i bet you do n't even have my passport 
 secretary : of course we have your passport 
 friend : so show it to me 
 secretary : no 
 i will not show you 
 friend : thats because you do n't have it you liar 
 eventually he got to see his passport and after much <unk> managed to hold it 
 he then proceeds and i shit you not to rub it all over his body and act like he just found a long lost friend all the while trying to switch it with his daughters passport which was under his leg 
 he made the switch successfully and after having the other passport snatched back with a cry of you crazy american '' 
 left with his passport 
 victory but he was n't out of the woods yet he drove to the small house he was living in and packed everything he could into his car he even bundled up the larger items on the roof rack 
 he then hopped in and drove 1000 miles to the nearest airport 
 now comes the kicker my friend visited the closest american embassy thank goodness for those and reported a stolen passport 
 that last part had to be all caps because of the magnitude of it 
 remember he had switched passports his daughters passport was now in the sheikhs office and it had no reason to be there 
 the embassy called the sheikhs office and it went down after the <unk> embassy : do you have the passport of a jane smith 
 obviously not real name sheikh : no no we have the passport of a john smith embassy : could you just check for me real quick 
 sheikh : silence ... then muffled <unk> cursing gotcha so not only did my friend tarnish this selfish <unk> bastards name at the embassy he also framed him for the theft of a passport 
 and the punishment for theft in saudi arabia is <unk> 
 i <unk> pray your forgiveness for any <unk> errors and just to put a few minds at rest he was not <unk> disclaimer : i read this on a russian forum and i 'm translating it here 
 i have no way to verify whether this is true or not 
 but you guys liked the last story so here’s another one 
 it’s good to have an <unk> for a neighbor 
 10 years ago we got shat on 
 not a <unk> 
 a large chicken farm decided not to bother with proper disposal of chicken shit and started dumping it onto a field next to our tiny town 
 <unk> <unk> filled the air 
 <unk> of flies <unk> and <unk> 
 the <unk> could barely fly from <unk> 
 the <unk> were the size of cats and spent their nights yelling in a heavy <unk> 
 <unk> stopped <unk> and walked like pregnant women 
 nature <unk> 
 we the stinking residents of the village presented an <unk> minority and a landing zone for the flies 
 i must <unk> admit that we attempted complain to the authorities <unk> the <unk> rule of russia – if you’re shat on <unk> in it 
 stinking townsfolk called the authorities in the spring 
 the authorities finally came 
 on christmas 
 the authorities noted that there are no flies at 20 <unk> 
 and it doesn’t smell too bad 
 that means that townsfolk are <unk> and if they don’t like the smells of the country they should go to the city and not bother the chicken factory who are creating jobs and feeding people 
 i <unk> the <unk> to resort to <unk> 
 i <unk> of arson land <unk> and murder 
 my conscience won and i didn’t resort to terrorism 
 help came when it was least expected 
 the next spring a moscow banker simon divorced his wife and moved nearby to live in his country <unk> 
 the flies not having class <unk> landed on the banker and the smell wafted into his <unk> 
 simon surprised came by to my house 
 -- max he said 
 i have a question for you 
 what’s with the flies and the stink 
 and the <unk> at night 
 what’s going on 
 -- <unk> 
 -- explain yourself 
 -- nothing to explain 
 see that truck 
 -- yeah 
 -- it brings shit to the field from the chicken factory 
 a dozen times a day 
 -- how long has this been going on 
 -- since last year 
 -- those bitches 
 wan na have some fun 
 simon made a call 
 an hour or so later two <unk> of his security staff and we were in the back of his <unk> 
 the <unk> was off as it turned out not too far away 
 security stopped the next truck kicked out the driver and commandeered the vehicle 
 the <unk> started again 
 -- simon where are we going 
 -- we’re going for a visit 
 -- to whom 
 -- the chicken owner’s house 
 so we came to a neighboring town and stopped at a 4 story <unk> 
 the truck backed into the beautifully <unk> cast iron gate and dropped its shitty contents in a large <unk> pile 
 it was smelly 
 simon exited his <unk> and covering his nose with a silk <unk> approached the pile of poop 
 he dropped his <unk> white business card on top of the pile – if the owner wants to chat <unk> know where to find me 
 the very next day there were several <unk> in the fields covering the chicken shit with earth 
 okay so i am a bouncer 
 proof : username 
 tl dr dude tried to burn down the bar 
 got his ass whooped and thrown in prison 
 titties 
 some people have n't been enjoying my stories where i have to hit a guy or throw them out forcefully 
 so here 's a story that just wrapped up and it was taken into the hands of the law 
 i 've been waiting to tell this story and the ending just happened so here it is 
 a few months ago it was a regular friday night 
 i was off for the first night in a long time so i decided to get i 'm going cow tipping '' drunk 
 so as i 'm working on my goal of complete <unk> i see some of my coworkers breaking up a <unk> 
 for those that have never been a bouncer before you ca n't get out of bouncer mode once you 've been one 
 so i went to help them break up the fight 
 my coworker d-wreck has this dude in a headlock and threw him out the front door 
 the guy was yelling that he was going to whoop our ass and stuff but fuck him we know the drill 
 about 30 minutes later me and d-wreck are standing outside talking when we see the same guy inside the bar 
 the dancefloor is outside so it 's possible to hop the fence and guardrails 
 well d-wreck being very pro-violence and from alabama goes and headlocks this dude again albeit more violently 
 we tell him that he 's banned from the bar and if we ever see him on the premises again we 'll have one of the cops on duty at the bar take him to jail 
 he says we 'll regret this 
 we brush it off and wrap the first few feet of our dicks around our <unk> again 
 it 's about <unk> a.m. at this point and i 'm pretty hammered 
 low and behold we see fuckface in the bar again 
 but this time he 's got something in his hand 
 d-wreck steaming through his sweet alabama <unk> starts stomping his way 
 all of the sudden i see a small <unk> fly through the air 
 this mother fucker jumped back over the fence with a <unk> cocktail and threw it at the bar 
 luckily he hit just a corner of the bar that no one was in 
 he almost hit a few people but nobody got burned 
 d-wreck immediately <unk> the dude and <unk> him when he gets him on the ground.. imagine a more redneck edge from wwe <unk> this guy and then <unk> him that 's what it looked like 
 it was badass 
 2 of the other bouncers on duty grab fire <unk> and put the fire out before it gets too big 
 the whole thing took a total of maybe a minute 
 d-wreck has this dude with his arms behind his back and brings him to the police who take him to jail 
 d-wreck was not happy 
 this mother fucker came into his bar and tried to kill people 
 well low and behold the fire marshal called a few days later and wanted statements from everyone working that night 
 this dipshit was getting tried for arson 
 d-wreck about shit a brick in happiness 
 it was his time to get revenge on this fucker who decided to make our lives hell 
 all the bouncers on duty gave statements to the fire marshal 
 if you did n't know the fire marshal has more power than anyone 
 he can fuck you up 
 well i found out yesterday that ole fuck face got 8 years in prison 
 this motherfucker tried to burn people alive and the judge was not pleased about that 
 play with fire and you 're gon na get raped 
 in jail 
 afterwards our bosses gave us all free shots 
 i then went home caught whiskey dick and puked in my girlfriend 's bed 
 solid night.my former uncle bob was a dead beat 
 why my aunt married him is a mystery 
 he was an alcoholic and a pervert to the extreme 
 he could n't hold down a job and was a terrible father 
 not only that he was always in the trouble with the law for some reason 
 well this happened quite some time ago think 20~ years back in a small town in the middle of no where where the sheriff also had the same high regard for bob 
 well bob was renowned for peeping into bathroom windows for a bit of <unk> action 
 however one night he decided he 'd peep in on my cousin taking a shower 
 not only was this perverted wrong and illegal it was within the family 
 unfortunately for bob my other uncle tom was walking home when he spotted bob grazing through the bathroom window and he could hear the shower running so he knew bob was peeping his daughter 
 well unfortunately for bob tom is quite a large man he works construction 
 for every ounce of <unk> tom has bob lacks 
 tom grabbed bob and for the next several minutes <unk> him into submission punches to the face gut throwing around just a general quality beat down 
 of course this all speculation as the police report was quite different 
 the after math was not pretty broken nose cracked eye <unk> broken ribs and plenty of blood over both men 
 of course the sheriff who is well acquainted with bob is called in 
 the sheriff arrives a few minutes later and sees bob on the sidewalk obviously in pain and he sees tom it 's obvious there was a fight 
 so the sheriff walks up to tom and says what happened here '' tom starts to go off and the sheriff stops and says now tom it appears to me as if bob came over and tripped 
 is that what happened '' 
 to which tom responded indeed it was 
 the sheriff turned around looked at bob and said bob it appears as if you tripped and fell and i 'm going take you the hospital '' bob learned his lesson recovered was divorced and we have n't seen him since after the divorce he limped around for awhile after that thought i 'd share my tale : back in january my friend and i drive to our local <unk> 
 so we are sitting in drive-thru lane 2 waiting for our order to be taken when i feel my car inch forward 
 i did n't have on the <unk> so i thought maybe i forgot to put my foot on the brake pedal 
 crunch ... crunch what the fuck '' 
 i look behind me and some fuckass in an envoy is <unk> my bumper i drive a small <unk> <unk> 
 so i throw my car in gear and pull into a parking spot just past the lanes friend and i get out see my bumper marked up like hell and proceed towards this fucker 's truck 
 as i get closer i notice this guy 's envoy is half in the lane and half in the flower bed and i can hear the dude keep trying to drunkenly speak into the mic to order 
 i finally see the guy and my god he was massive easily <unk> <unk> 
 also he was shirtless real winner right 
 i get to his window and my buddy walks around the guy 's car for whatever reason tell ya in a second and i pull out my phone to take notes get a phone number ... *keep in mind that this asshole is insanely drunk sitting in the drive-thru lane throughout this conversation 
 i tend to approach the type <unk> as to not get my shit wrecked by a dude that has a good <unk> or so on me 
 and though i was pissed as fuck i probably would 've taken it easy on the guy had he been cooperative 
 yeah i 'm gon na need to get some information from you 
 pull up and we 'll try and work something out alright '' 
 my ... name is jason '' 
 okay my name is <unk> 
 what 's your phone number 
 do you have your insurance card or anything '' 
 ... .. '' the guy rolls up the window and drives away as i 'm like <unk> behind him screaming obscenities 
 fuck so now i 'm <unk> with a <unk> car and some dick just pulled a hit-and-run on me 
 god fucking dammit 
 end up calling the cops and one car with two officers show up about <unk> minutes later 
 i give them the <unk> on the guy 's looks kind of truck color of it etc 
 did you get a tag number '' 
 ah well shit i did n't 
 my friend hears this and comes around with his phone with a picture of jason '' 's tag <unk> 
 the second cop runs the tag number and it does n't match the envoy 
 fucking 
 great 
 <unk> 
 the cop that ran the tag just goes back to sit in the car while the other finishes up with me 
 unfortunately for me jason '' was probably long gone 
 i had a bogus tag number a pretty vague description of the guy no information besides what was probably a fake name and an envoy to go on 
 no insurance info not shit 
 so if i reported it to my insurance at this point it would 've been like i fucked my car up myself 
 great anyway the cop and i are about to finish up with the scene and he 's taking down some of my own information when the second cop gets out of the car 
 hey what was that tag number again '' 
 <unk> out tag number <unk> cop points to the drive-thru - '' son 
 of 
 a 
 bitch '' 
 the dumbass had come back like fifteen minutes later with the cops and myself still there to the drive-thru for his burger 
 cops acted quick pulled him outta the truck searched him and the truck and put him in cuffs 
 truck was towed 
 jason '' scored a minor in possession hit-and-run whatever the charge is for having a bogus tag and a dui charge 
 his parents were nice enough to pay me some cash for my car which i gladly accepted and finished paying my car off and i decided not to press any further 
 the state is gon na have a lot of fun with him so why should i bother 
 i owe a lot to my friend for being so proactive in <unk> the scene 
 he 's received plenty of beers for the act since 
 and the cop said i was the <unk> dude he 'd ever seen 
 i 'd agree 
 kids if you 're in a <unk> take pictures of that shit 
 hope you enjoyed 
 sorry i 'm a shitty <unk> 
 creative writing was never my <unk> story just came recently in from my friend in korea 
 he started working at a consulting firm which specialized in helping foreign businesses enter the korean market 
 they also claimed to be <unk> at seo 
 when he told me about this job i googled the company 
 what i found shocking was if i typed the name of the company into google it was several pages until i found there website 
 i thought to myself ... how the fuck does a company who says they are marketing genius unable to make their website shows up on the first page of a google search for their name 
 also they had offered my friend a very high salary of $ 8,000 per month which was unusual and very high 
 and i asked my friend to dig into this company and see whats up 
 i left it there well my friend did n't 
 he did some digging and discovered that the company was funneling money from the korean army from into his bank account then <unk> 
 my friend thought to himself i really need this $ 8,000 so i 'll stick around '' my friend did n't particularly care that this company was breaking the law 
 he just wanted his money 
 but in the mean time he did some digging and found some proof 
 guy was basically funneling <unk> a month through this company 
 his employees where just a front 
 then came payday ... and guess who did n't get paid 
 my buddy 
 he approached his boss and basically said pay me '' guy kept beating around the bush 
 my friend set a deadline 10 days after payday he was to be paid or he was going report this company he did n't threaten the last part and come the 11th day he contacted a government agency <unk> in fraud investigations he walked into their office and dropped off all the evidence and proof he had 
 which was substantial 
 everything from receipts to emails etc he had everything 
 long story short my buddy former boss went to prison 
 he was ordered to pay back all the money he had stolen 
 and guess who stole it 
 his business partner who they have n't be able to locate they suspect he went to china and now not only does he have a prison sentence 
 he also has a judgement of about $ 1.5 million dollars from the korean government ... korea still has <unk> <unk> 
 my friend confided in me his game plan was to get that $ 8,000 and then quit and forget this company ever existed 
 just some added info it was a company of 4 people * ceo * hot <unk> who apparently the ceo was banging * 2 senior marketing executives one of them was my buddy heres the thing ... those 2 senior executives '' one of whom was my friend ... did n't have any marketing experience or education 
 one of them did n't even speak korean 
 you need to read them <unk> as well figured you all might enjoy 
 before you wonder maybe she was going slow in the fast lane or maybe she was driving like an idiot 
 i was going 65 in a 60 in the right hand slow lane 
 i had gotten over after passing another vehicle to let the cars coming up behind me pass with out having to slow down 
 i am a considerate driver 
 my low profile lp friend was on the end of line of the cars coming up on me when i got over 
 he wanted to pass them on the right without knowing i was there 
 i suppose that was my fault along with the cars to the <unk> left of me slowing down to my speed due to a cop coming from the opposite direction 
 anywho for about 2 miles extreme tailgating persisted 
 our group of 6 cars got clogged up in <unk> and other traffic 
 3 of the cars turned off in various directions leaving 3. we get up to a good stretch and back up to speed 
 at this point the guy next to me the original truck in front of him had had enough of him <unk> between the two lanes tailgating either one of us 
 he would speed up to pass me lp would jump behind him and he would slow down 
 i did remain at a consistent 65 mph so lp would jump behind <unk> etc 
 i noticed the board in the road 
 it was sitting perpendicular across the lanes about 1/4 in the left lane and 3/4 s in my lane 
 i had about 10 seconds to <unk> to be a jackass or not be a jackass 
 i decided on the <unk> former 
 i waited till the last possible second 
 <unk> my suv right just as he was going back to the left lane to harass the truck 
 bam he hits it 
 i heard it 
 a satisfactory smile crept across my lips and my truck friend realized what i had done 
 he sped up with lp right on his ass 
 lp rolls down his window <unk> me off pulls out in front of me brake checks and speeds off 
 i was expecting all this 
 a quarter mile down the road his flashers go on and he pulls over to the <unk> with a flat tire 
 i slowed as i went by him rolled down my window smiled and waved 
 tl dr : traffic can be frustrating 
 if you drive like a jackass people will treat you as such 
 edit : had to change a right to a left 
 see strike <unk> this happened over the course of several years 
 <unk> i played golf for a university and was <unk> enough to have a scholarship that paid for me to go to school 
 back in the summer of 2004 i was arrested for a dui 
 i blew <unk> when the legal limit is <unk> bac 
 i didn’t know any <unk> where i lived went out of state for school but i had a very dear friend that thought he could help me out 
 i was referred to a guy i will call tom name changed 
 i paid tom $ 1500 dollars to handle my dui and he said that was the friends and family discount and i figured i would be in good hands 
 a couple months later being an idiot kid i say kid even though i was 23 at the time i got pulled over again and was driving on a suspended license 
 car impounded ticket etc 
 my coach was not pleased and i was removed from the team 
 to this day i do not blame my coach 
 he made the right decision 
 i ended up having to leave school and move home as i could not afford to stay without my scholarship 
 the above is important because tom being the attorney of record got all of my notices to appear in court and was required to appear on my behalf since i no longer lived in the state 
 over the next couple of years i found out on three or four occasions that i had a bench warrant for my arrest for failure to appear in court 
 i knew nothing about having to appear due to the fact that i was not receiving any of the notices and tom was not showing up to get my simple dui taken care of 
 another year passed and the dui was still not settled 
 i was moving on with my life and had finally got a good job working as a <unk> for a national company life was looking up and i was enjoying the work 
 after about a month at the new job my supervisor pulls me into the conference room and informs me that the company had run its mandatory background check and asks me why there was a bench warrant out for my arrest in another state 
 i inform him of the dui for those that may ask in the application it asked if i had been convicted of any <unk> technically the dui was not settled and a first dui is rarely ever considered a felony 
 and he tells me that due to their insurance company not being willing to cover me i would be let go and that day would be my last day 
 i was defeated 
 it had taken me months to get that job and get out of waiting tables 
 i called tom to see what the absolute fuck was going on with my case and how i had yet another bench warrant out for my arrest 
 he <unk> my calls for days 
 i started keeping call logs on when i called if i was able to reach him etc 
 but it was to no avail 
 he basically disappeared 
 the <unk> i started looking into what it would take to file a complaint with the state bar association 
 this is not a simple process and you have to be able to prove the attorney was negligent in how they were handling your case 
 fortunately my mother was a <unk> records <unk> for matters like this and had the call records for the last several months along with the minimal documentation contracts etc from when we hired tom 
 we filled out what seemed like an endless supply of forms for the complaint and sent everything we had to the state bar association 
 it took several months but once the bar association looked into the case they wrote to inform me that they had suspended <unk> license from practicing law for 10 years in that state and he would not be able to appeal it for 5 years 
 they also refunded me the $ 1500 that i had paid him which went to hiring a new attorney 
 the new attorney was great and was able to get the matter resolved within 6 months 
 but she did tell me that when she appeared before the judge he was visibly upset at me due to how tom had handled the case 
 i was not given any leniency and got maximum fine amounts and 3 years unsupervised probation 
 all totaled it took almost 4 years to get my dui case settled in court 
 my probation has been over and done with for a while but i still smile knowing that tom is still unable to work in his primary profession 
 and for those wondering i do still drink but when i do i drink <unk> and take a cab 
 tl : dr don’t do your job which results in getting me fired from mine 
 i will make sure you cant work in your profession for 10 years 
 i 've debated if this counts as pro revenge since i literally did n't have to do anything but i think it 'll still fall under the category 
 i 've mentioned in a past post do n't wish bad on other 's wish good on yourself '' 
 this is a prime example 
 after college the recession had started up and jobs were severely limited 
 i ended up taking an entry level call center job for retirement plans which is quite possibly the worst hell you can imagine 
 i was talking to 80 yr old women during the stock market <unk> and had to tell them what happened to their life savings 
 it was heart shattering 
 you also experience the worst of the <unk> toilet and that 's where this one caller i 'll name big mac '' falls in 
 i was called at 9 am by an older man who demanded to speak with my friend who was a manager in training 
 my friend was n't going to be in until <unk> am so i told him and offered to either transfer to his voicemail take a message and email him personally or transfer him to whatever manager was available 
 ill call my friend bob big mac : you 're not <unk> 
 * i 'm <unk> <unk> to transfer me to bob right now 
 me : ... i understand you want to talk to bob but he does n't get in for another half hour 
 it 's literally physically impossible to transfer you 
 big mac or bm did n't comprehend this 
 stating it was absurd that he was on vacation in florida he lived i think in jersey and he had to call and could n't talk to bob and just kept bitching in general 
 i offered numerous times to help him myself or any of the other options i gave him earlier 
 he became more irate bm : now you listen to me 
 you make <unk> bob calls me before he has his first cup of coffee 
 *do you understand me 
 * me : ok. staying calm i mentally checked out on this dude after the 3rd time explaining bob was n't there bm : now listen *very* closely 
 if bob does n't call me when he gets in i 'm going to my local mcdonald 's and shooting up the place and i 'm going to blame *your <unk> <unk> me : sir <unk> we 're on a recorded line i really ask you *not* to joke about murder bm : you have no idea how serious i am at the exact moment i spoke ... bob was walking by me 
 me : ok. we hung up within 20 seconds 
 me : i really hope i never have to deal with a dude like that again here 's where the wish comes into play bob : that guy sounded pleasant 
 now ... what 's this about joking about murder '' 
 i told him and within 20 minutes they called bm 's local police and arrested him in jersey 
 calling from florida huh 
 the police later told me when they arrested bm he was yelling that he was going to sue the cops his town and state my company and most of all *me* for slander 
 he continued to yell and deny until he was sat down in the police station and was played the phone call 
 the cops tell me bm immediately burst into tears and begged for forgiveness and that he did n't mean it 
 this was immediately 5 minutes after he maintained his <unk> on denying <unk> and suing everyone 
 i ended up talking to bm once more two weeks later 
 much more <unk> than before and ended the call by telling me how much he appreciated my service he recognized my name and voice and knew i was the same guy 
 like i said do n't wish bad on others wish good on yourself 
 if a wish comes true one helps you more than the other 
 plus karma 's a <unk> 've heard this story from a few sources 
 it seems though that over the years the number of people that claim that they were actually in the truck at the time '' have increased to circus clown car proportions 
 when i asked him about it mark not his real name said he was driving his pickup full of friends in a grocery store parking lot when a car abruptly backs out forcing him to stop short 
 then after <unk> along for about 10 s a man <unk> the store yells out hey angela 
 how are you '' 
 this lady proceeds then to actually stop her car exit the vehicle and leave her car door open blocking both lanes of the parking lot now to go visit with her friend 
 after about 5 steps mark yells out hey angela 
 how about you come back here and move your car '' 
 she turns around and asks how do you know my name '' 
 he replies i just heard that guy yell it over there 
 now how about moving your car '' 
 a vehicle has also pulled up behind him so he ca n't even back out now 
 she goes oh fuck you you asshole '' then walks over to her friend and begins chatting with him 
 my friend <unk> for a moment and then guns his truck right through her driver side door ripping it off it 's <unk> 
 he yelled fuck you too angela '' 
 as he peeled out of the parking lot 
 **tl : dr** lady blocks parking lot with her open car door 
 friend drives through said door like a crazy person 
 english is not my first language 
 ignore the grammar issues please **tl dr version 
 ** was very good friends with boss and female <unk> 
 they had an affair together and took my honesty and friendship and respect and shoved it in my face 
 i got back by waiting a full year and <unk> them out to their <unk> causing them to get divorced 
 <unk> of text version : ** so a few years ago i worked at a fortune 100 company 
 i was there on a contract 
 everything was great 
 really liked the team boss paul was great 
 he and i could talk about anything honestly as two guys 
 he 's been to my house 
 i 've been to his 
 his wife is funny and a stay-at-home mom 
 if it wasn’t for the <unk> thing we could be bros outside of work 
 at some point there is a new woman contractor mary that starts on the team 
 she sits in the cube next to me 
 she 's married pretty hot a little bit flirty just generally great too talk to 
 she and i hit it off right away 
 we become pretty close texting each other at night about work and family and just general shit 
 every now and then she throws some random comments out there about me coming over to her place 
 which from a self-esteem point of view was just a big plus in my book 
 never took her up on it but could have 
 we have our normal <unk> about how to run stuff complete tasks etc 
 and while those got heated it was just two strong <unk> people having <unk> opinions 
 no big deal 
 she becomes a family friend 
 our kids play together families go to events together etc 
 fast forward to about 4 months later i am chatting with my boss late at night project <unk> he mentions that he is jealous how mary and i can <unk> and clear the air and just move <unk> 
 i thank him for the compliment and did n't think anything of it 
 well within a couple of weeks <unk> and mary are doing lunch together constantly 
 i ask him if i should move out of the way '' as it is obvious that he likes her 
 remember i am there on a contract so my boss can fire me without a reason – that why i treated him with <unk> he says no 
 life goes on for another couple of weeks this way 
 then he puts her on his pet project 
 all of her time is now allocated to his stuff 
 he does n't have time for the rest of the team as all of his attention is focused on his project '' i am sure you can see where this is heading 
 it was quite obvious to the entire group that they were having an affair 
 the entire group was up in arms about this because this new '' girl is getting all of the <unk> attention getting <unk> etc 
 same old story that you have heard about before 
 needless to say i too am upset 
 i am losing my bff 
 i figured we were friends enough to keep being friends even through her affair 
 obviously not 
 what bugged me about the entire thing is that i told my boss who was also a friend that his affair with her was ruining my work relationship and my personal relationship with mary 
 he denied to my face that they were having an affair 
 which was such bs because i overheard him talking to her on the phone saying how he wanted to come over to her place for one of their <unk> <unk> and make out with her 
 side note : there were also a couple of photos of them that were taken by people on the team - one was taken in the office at a group celebration for someone’s birthday in the background you can see them in his office with his hands on her ass and another one where the team was out to a concert everyone was drinking 
 people finally noticed that they disappeared 
 one of the women in the group took a pic of them kissing in his car of course i did n't tell them about these pictures during our talk 
 fuck him and her 
 less than a month later we do a shuffling of cube locations to better <unk> the people who work on projects together '' 
 i am moved to a <unk> <unk> - no one around me 
 handwriting is on the wall 
 one month after that i am cc 'd on an email to my contracting firm informing them that my last day will be 2 weeks from that email 
 so through this whole thing my friend '' just quit hanging out and i get why 
 did n't give a shit anymore 
 pretty much just dumped me as a friend 
 i didn’t like it 
 i tried to ask her why to see if she would say anything at all -- no dice 
 her allegiance was to paul now 
 i told her that i was upset 
 she told me she did n't care and didn’t have time for me 
 fuck it 
 if you want to have an affair go for it 
 the whole affair part did n't bother me too much 
 i will admit to some <unk> there but i am not going to sacrifice everything i have for some ass 
 just not worth it to me 
 what bothered me was the lack of respect that they both showed me 
 i was pretty honest with both of them about what the team was saying how everyone was feeling etc 
 what they did was take my honesty and use it so that they could cover up their affair better 
 for example when i said that people were noticing that she would leave and then paul would get his coat on and leave within 5 min he started leaving his coat in the office and leaving about 15 min after her 
 when i said that people noticed that he was giving gifts to her and not to the group then all of a sudden the group started getting stuff too 
 crap like that 
 what was funny in a fucked up way is that about 4 months after i was gone she started being friendly again random how are you 
 my day sucked '' texts 
 anyway i moved on <unk> 
 still texted her every few days after she started texting me 
 again nothing major 
 just pleasantries 
 i <unk> the ups and downs of our friendship to being rich '' then being poor '' 
 i would much rather be rich '' again 
 who does n't right 
 but that anger was still inside me because of how vulnerable i made myself to her and how i felt i was used 
 so i resolved to get even 
 i waited a full year and heard that she had accepted a full time position with my former boss 
 i then sent an anonymous email to his wife letting her know about the affair and giving her details and the proof the pictures too 
 mary of course called me so did my former boss 
 he was pissed 
 i told both of them that i did not do anything how could i i have been gone for more than a year 
 i do n't know anything about your life anymore ” fuckers 
 i heard that both of them got tossed out of their homes and are getting divorced 
 they deserve each other 
 moral of the story if you are going to have an affair be <unk> and keep your friends close 
 or have the balls to say i do n't want to be friends anymore '' and not be a passive-aggressive douchebag 
 because if not they may become your enemy and might be even more passive-aggressive and look for revenge 
 did it make me feel better that i did it 
 fuck yes 
 i 'll be around if you have questions 
 this is a throwaway account so feel free to ask or <unk> or whatever 
 did n't know this sub existed so cross posting now 
 this began approximately 3 weeks ago and culminated last saturday 
 two of my friends from college now stay close and live in the same city 
 since we graduated we all stayed close by hanging out drinking and most of all by pulling pranks on each other 
 it started as rather innocuous <unk> changing out someone 's entire apartment <unk> with ugly <unk> <unk> store moving each others cars while we were at work etc ... of course a sort of <unk> came into play with the pranks becoming more elaborate and slightly <unk> the two of them hired a <unk> to <unk> hit on me at a bar we frequent and then payed her to <unk> me for a week 
 it always made for good laughs most of the time 
 at this point i should introduce the two <unk> bastards i call friends 
 <unk> as we shall call him is from a well off family and kind of a dick and <unk> is a bit more reserved and busts his ass working at the county <unk> 
 i only give the background on them because it is sort of <unk> to what happened 
 leading up to a few months ago gérard started becoming a little too aggressive with pulling one over on edmond to the point where it was <unk> obvious that things were getting a little too mean <unk> 
 we talked about it a few times and gérard always just played it off like it was no big deal 
 however the pranks continued and just the generally verbal <unk> he gave edmond was just too much for the guy to take 
 after work one day edmond and i are drinking <unk> at my house and he tells me that he is sick of gérard 's shit 
 he then lays out his devious plan to put him in his place 
 i realizing the amazing crown <unk> that he has plotted agree to assist 
 a few weeks later the three of us are at the bar and this beautiful blonde comes over and starts falling all over gérard 
 unbeknownst to him it is actually a cousin of edmond who had been enlisted to the plot 
 she eggs on to drink vigorously until the bar kicks all of us out 
 we already planning to stay with at gérard 's place due to his close <unk> to that part of town get back and keep him drinking 
 at this point the poor fellow is <unk> drunk and it does n't take long for him to pass out with his head in the toilet 
 collectively we move the victim into his bed and get to work 
 edmond and his cousin begin applying makeup to her 
 first they take her down to her underwear and then apply a very pale <unk> to her entire body 
 she takes on a very <unk> appearance before edmond places a fake neck wound from a costume store on her neck 
 next edmond bring in a cooler with several <unk> of real fucking blood 
 at this point i did n't even want to know the how 's or <unk> but i kept rolling with it 
 after a few hours of waiting around all of our nerves frayed from waiting by his door hoping he did not wake up and throw a <unk> into out plans we laid the finishing touches 
 edmond 's cousin crept into gérard 's room and played in his bed 
 edmond then cut open the blood bags and covered gérard the girl and a kitchen knife from gérard 's kitchen of course 
 at this point the sunrise had fully <unk> the room when i left and edmond stayed behind 
 suddenly i hear edmond cry out gérard 
 what the hell have you done 
 an audible <unk> could be heard from the bedroom as the still drunk gérard started out of his slumber followed by a stream of expletives from the newly faux murderer 
 i rush into the room on cue to release my own stream of expletives and to grab gérard no reason to give him too much time to contemplate the situation 
 i usher him into the living room and sit him down to calm him down 
 right now would have been the perfect time to end this <unk> and make it a story we could all have laughed about however edmond was not done with his prey 
 he comes out of the bedroom to tell gérard that the girl is dead 
 the hysterics coming from our <unk> are endless 
 edmond <unk> down to eye level and slaps him across the face and tells him to get it together because he is going to have to call the police 
 gérard reacts to this by freaking out and begging the two of us not to do that 
 masterfully edmond pretends to deeply contemplate the poor man 's <unk> and then says i can take care of this for you but you have to commit to it 
 never say a word about this to anyone 
 ever '' 
 i on cue again escort gérard to the shower take his clothes and tell him to clean all <unk> of blood from himself 
 edmond and i then go inside of the bedroom and wrap his cousin into a <unk> 
 as we hear gérard exit the shower we pick up the girl and carry her to the bed of my pickup truck with a cover outside 
 when he sees us carrying the mass of cloth and body he freaks out into hysterics again 
 i we spend the rest of the morning cutting up carpet moving the mattress and <unk> walls and floors 
 all the while stopping to console our terrified friend 
 at many a point we could have stopped and revealed our ruse to gérard and perhaps we should have 
 however edmond was not yet done with him 
 the following weeks were not good for gérard 
 the three of us hung out still but no longer did we go out and the would be murderer constantly checked the news for a missing person or a body turning up somewhere 
 he once pressed edmond for details of what we did with the evidence only to be met with a stern its better if you did n't know '' 
 fast forward to last saturday evening with the three of us sitting in gérard 's living room 
 he begun coming out of his state of shock and would talk to us more about the normal things we guys bullshit about on a regular night 
 coincidentally it was also the night that edmond <unk> his final stroke 
 after finishing a beer gérard stood up and turned to get another from the kitchen other end of the house where a pair of glass doors lead out to the back deck 
 standing on the deck was none other than edmond 's cousin in her blood <unk> <unk> with a cheap faux neck wound staring back at him 
 instantly the haunted victim began pointing and screaming to which edmond and i started <unk> laughing 
 gérard was too <unk> in his fear to notice our reaction for several minutes as he continued his hysterical response <unk> up on the floor 
 at this point the game was finished 
 we let the would be <unk> into the house and explained the masterfully laid prank on our friend 
 instantly the fear turned to rage and he threatened to kill us as he ran the three of us out of his house 
 neither edmond or i have been able to get gérard to talk to us since 
 tl dr we made our friend think he killed someone and then haunted him with his perceived victim notes : i do not know the origin of the blood 
 i do know from my experience growing up on a farm that the blood passed the cursory <unk> test 
 i do not go into detail about why <unk> '' deserves this mostly because i do not have edmond '' consent for that 
 it does cross work and family <unk> that we all had until recently <unk> army <unk> i was in advanced training where you go after basic training to learn your actual job and there was a problem individual '' in our barracks bay room of 20 beds 
 he was being discharged for failure to <unk> '' and was <unk> it as long as possible to milk the pay he was getting from the army which he kept referring to as the easiest job he 's ever had '' 
 the bay had 10 bunk beds and one single bed he got the single bed because nobody wanted to be near him 
 he did stuff like the following * walked around claiming to be black clearly not to groups of black soldiers because his adopted mother is black 
 * used nigger '' as a greeting to black soldiers while flashing what he probably thought were gang signs but looked like he was having a seizure 
 * walked around with his laptop on his shoulder playing rap music from it like it was a <unk> <unk> 
 * talked loudly in his sleep mostly creepy sex stuff including the names of specific soldiers in the bay 
 * <unk> bragged about how he could kick everyone 's ass but screamed for the drill sergeant like a child crying for mommy if anyone got physical with him 
 all that crap we could ignore because he was on his way out and we thus had no responsibility to try to help him improve but one thing he would n't do was secure his locker 
 he 'd always leave it unlocked and the whole bay would get punished for having an unsecured locker 
 he 'd also throw a raging fit if you closed his lock when he was n't around because you touched his stuff '' 
 as such we never referred to him by name he was simply the douchebag '' 
 i was one of the <unk> '' soldiers so the drill sergeants would pull me off of the work details to do paperwork for them 
 i did n't mind trading 3 hours of gardening in the sun for 4 hours of paperwork in an air <unk> office i probably would have done better in the air force than i did in the army 
 while doing paperwork i overheard that there was going to be a full locker dump inspection the next morning 
 that night i went to the little convenience store across from the barracks and made an unusually large purchase from the <unk> aisle 
 the next morning the drill sergeants storm through the barracks room by room dumping the contents of everyone 's lockers to check for <unk> 
 mine is dumped of course no problems 
 my <unk> 's is dumped no problems 
 then it 's time for the douchebag 's locker 
 at first it 's trash 
 he was too lazy to actually throw his trash away so he just threw it on top of his other stuff 
 candy wrappers you 're not supposed to eat in the barracks empty tiny bottles of alcohol drinking not allowed in training dirty clothes so nasty the drill sergeant kept rubbing his hand on his pants after touching them 
 with each infraction the drill sergeant gets <unk> and louder but the douchebag knows that if they try to give him serious punishment that he 'll be there even longer 
 the drill sergeant then grabs the backpack hanging on the locker door pulls it open and turns it over on the bed 
 out spill a <unk> douches half of them new in their box and half of them out of the box with their contents emptied 
 the drill sergeant stops yelling mid-sentence and just stares 
 the douchebag is confused until he picks one up of the packages and reads what it is 
 he <unk> 
 he 's screaming that they 're not his he 's throwing the bottles at other soldiers who are at parade rest waiting for their locker inspection ripping the sheets off his bed and he 's even kicking his own stuff on the floor 
 the drill sergeant just watches as he <unk> stomps on the stuff on the floor in his <unk> up until the moment he realizes he just brought his foot down through his laptop 
 then his rage turns to despair as he <unk> this laptop like it 's a dying child crying and screaming in full meltdown 
 the drill sergeant watches for about another minute then loudly says carry on '' and exits the bay 
 and no he did n't start <unk> his locker after <unk> a throwaway for this had to get it off my chest to someone after so many <unk> where do i even <unk> my parents were immigrants from <unk> 
 dad was a physicist he passed away when i was 5 my brother 2 and since then mom <unk> to earn for our living it was rough 
 before that mom was a housewife taking care of us full time so she had no big education or work experience 
 so she turned to cleaning cooking and babysitting for our neighbors in the community 
 after some time we could n't afford to pay rent on time and that 's when i realized that we are in trouble because the landlord was coming and shouting at my mother she was crying it happened several times 
 i helped as much as a kid can i guess but that was not enough to keep us fed & amp bring money 
 after several angry visits the landlord came with a friend they were both drunk and they beat up mom and forced her to have sex saying that they will harm me and my little brother 
 it was the most terrifying moment of my life mom was hysterical and crying and did n't stand up for the rest of the day we were crying with her and did n't understand what and why had happened 
 the landlord said he will come back after a week 
 he did that for over a year coming back once or twice a week alone or with his friend 
 they did n't shout or beat mom up any more and they locked me and my brother in the toilet so that we did n't see anything but mom was crying very long after each time they came 
 mom was starting to get crazy then she was talking to herself and crying several times during the <unk> some time passed like this and the landlord began staying overnight mom acted really crazy she would beg him to stay in the morning made him breakfast and <unk> and gradually he was living with us my mother treated him like dad and i had to pretend that i like him because every time he did n't like my behavior he would make mom shout and cry at night 
 my brother does n't remember our dad at all so our stepfather likes him more than me 
 anyway back to the point to make this whole mess even more rough our stepfather has seizures sometimes especially when he 's drinking and does n't take his medicine or <unk> the tablets it happens <unk> during those times he is unconscious for like 3 minutes and dancing all over the floor anyway he does n't remember anything 
 so when i was 9 years old i had so much hate for him boiling in me that i was planning ways to kill him before going to sleep 
 but i was afraid of doing anything like that which would destroy our family even <unk> so i was secretly <unk> of harming him and this was especially strong when he was drunk or unconscious 
 i remember this like it happened <unk> he came back home drunk late at night we were all pretending that we are sleeping to avoid trouble although he was very loud and stumbling & amp banging on everything 
 at nights like this we were just silently hoping that he would collapse and sleep and do no harm 
 and he did 
 after waiting the safe amount of time i was able to go to the toilet to pee which was <unk> in times when he was not drunk enough me and my brother peed into empty soda bottles to avoid going to the toilet 
 so when i went to the toilet to pee i saw him there he was on the floor lying in his vomit with pants down and having a seizure i was <unk> i thought he was sleeping with mom 
 but instead of waking mom up i took a needle which he always used for picking his teeth and i stabbed him in the balls 
 i dipped the needle in his vomit and stabbed his balls for more than 2 minutes i made sure that his vomit got into his balls 
 after that i put the needle back on the sink and went back to sleep feeling excitement and relief 
 of course he did n't remember anything the next day but he was very very angry and <unk> and accused mom that she hit him in the balls when she was <unk> him to bed in the morning 
 he stayed in being very pissed 
 after i came back from school i found out that the friend drove him to the hospital 
 well it turned out he got <unk> <unk> <unk> & amp came back from the hospital several weeks later without balls and lacking a big chunk of meat around the area 
 those weeks were the best weeks of my life 
 also he stopped drinking after this but he never stopped being an abusive asshole until he died when i was <unk> never told anyone not even my brother 
 **edit : ** first of all thank you for not judging for what i did 
 i have had enough mental problems when i was a kid i thought that i was a monster for what i did 
 fortunately the situation got much better when our stepfather came back from the hospital he stopped drinking was less aggressive and did n't disappear for days and come back beating us and mom 
 this helped me a lot to justify what i did but again i was not aware of the possible consequences when <unk> my spontaneous revenge 
 i wanted to give him pain and a swollen sack while he barely made it alive from what the doctors were saying 
 the doctors never told him about the needle marks i think because of the <unk> - i never got to see it but the friend driving him to the hospital told us that it looked like a <unk> the size of a <unk> he died of unrelated reasons when i was 24 - after he stopped drinking food became his new addiction and he got really obese quickly 
 he had a fatal stroke 
 as for his friend i never wanted revenge on him because when our stepfather disappeared sometimes for days long he came to us gave mom food and money he helped us to get through the rough times 
 i always thought that he was the good guy at least in comparison to our stepfather 
 as for myself i am doing fine thank you for asking 
 i am happily married my wife also was a victim of childhood abuse so we understand each other on a level impossible for <unk> 
 out of fear for <unk> the past my wife and i made the decision to <unk> did that last year so no children possible for us and that 's fine 
 i often wonder how would my life go if my father had n't died 
 i 'd probably be a physicist or something 
 i 'm working shifts 
 but now that all is fine i think i can better appreciate this small fine life i have with my wife 
 all good stepfather burn in <unk> a throwaway for this 
 it’s long so i hope it’s at least entertaining for you all ... i work in it for a large company 
 a year ago we were a bit short staffed so we finally picked up a new coworker we’ll call him chad 
 when i saw chad’s resume there were a few red flags for example he had close to 10 different jobs in the past 5 years 
 for the first few days everyone was ok with him but after a few shifts we noticed a <unk> he would constantly browse gaming sites go home for lunch so he could play with his games which was fine since it’s his lunch break anyway and after coming back from break he would have his ipad with him so that he can watch <unk> after business hours we work 12 hour shifts and the <unk> is pretty dead around <unk> 
 he was a pure video game <unk> 
 don’t get me wrong i am ok with people slacking off but i at least want them to learn how to do their job first so that they can be of help when needed 
 for the first 3 months my team tried our best to train him but he was way more focused on gaming than actually learning the job he never <unk> anything we taught him because he just wasn’t interested 
 my team kept telling our manager about his lack of progress but our manager just <unk> it up to us doing a horrible job of training him 
 when chad was 8 months into the job he still didn’t know how to do the basics that most people already pick up by the first week and our manager still refused to fire him most assumed that he didn’t have the balls to pull the trigger on it 
 at that point our team was already so fed up with chad that we just ignored him and gave up training him 
 our team is 24/7 so we cover for holidays but the company only wants 2 staff members max for holiday shifts because they don’t want to pay too much overtime 
 when the next holiday shift was coming up i volunteered for it with another coworker i love the overtime pay and plus i didn’t want chad to work it because if something did blow up he would be useless i worked holidays alone with chad before and i did all the work really frustrating 
 this didn’t sit well with chad though and he brought it up to me 
 he told me it wasn’t fair that i was working more holidays than him and he wanted to work this next one he also brought it up to my manager and i was pretty much forced to let him have it 
 i saw the smug look on his face as he <unk> in his <unk> but deep down that was the last straw for me 
 i didn’t believe that this guy deserved to get overtime pay for a shift that i know he won’t be lifting a finger for so i felt like i had to get my revenge 
 i started browsing his facebook page to try to dig up dirt on this guy and turns out his fb was a <unk> 
 the guy always complained about work and made his status updates public so that i could see it without even being his friend 
 here are a few that i found : once i found these i forwarded screenshots to my coworkers and that eventually reached my manager 
 this woke my manager up and he was finally on a mission to get chad fired 
 the only tricky part was that chad’s facebook name was fake and he had no pictures of himself in his profile the only reason i knew it was his facebook was because i always saw him on it during work 
 my manager decided to take a stab anyway and had a 1 on 1 meeting with chad and showed him the facebook page and asked him if it was his as we <unk> chad denied it all 
 after that meeting my manager gave me the update that we don’t have enough evidence to fire him 
 i was so close to getting him that i didn’t want to let this bastard slip through 
 i searched his fb even more found his <unk> fb page and sure enough her pictures were also public and it had quite a few pictures of chad tagged with his fb profile 
 nailed him 
 my manager brought up the pictures and chad had no choice but to admit it was him 
 he even had the balls to say to my manager “the only reason i lied about my fb page the first time was because i wanted to protect you my manager just incase this would bring trouble from <unk> 
 he was fired on the spot 
 felt so good 
 **the aftermath** my manager still had to deal with chad a few times via e-mail afterwards 
 apparently after chad got fired he sent an e-mail to my <unk> boss saying how my manager made my team gather the evidence so that chad can get fired before he moves to the <unk> we didn’t even know he was moving to the usa <unk> he always said how he hated that country so it was a surprise to us 
 he also sent an e-mail to my manager about how he found out he has cancer and since he doesn’t have a job he can’t afford the medical bills for it 
 not sure if chad was just lying about that to make my manager feel bad but i would n't put it past him 
 bonus picture here is a status of him complaining about other people’s laziness when he himself is the laziest bastard i have ever worked with : **tl dr useless coworker forced me to step down from working for overtime pay i dug up dirt from his fb to get his ass fired 
 **so my now ex girlfriend <unk> of us are <unk> cheated on me with a 32 year old married man who she works with 
 after nearly three years she goes and does this to me right before final exams in college 
 i nearly failed out of college and then she texts me and says btw he 's a better <unk> than you '' and goes on to mention how they fool around on work time 
 so i wanted revenge 
 i went to where she works and asked some of my friends that work there and found out the guy 's name 
 so i called the walmart spoke to the manager and in complete detail *that she gave <unk> described what they were doing on work time and when he asked me to come down and show proof i showed him the texts she sent me 
 they were making out she was blowing him etc on the clock so he thanks me for letting him know and i leave 
 later i go on her facebook and see her status saying how she got fired 
 i checked at the walmart and found out the guy got fired too 
 you cheat on me after three years 
 you 'll lose your job and your reputation will go down 
 i am considering exposing how much of a whore she is to her friends as well 
 suck on that you lying slut 
 edit : and stop asking for the <unk> pics 
 look up porn like everyone <unk> grandfather owned a rather large farm in a small farming community 
 he always got along well with the neighbors that is until jim moved in 
 jim was someone that my grandfather had known from his time on a nearby police force 
 jim had approached him and asked him to sell a small parcel of land to build a house on 
 it was an inconvenience as my grandfather owned the land on three sides of this but he grandfather accepted and jim started to build 
 fast forward a few years my father and grandfather continually found garbage dumped on their land 
 later that summer they also caught jim digging a duck blind in the middle of their field 
 that was the beginning of the end for the relationship 
 after several attempts of my grandfather being civil and jim continuing to dump garbage things were getting worse 
 it all came to an end one day when my father was driving through the field in a new <unk> and drove it right into another duck blind that jim had dug 
 now my <unk> farm was n't just for growing plants 
 he also had a few hundred pigs and a few thousand <unk> 
 he picked my father up in the field and drove to the manure at the back of the farm 
 i 'm not sure how many of you are familiar with a liquid manure spreader but they have the ability to coat anything and everything within a 40 <unk> behind the unit with a very thick and very smelly coating of shit 
 well my grandfather loaded the spreader 3/4 full then just to make sure it stuck in place broke a few <unk> of hay into the spreader 
 he proceeded to back the tractor and spreader up to the property line at jim 's back yard and let loose 
 by the time he was done he had done this on all three sides of jim 's property and left a four inch thick coating of shit cemented in place with the hay around the entire property 
 it was that bad that jim had to pack up and lived at a <unk> for the entire summer 
 eventually he moved and had to sell the land back to my grandfather at a fraction of what he bought it for 
 tl dr was a duck blind worth four inches of cemented shit i used to live in a tiny studio apartment in a really shitty neighborhood with very thin walls and stupid neighbors 
 one of them had a girl over every now and then and he made her presence known to all 
 he had his bed against the wall my bed was against 
 every time she was there his headboard would repeatedly smack against my wall 
 worse this dude had some serious <unk> so my boyfriend and i had to listen to this for hours 
 when i approached my neighbor about this he said there were pillows behind the headboard so that could n't be him 
 he offered to show me and sure enough he did have pillows stuffed behind the headboard 
 they were on the floor 
 the top of the headboard was hitting our shared wall not the part bolted to his bed frame 
 he insisted this was enough and that would be the end of it 
 now i 'm not going to pester my property manager over my <unk> neighbor but i 'm not going to start a band and use his headboard for <unk> either 
 this had to stop but how ... a while later i was watching a video on youtube where someone had dubbed <unk> <unk> over horrible things to make them funny 
 the boyfriend saw this and asked why do n't we use this on the neighbor '' 
 that man was a genius 
 so we <unk> up the stereo with a copy of the <unk> hill theme set the volume as high as it would go and turned it off 
 armed and ready 
 sure enough as we start falling asleep he starts up 
 fire the first round 
 we blast the music 
 he stops 
 we turn it off and enjoy the silence 
 he did n't get the hint 
 he started up again louder and more aggressive <unk> than before 
 fire the cannons 
 this time around we were laughing hysterically 
 the boyfriend called it the <unk> of their love '' 
 that musical cold shower ended all our problems 
 the nearby apartments were really pissed until they heard the story 
 it <unk> though the entire building 
 that neighbor never brought another woman <unk> this happened sometime ago when i was riding shotgun driving with my dad down a throughway 
 it was a 2 lane throughway that has a speed limit of 65 mph 
 my dad was going about 72 mph and would go into the left lane to pass slower cars then he would get back into the right lane 
 we come up to this truck that is either doing the speed limit or going slightly over so my dad pulls into the left lane again to pass and then right when we are about neck and neck with this truck this woman in a big ol suv comes like a bat out of hell and is behind my dad 
 she starts honking the horn and you can tell she is losing her shit being behind my dad 
 i think what made my father mad was how all of a sudden this woman was going off the deep end tailgating flashing her brights honking the horn 
 what i found weird was my dad decided to just match the speed of the truck next to him 
 the revenge he stayed at the same speed as this truck for about a mile or two this lady going bat shit the entire time 
 i asked my dad why he was doing this and why he did n't just pass the truck and let this woman be on her way and out of her life 
 he looked at me and said son it is not ok for people to act like that '' 
 now at this point there is a long line of cars in the left lane behind my dad he slows down a little as if to have the truck on the right pass him 
 as soon as this crazy lady see this she switches lanes my dad speeds up and takes a whole train full of cars with him as everyone passes this lady who is now stuck in the right lane 
 not the best revenge story but it was just cool how calm my dad was and made that lady learn a little <unk> i have no idea if this story is true or not 
 it was told to me by a girlfriend i had years ago 
 either way it makes for a good story 
 she used to live in a town where in the fall people would rake their leaves into a big pile on tuesdays and then on wednesday morning a big truck would come around and suck the leaves up and take them away 
 some dumbass local teens had taken to driving around town on tuesday nights and driving through the <unk> piles spreading them everywhere and making a big mess 
 after having it happen to her a few times she apparently took matters into her own hands 
 she <unk> up all the leaves one tuesday and then placed a few cinder blocks into the pile so they could not be seen 
 sure enough at some point later that night she could hear their car and <unk> driving up the street into the <unk> piles and when they got to her pile she heard a loud bang and someone yell what the fuck 
 she peeked out her window to see one of the teens getting out and inspecting the damage before screaming to his buddies about the fact that his dad would kill him for the damage to the car which apparently belonged to his dad ... after which he got in the car and drove off slowly 
 she found bits of <unk> in the leaves the next day 
 oh and apparently it never happened <unk> this is better for petty revenge just let me know and i will move it but i thought it was better here 
 this was years ago when i was a supervisor at a grocery store and as you know people love to park in the fire lane for who knows what reason i am guess entitlement or lazy 
 for our store this <unk> a few problems 
 one it was getting in the way of us bringing in carts from outside and two is that we had a drive thru for our pharmacy and people where getting in the way of that too i even had a car park in the drive thru but that is a different less satisfying story 
 there are signs saying this is a fire lane and do n't park there 
 ok time for the story 
 one day i was checking our cart situation when a car pulls into our fire lane and gets very close to our doors 
 this is bad because i do n't want our cart guys accidentally hitting his car when they bring carts in ... and you know the whole illegal part 
 i see him get out and come in through the door i am standing by 
 i ask him please do n't park your car there it is in the fire lane '' 
 his response was to stare at me and just continue walking 
 ok fine i gave you a chance 
 i inform my coworker working the service counter to call the police and inform them someone has parked in a fire lane 
 i inform the manager as well and i have told him the authorities have already been called 
 it takes 10 min 
 for the police to show up 
 the officer pulls up behind the car and my cart person comes and grabs me to tell me the police have shown up 
 as i am walking out the door guess who shows up 
 that 's right the driver and he sees the police car right behind his and the officer less than 10 ft away that i was walking out to talk to 
 so what is his response now that this is happening 
 his response and i am directly quoting <unk> ass bitch '' 
 i am not happy about but i say nothing 
 believe me i wanted to say something 
 i head back in and inform the manager what just <unk> when in comes the officer 
 he would like to speak to me alone 
 i really had no idea what was wrong or if i was in trouble 
 did i do something wrong by wasting his time or some other thing 
 well it turns out that the officer heard his comment and was planning on giving him a disorderly conduct ticket for his language 
 i want to say also for him parking in the fire lane but i fail to see how that relates to traffic 
 he asks me if this is ok i <unk> this for a moment because i do n't want to head to court if i have to testify or some such thing but then the words he said pop back into my head and i agree to give him the ticket 
 here is the kicker the officer continues to inform me that he ca n't do anything about the kid in the car but he said he will inform the driver that he will mention this in his log and it will be seen by social services 
 i was not expecting that 
 i look over at the window to see the car and sure enough there is a kid about 6 or 7 in the back seat now jumping up and down 
 my only guess is that the kid was asleep when i first saw the car 
 holy crap that far out <unk> the parking in a fire lane or the car getting hit by carts 
 one of the customers later came up to me to thank me for calling the police because she saw that kid was left alone in the car i told her i did n't know but i would have called if i had seen that as well pets too 
 the officer leaves and i go back to work and relieve my service counter worker to go on break 
 less than 5 minutes later the driver walks in and walks by the service counter and gives me the death stare 
 all i could think was i just wanted you to park your car in a normal spot '' 
 crap and now thinking back on that he still did n't have his kid i should have call the police again <unk> <unk> got some pa <unk> horns to battle my neighbors dog after being rudely awoken way too early for a few weeks in a row 
 well i decided to record my neighbors dog during one of these sessions 
 i then went ahead and got four speaker horns from craigslist and set them up pointed towards my neighbors house 
 i then played the recording of my neighbors dog barking for them one early morning for about an hour 
 have not heard the dog since 
 he is still there but somehow the neighbors magically seems to have a better handle on the barking 
 not sure if this belongs here but i 'll try : wanted to post this early but had a crazy end of the month 
 so i run a fairly large dealer network as many of you know and because of this i have quite a bit of capital at my disposal 
 well i 've been in this business since i was 18 i 've been around the block more than a couple of times 
 i’ve also been ripped off before and know how to protect my business 
 i’m no <unk> so don’t try and pull a fast one on me 
 i also believe that a man word is as solid and <unk> as a written contract ... at least it was when i started 
 well one day i get a phone call its henry 
 henry is a smart bright intelligent young man from a fairly successful family 
 heck henry used to work for me 
 before his family decided to invest in him and buy his own dealership that 's all well and good ... good for your henry 
 well henry calls me up and after a bit of small <unk> chat henry says that he has an excellent deal for me and would like for me to purchase a large quantity of his stock 
 i however am a bit <unk> on used vehicles at that moment and politely said i 'm not all that interested in buying any more stock henry then confided into me he got himself in some sort of <unk> problem and needed an influx of cash to pay out a settlement or his dealership would get foreclosed on 
 now i felt bad for henry he explained more in detail on how he got in trouble and now had to pay the price 
 well he had about a 70 vehicles in stock and wanted to make about $ <unk> in cash and was willing to part when some pretty good vehicles at very solid <unk> pricing 
 well fine let’s see what he has 
 finding <unk> vehicles at a good price is always hard and helping out a fellow dealership is always a good thing 
 i told henry i 'd stop on by and check out what he has on the lot so i did i found in total about 20 vehicles in which i wanted to purchase for my used car inventory and i advised henry of this 
 we came to an agreement those 20 specific vehicles for $ <unk> giving henry more than enough capital to take care of his problem plus some extra cash on top 
 honestly the deal was n't that great of a bargain for me but hey i was n't going lose on this one 
 i also felt really good about giving henry a helping hand 
 we agreed he said he needed to prep them and i 'd pay for the transport back to my dealership 
 i however insisted on i would pay once the vehicles were delivered and not before 
 he was actually a bit <unk> at this <unk> i then reminded him that the cash was not a problem and he knew this so he <unk> 
 all is well and done and a few days later we start the transfer and when everything is said and done my used car mgr calls me up and tells me henry only sent 17 over 
 when the truck driver who knew i had purchased 20 vehicles had brought this to henry attention he said i knew what was going on and everything was ok '' well everything was not ok and a $ <unk> car deal is not a small deal and i am most certainly going be checking in on this ... now i figured henry sold 3 of the 20 vehicles to customers ... that 's ok we will just lower our agreed upon purchase price i take his 17 and we are done 
 so i called up henry 
 i expected the phone call to be pretty simple hey henry i got 17 vehicles we need to agree to a new price let me just <unk> what those 3 vehicles where worth and i 'll wire that over '' keep in mind we did n't have a contract saying i 'll pay x for y '' but i did have a list of vin numbers 
 henry <unk> at this said we had agreed on those 17 vehicles for $ <unk> i balked right back and said he 's being unreasonable ... i was very upset at this point cause this man was honestly trying to pull such a stupid fast one on me 
 i then told henry deal is off you can come and pick up your vehicles '' well of course he was having cash problems and it costs money to transport 17 vehicles so those 17 vehicles sat in my back lot for awhile 
 when eventually his dealership went bankrupt and everything went up for auction 
 i hoped on over and bought out his entire stock for a fraction of what it was worth 
 it was quite a significant <unk> for us and our sales people where more than happy to sell them 
 now the story is n't over just yet ... there is one more nail to be hammered in this coffin 
 my owner bought a dealership several months after this fiasco 
 i of course was in charge of this dealer as i was all the dealers in this owner’s network 
 so here i am inside the dealership getting a feel for this place when henry walks in i was in a back office henry approached a sales person asked for a manager and told the manager he was an experienced sales person looking for a sales persons job 
 of course henry did very well in the interview with the sales manager and the manager called me up advised he had a great hire and wanted me to give a quick once over 
 i said to bring him on in there i am sitting in my office when their is a knock on my door i say come in manager walks in first and starts to introduce henry when henry walks in right behind him and we lock eyes ... you all of a sudden see this poor man soul get crushed henry excuses himself and runs off to go to the bathroom '' the manager is quite confused and i simply say nice find but i bet you he ai n't coming back '' i 've not seen henry since 
 o and henry made my sales staff very happy not sure if you guys know how the business works however my sales staff is paid 25 % on the profit of a vehicle 
 they get a 5 % bump at 12 and another 5 % bump at 15. well we got his entire stock of <unk> vehicles for a rock bottom price so lets say normally we pay say $ <unk> for this truck and sell it for $ <unk> with a $ 750 pack sales person makes $ <unk> however if we got that truck for $ 12,000 sales person now makes $ <unk> or as much as $ <unk> so those 70 vehicles went through our dealer network very fast 
 we had quite a few sales person have zip code pay days because of henry 
 i posted this over on a <unk> secret thread and someone thought you guys would like it here 
 not all that dark but i 've never told anyone my revenge story 
 when i was 10 years old my mom sent me to a summer camp in another county 
 i knew 2 other people there and we were placed in the same cabin 
 the other cabin was full of the locals who had been there previous years 
 i was a fat awkward kid and i got picked on all the time 
 this camp was no exception but there was this one kid who was <unk> 
 we 'll call him sam 
 sam was always pushing me around calling me names constantly 
 i would n't even eat if he was still in the lunch area 
 one day we were in our cabin talking about how mean the other guys were and i decided to seek revenge 
 i had to take a massive shit so i grabbed this plastic grocery bag and filled it up 
 i took the bag to the other cabin while the other kids were out being cool 
 i found sams bunk grabbed a pair of his underwear and shoved them down in the bag 
 after <unk> it up again i put it under sams mattress with a little bit of it hanging out 
 by the way the stench was <unk> 
 relieved i had n't been caught i ran out of there and back to our cabin 
 when the bullies came back in from playing we could hear their disgust 
 it did n't take long for sam to be the new target of endless bullying 
 nobody wanted anything to do with the kid that shit himself 
 guess who did n't get picked on for the rest of camp so due to a comment i made in a <unk> <unk> i 'm here to elaborate 
 background : i <unk> was 25 at the time i moved from the east coast to the middle of nowhere 
 i had made what i thought was a great friend in a younger girl <unk> on campus 
 she reminded me of myself and on top of it she was incredibly intelligent and a joy to be around 
 she was unsure had low self-esteem was an <unk> due to a really fucked up childhood 
 i really did everything i could to include her in everything down to holidays with my family and worked on building trust 
 she deserved it 
 we got along so well and she started to come out of her shell and really blossomed 
 we moved in together 
 around this time i was admittedly dumb young naive and got into a relationship with a <unk> twice divorced because he seemed like the most interesting and tolerable human in the area other than my roomie 
 it should be noted that his first wife was a close friend of his hs girlfriend his second wife was a close friend of his first wife 
 obvious pattern - not saying i was smart 
 the two of them over the course of a year hung out maybe 3 times at bars 
 they very rarely even talked to each other 
 in fact he was an asshole and had little to no interest or so id thought in meeting any of my friends 
 she was gone for the summer for an academic pursuit and when she came back i decided to cook a dinner for her and my so as i wanted them to be friends i wanted to be able to hang out with the both of them 
 we picked his place because it had the bigger kitchen 
 side note : roomie had her first kiss as a drunken dare on her academic trip 
 she had never been hit on let alone anything else 
 in the midst of cooking i realized i needed a couple things to finish dinner put them in charge of keeping stuff from burning while i darted out for <unk> minutes 
 came back ... found so and roomie banging 
 needless to say i was devastated and maybe went a little nuts 
 and vodka became my bff i lost a lot of weight 
 i kicked roomie out of the apartment and threw all her shit on the lawn that night 
 she moved in with him 
 my friends back home tried to make me feel better by checking out the hysterical '' personal ads and casual encounters on craigslist 
 bad idea 
 i found several ads he had posted he had a very unique and <unk> writing style 
 and they stretched back at least 3 months 
 rather than <unk> further in despair my friends back home drew up the game plan using pics provided by a friend of mine we created a google number and all had access to text from 
 so i took the chance and replied to one of the postings 
 he was obviously oblivious 
 he also hated talking on the phone 
 so i guess that 's called <unk> 
 and we talked '' for three weeks he travels for work and set up a date 
 for the date i picked a local bar in town with a front and back patio told all my friends to tell their friends and packed nearly the entire place with team <unk> 
 the folks who we did n't know were soon in on the act 
 the friends he would recognize were on the back porch with me 
 i had a friend of mine serve under a cover story as <unk> <unk> contact 
 when we got the text he was there i walked out with the friends that were hanging out back with me 
 and i confronted him told him he was a piece of shit he was and how he should never do what he did to me and his <unk> ever again and took a bow to a standing <unk> 
 i texted my former roomie as he left told her what i did and apologized for the condition he would be coming home in 
 i felt as if she was manipulated and told her i never had any hard feelings against her really and that i understood if she was going to hate me after that 
 i never spoke to either of them again 
 and despite the small size of the town i never saw him again after that 
 i moved away back to <unk> a year and a half ago 
 i dont regret what i did 
 i still feel bad about my former roomie 
 that piece of shit though ... i hope he never dates another woman 
 **tl dr : my so banged my virgin roomie i kicked her out <unk> him from a craigslist casual encounter ad and humiliated him in a packed bar 
 not sorry 
 ** ** evidence literally <unk> out of my old ass external <unk> other edit **i am more ashamed of dating this <unk> <unk> now than i was then 
 what an awful piece of shit 
 <unk> replied in a petty revenge thread about cheating & amp thought my cheating story belonged here 
 my mom 's first year teaching included this class of seniors 
 they were a bunch punks who made her cry with some not so nice pranks like putting deer urine in her air conditioner and crazy gluing the lock in her classroom door 
 <unk> are two of the big things i remember that really upset her 
 my revenge consisted of selling them a fake answer key which made them fail their test 
 they of course were upset so they started blocking their cell phone numbers before calling me during lunch & amp leaving death threat voicemails 
 unfortunately for them my dad is an agent with the fbi in our small home town 
 after letting him know what was happening with the voicemails he got pretty concerned 
 he does n't play around with that kind of stuff so he immediately got a ~~warrant~~ court order that day from a judge issued to the cell phone carriers involved to obtain the account information 
 after contacting the account <unk> parents and figuring out what was going on he had them meet him at the school while the officer assigned to our campus pulled those seniors out of class in cuffs 
 he was initially pretty concerned which is what prompted him to get the ~~warrant~~ court order issued but he did n't want to screw over these kids by pressing charges 
 instead he just put the fear of god into them & amp explained how serious the situation could have been 
 nobody messed with my mom or i after that 
 ~~my mom 's teaching included this class of seniors 
 they were a bunch punks who made her <unk> putting deer urine in her air conditioner and crazy gluing the lock in her classroom door were the two big things i can <unk> ~~my revenge consisted of selling them a fake answer key which made them fail their test 
 they of course were upset so they started blocking their number and calling me during lunch to leave death threat voicemails 
 unfortunately for them my fbi agent dad does n't play around with that kinda stuff & amp got a warrant that day from a judge to then get their info from their carriers 
 before school was over he had the school 's police officer pull them out of class in <unk> ~~my dad pretty much just put the fear of god into them without having to say much at all 
 nobody messed with my mom or i after <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : i feel like i should add once he found out the people calling were the dumb kids involved '' 
 before the warrant got the carriers to release who was involved he was pretty concerned 
 after that he was just pissed <unk> edit3 : i suck at telling stories so i tried harder edit 4 : it was a court order not a warrant 
 basis was domestic terrorism '' i used to work for a company that was terrible about promising the moon and then dropping the responsibility for delivering it squarely on me 
 they promised customers hardware features that nobody in the industry offered 
 then they 'd dump it in my lap and say make it happen '' 
 then the salesman who sold it would scream bloody murder over things taking twice as long to install than they <unk> for 
 when you sell people things that do n't exist yet do n't be surprised when it takes a tad longer than the handy spreadsheet corporate sent you says it will take 
 it really ate into their commission so some of them wised up and would consult me before bidding a job with anything weird 
 one guy just never got the message 
 he did it over and over again without so much as a thank you '' for bailing him out 
 i did my job and i took pride in it but one day he had the <unk> to complain to our parent company about my open disdain for their lack of quality 
 it was no surprise to them as i was always ranting to their quality control people over stupid crap that they shipped out 
 i 'm talking about receiving stuff with half the components falling off the board because that half of the board had n't been <unk> properly 
 other things would come in with parts missing or the motor running <unk> etc 
 of course all of them had quality control <unk> on them claiming that they had passed some inspection or other 
 so far as i could tell the only way some of them would have passed even a visual inspection would have been if they were using satellite <unk> 
 on most jobs 4 out of 10 devices failed on initial power up 
 of the remaining 6 more than half would fail in the first year of operation 
 i 'm a bit of a <unk> when it comes to my work and this always upset and embarrassed me 
 the conversation started over him trying to blame me for the number of warranty claims 
 he insisted that i must not be <unk> things properly 
 <unk> every branch of the company was having the same trouble 
 i do admit to going on a bit of a tirade but i was beyond fed up at this point and did n't really care whether i got fired or not 
 i take pride in my work 
 turd polishing is not something i signed up for nor do i tolerate it quietly 
 especially when the company hasn’t given anyone a decent raise in almost five years 
 mr. <unk> <unk> had just sold another real science project that involved field modifying our equipment to add a feature that it was never intended to have 
 meanwhile 6 different companies had equipment that had to be <unk> into playing nice with our stuff and each other 
 of course on jobs like that the final connections and making everything work together always gets overlooked when contracts are drawn up 
 you always end up with everyone arguing that they are n't responsible and trying to push it off onto everyone else 
 it quickly <unk> up the chain of command 
 well this time was no different 
 when i called to get him involved he texted me back saying he did n't have time to deal with it '' 
 he was heading out for a 3 week vacation starting that friday and had more important things to do 
 in the end all i could get out of him was i do n't care how you do it just make it happen 
 normally i 'd have pushed the issue but for once i did n't 
 i <unk> did what i was told and made it happen '' 
 i never once <unk> off but let me tell you after a month of 70 hour work weeks those jobs had some of the best documentation and the <unk> wiring <unk> i 've ever made 
 nobody had to argue about a thing 
 every time another company <unk> their <unk> of work off on me i made it happen '' and documented my time meticulously 
 i even took the progress photo 's he was supposed to submit and submitted them 
 he never saw a dime of that commission 
 120 hours of overtime that you failed to budget for will kinda do that 
 edit : forgot to include the tl dr tl dr salesman drops a huge job for equipment that does n't exist in my lap right before going on a 3 week vacation 
 his only instructions were make it happen '' 
 well ... i made it happen by working so much overtime that my labor ate up his entire months commission 
 so i got to claim 120 hours of overtime and he did n't get paid that month 
 i used to keep a bottle or sriracha in the fridge at my last job 
 i even went as far as to write on the bottle that anyone could use it just please return it 
 about a week in my bottle of sriracha goes missing 
 the next bottle i put in the fridge i wrote do not touch '' on as someone had already abused the <unk> of having public domain hot sauce 
 a week or two later this bottle too goes missing 
 at this point i 'm heated from my lack of delicious sriracha so i go out and buy two bottles instead of one 
 the first i put in my <unk> so only i could use it 
 the second i dumped the top inch of sriracha out of and replaced it with 4 million <unk> hot sauce 
 i do n't know who stole the third bottle but i know that they were probably shitting blood as just the <unk> left on my hands after washing them 3-4 times was enough to make me gasp for air when i accidentally touched my finger to my mouth 
 poor bastard 
 a couple years ago i was in graduate school living with my gf and our <unk> old 
 we lived in a cheaper '' area of town due to my fantastic grad student salary ... it was not a dangerous area ... <unk> kinda cramped 
 we lived in a <unk> apartment complex and had 3 other neighbors with a shared <unk> area 
 for the first few weeks everything was great relatively quiet and had lots of room for low rent $ <unk> for a <unk> 
 until one of our neighbors started seeing a douchebag 
 we noticed that someone would regularly show up at about 2am with their bass <unk> way up and would just chill in the parking lot while his <unk> got ready 
 normally it does n't bother me if it was for a short period but he would sit for like 30 mins and sometimes he would n't even be in the car but leave his music blaring with his windows down 
 so i decided to ask him to turn it down while in the parking lot as he has been waking our daughter and a cranky child is not fun to deal with all day long 
 he usually did but only for that visit the next night it would be right back to the same volume like he had the memory of a <unk> 
 fast forward a couple weeks of this and than i notice he starts parking right in front of the walkway during the day 
 now to the average person it is clear this is not really a spot but rather a gap in the parking spaces with no parking block and with orange lines on either side to allow residents to go to and from the building without having to squeeze between cars 
 it is also smaller than the other spots but can still barely fit a vehicle 
 now keep in mind this is a pretty small parking lot with many extra spaces ... .so its not like you save that much time or effort parking there compared to even the <unk> spot 
 anyway he starts parking there 100 % of the time and just starts irritating my wife and i due to the fact that it can be a tight squeeze with a car seat or with our dogs 
 not to mention that this is not an spot to begin with 
 my solution is to park in the adjacent spot over the line so there is not enough room for his <unk> <unk> <unk> to fit 
 his response 
 he parks behind my car in the middle of the parking lot thinking he can block me in 
 well he does and the next morning i have an important 7 am meeting and lo and behold i am blocked 
 thankfully i own a really cheap saturn to get me to and from class i got it for about $ 700 so its also mostly plastic 
 in my early morning rage i decide to just <unk> his car with my car because i know he really cares about his vehicle as he is constantly cleaning and <unk> it yet he parks in the middle of the parking lot 
 a fantastic <unk> sound ensues as i slowly push into his bumper than i <unk> and pull out beside his vehicle while <unk> all 
 the 
 way 
 down 
 the side of it than i leave to work 
 when i get to work i notice a <unk> on my bumper that i smack to pop out and cleaned up some paint transfer 
 my plastic panels did not <unk> enough damage to actually break as they just bent during contact and popped out 
 when i get back home the guy is in fury and is threatening to stab me and such but i claim it was n't me and i was able to squeeze out of the spot ... so the police were called and they look at the cars and see no fresh damage on my car and say it was n't me 
 the officer also tells the guy well what the hell did you expect when you parked in the middle of the parking lot '' 
 i also discover i was not the only one to hit his vehicle as there was another mark down the side which to my delight ended up being due to one of his girl 's friends since she admitted to maybe bumping his car while backing out 
 after this incident i demanded to be let out of our lease with no penalty & amp with our security deposit 
 thankfully the office obliged and we moved to another part of town 
 added bonus : after said douche fixed his bumper and door panel someone spray painted his white car with black spray paint not me i swear 
 edit : decided to add a picture i had 
 this was taken the weekend before the incident '' the parking lines on the left are all empty spots 
 you can kinda see my saturn in front of his vehicle 
 * i had originally posted this in petty revenge but <unk> suggested i should post it here 
 enjoy 
 * when i was a little girl we did n't live on an actual street we lived on a cul-de-sac 
 my neighbors had put up a basketball <unk> at the end and it was the coolest thing because kids from all over would come and we 'd play together 
 i could get along with every one of them except for these two boys 
 from day one they called me every name in the book made fun of me called me fat threw rocks at me -- you name it 
 i remember coming home to my parents and just crying because i did n't know how to handle it 
 they explained that they could n't go out there every time i had a <unk> with someone so i should just say something back 
 next day there they come 
 there 's actually a lot of kids outside and i 'm playing with my friends and they decide to come up and start <unk> but i turned around and called them the <unk> word right there in front of god and everybody 
 you know what they did 
 they told my parents 
 i was grounded for the <unk> time 
 so apparently they ca n't handle me talking back but i knew that i got on their nerves easily 
 once i was allowed to go back outside that 's all i did was bother them 
 i refused to play with my friends because i needed to annoy them 
 i was *that* kid 
 i would just say stuff like you 're stupid '' i hate you '' your mom hates you '' you suck '' etc 
 on this particular day i was riding my bike 
 they decide to leave for some reason i ca n't remember and i call out to them yeah you better leave or i 'll run you over with my bike '' 
 you ca n't run me over with your bike '' 
 ... excuse me 
 are you are you ... trying me 
 do you have any idea how long i 've waited for something like this to happen 
 seriously 
 yeah i can run you over with my bike '' 
 okay i 'll just stand right here '' 
 ... well if you 're just going to stand there i am not going to pass up this opportunity -- are you kidding me 
 so there i go 
 i turn my bike around the end of the court and pedal as fast as i can towards him and boom run him over 
 i was so proud of myself and kind of shocked that i did it 
 i hear from under me get off me <unk> <unk> i ca n't breathe '' 
 so i <unk> over him instead of getting off the bike and he is dry <unk> so hard i almost felt bad 
 he manages to spit out a few words in between his <unk> 
 why would you do that '' 
 get off my street motherfucker '' 
 from that day on i was never bullied again 
 edit : fixed minor grammar <unk> sentences to make more sense 
 edit 2 : whenever i 'm having a conversation with someone about being bullied i 'll listen to whatever they have to say no matter how <unk> they are 
 it 's a hard subject to talk about and if you 're willing to share with me your experiences i will hear you out 
 a lot of people do n't realize this but it 's actually healthy to get upset or angry sometimes however what you do with that anger is a different story 
 and to deny yourself those feelings and to hold onto them will only turn into hatred 
 and whether you like it or not hatred is passion 
 instead of being <unk> about things you love and people you care about your passion is wasted towards brewing hatred 
 i realize that not all problems can be solved by fighting back but i am an incredibly <unk> and severely blunt person and i will not sit there idly and let someone <unk> me until all of my thoughts are <unk> by whatever things they have done to me 
 i say all that to say this -- i admit that this story is greatly exaggerated but i do n't tell this story because i want bragging rights or because violence is the answer 
 i tell this story to <unk> others to do something about their issues instead of not doing anything at all and letting all that anger bottle up inside of you the very reason this subreddit was created 
 however there is some truth to this story : i did get bullied i did get in trouble for cursing i did have <unk> intent with my bike and i did scare everyone on my block 
 so all of you motherfuckers in the comment section causing a huge commotion over something that never happened to them need to calm the fuck down <unk> and should probably do something productive at work for once instead of waste our <unk> natural resources used to create the electricity you are carelessly <unk> on trivial internet <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> employer left me with 10k of shares that can never be <unk> not within my power 
 so i reported them to the cra for <unk> fraud 
 fines are 50 % on top of what they got 
 so $ 100k means $ <unk> you need to pay the government back 
 i also reported them for running income out of the country and the operations they run out of a 3rd world nation 
 i told them also about possible tax evasion scheme they also seem to have been running 
 if found guilty the fine is likely to bankrupt the company 
 while the audit is going i 'm still continuing to pursue my money and building a case against them 
 then when i win a judgement and they do n't have cash i 'm going to go in to their offices and take their laptops and servers 
 i 'm going to copy and format them and then sell them 
 the ceo somehow has been immune to this shortage of funds '' situation and i 'm sure that there is massive fraud on their end 
 when it get 's exposed i will do everything in my power so that fucker ends up in prison 
 the money does n't even matter to me i could spend another <unk> if it ensured the destruction of his company and personal life 
 for the record this company that does n't pay me had me make their main platform which they brag about front and center on their home page 
 i was lead developer and brought it to market under insane <unk> with a inexperienced team 
 instead of thanking me they scammed me dismissed me the day the project was done without cause and did n't even give me a reference for my work that they 've significantly <unk> off over the last 2 years 
 i have 0 sympathy for them anymore the fraud needs to be exposed and i do n't care about my money just their shame 
 ceo getting <unk> in jail though would definitely be a bonus 
 it 's not just me his fucked a lot of people in the past a lot worse than me 
 they just do n't like <unk> have been working at <unk> grocery store for 8 months now and this story starts 1 month into my employment 
 it was raining outside and i was <unk> the <unk> to bring in carts for customers and a lady i will call her mrs. wonderful '' decides it is my fault that none of the available carts are dry <unk> her very loud and aggressive voice past the stand with paper towels to dry the carts right at me 
 i begin fuming inside at this entitled bitch who is too good for the <unk> but i smile and wipe down her cart for her 
 i tell her that if customers brought their carts up to the front after unloading their groceries none of them would be wet but she disregarded my statements and later left her cart in the middle of one of the handicapped spots for it to get rained on 
 the gears have begun to turn in my head 
 months go by with her coming in about twice a week to buy $ <unk> dollars worth of expensive wine and <unk> groceries for her very wealthy husband i assume based on her massive ring and <unk> <unk> gt 
 and then i became a cashier and i saw my opportunity 
 whenever i worked i would watch for her and when she got in line i would hop on a register and call her over to my line to checkout 
 everything was ready for my revenge 
 at our first encounter behind the register i slipped her salt off the belt to the side because the only reason people buy salt is because they are out and basically everything needs salt 
 i do n't ring it up its not on the receipt its not in her bags and its not hers 
 perfect 
 she comes in the next day only for salt and with a very unhappy look on her face i smirk 
 i do this a couple more times not every time because this is a long play and i can not get caught but about every third time 
 but i think she is about to put 2 and 2 together so i move to phase two of the plan 
 i start to take items off her belt at other cashiers register 
 she comes in screaming at my manager because her items keep going missing 
 on the day before i had taken the cumin from her belt on another cashiers register 
 mrs. fantastic speed walks in arms <unk> and walks up to the <unk> year old gentlemen who had <unk> her up the day before and yells where is my fucking cumin '' and he started laughing 
 made this all worth it and made me want to continue this to the next level 
 mrs. <unk> then storms over to my manager who says she will look into it but never does because she thinks mrs. <unk> is just looking for free groceries 
 then mrs. giving begins to stare intently at the belt when she is checking out 
 fuck what am i going to do now 
 so whenever i am sweeping the floors and i see her 
 i steal an item from mrs. sharing 's basket 
 even watching the belt she sees nothing happening yet her butter an egg yes only a single egg from the carton some <unk> the occasional meat and when i 'm feeling really ballsy a bottle of wine gets put swiftly back on the shelf 
 i can visibly see her breaking down week after week 
 looking in her cart to make sure everything is there every minute watching the belt being aggressive and hateful to the cashiers 
 i step it up another notch 
 i start to not steal her groceries but swap them with the competitors <unk> 
 i have no idea if she notices but it makes me feel good inside to think that she is confused when she gets home 
 one particular night i replaced her 50 dollar bottle of wine with a 3 dollar bottle which i had stored under the register one that looks <unk> similar to the one she bought and i think i saw her start to tear up when i rang the correct one up for the next day 
 at least i hope that 's what i saw 
 1 month ago i decided to lay off this woman because i think i broke her enough to say i 've gotten my revenge 
 that did n't stop her from still checking over her shoulder watching the belt staring at the screen that <unk> up the order every time she is in the store 
 but she still leaves her cart in the lot and does n't put it away so i am still taking items out of her cart every once in a while just to keep her on edge anxious and fearful and will continue to <unk> her shopping experience forever 
 so mrs. <unk> thank you for shopping at ralph 's where you get real low prices and a fast checkout 
 tl : dr - i ruined a bitchy womans life by messing with her at <unk> was out on the town one night with a group of friends when we were approached by my ex-girlfriend and her new bogan boyfriend 
 long story short my relationship with this <unk> of a woman did n't end well so she tried to confront me 
 my best mate turned around suggesting that they leave only to receive a punch to the side of the head from the boyfriend 
 i called the police reporting an assault and within minutes the offending boyfriend was arrested 
 in the following weeks he was convicted and made to pay compensation to my best mate 
 we spent the money on a great night out at this fool 's expense and he lost his job when his employer found out about the <unk> 
 so my buddy got this sweet ass bike as a gift from his parents when he started his <unk> at <unk> tech 
 he 'd had it for like a week when it was stolen while he was at school 
 my friend was very determined to get his bike back 
 so he checked craigslist and pawn shops 
 most people do this for a little while before getting tired of it and giving up 
 not my friend 
 he did this for two years and finally found his bike for sale on <unk> 's list 
 he set up a buy with the guy and informed the <unk> pd 
 they all met up the serial numbers matched keep your receipts kids and the cops arrested the bad guy 
 my friend was feeling kind of bad for the guy considering he might not have been the one who stole it until he learned from the cop he had <unk> in unpaid parking tickets got some <unk> in <unk> over this so i moved it here 
 my wife 's <unk> for about the last 3 years is a total bitch 
 my father in law takes everything lying down 
 so she started pushing him around and trying to change his whole life 
 she kicked his 19 year old son out and permanently banned him 
 even called the cops for trespassing when he came back for his stuff made him get a new job 
 she keeps making new house rules '' that everyone has to follow : no showing up unannounced 
 <unk> really 
 kids ca n't just drop by to say hi to their dad 
 wtf 
 rule arose from my wife wanting to come in when <unk> off her brother and sister after picking them up from school 
 no dogs in the house 
 dad has had this dog for 10+ years and now he has to kick it outside when it is old and sick 
 other peoples dogs are not allowed 
 she made this rule about 3 days before my wife and i left for vacation 
 dad had agreed to dog sit for us months before 
 now we have to find a new <unk> at the last minute 
 the rule was made just to <unk> the pre agreement with dad 
 her side of the family brings dogs over all the time 
 gets us all to chip in $ 200 to buy my father in law a $ <unk> gun for christmas then forgets '' to mention it was from all of us 
 we got a <unk> triangle cutting board from countertop material scrap that father in law found at his job site 
 he is a carpenter the told us sorry but money is tight right now '' 
 i 'm not greedy or anything we could have done a $ 20 limit or something 
 it 's fine if you are poor and ca n't buy people gifts but then do n't go and ask for crazy expensive gifts and then <unk> your family 
 so the latest thing is my brother in laws birthday party 4 weeks ago 
 they planned a dinner at a restaurant and set the date 
 at the end of the meal they say they can only pay for themselves cause money is tight 
 both brother in laws are working part time minimum wage and sister in law is 16 and no job still lives with dad btw that 's right wo n't pay for kids still in their house or the birthday boy after they arranged the dinner 
 so my wife and i pay for the 5 of us and we leave 
 last weekend we went over there and saw that they both had brand new cars 
 they were <unk> but still 
 so while we were all hanging out she grabbed my rum and coke thinking it was her coke 
 i just did n't say anything 
 she was 9 years sober in aa now she has to admit she drank and start over 
 my way a haha *edit* <unk> details and <unk> all started earlier last week i just went to bed at <unk> and i had fallen into a peaceful sleep only to be awoken at about <unk> by the sound of a car with one of those loud <unk> <unk> flooring it down my street 
 alright okay i can handle it on occasion maybe it 's just the kids a few streets over messing around with their <unk> or some moron on a <unk> motorcycle 
 fast forward to the next night 
 i go to bed after studying my ass off for a chemistry test tomorrow 
 all of a sudden <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 there goes the same car again this time past midnight at <unk> 
 this time i was kinda irritated because it startled me 
 the next morning my dad asks me if i heard the car to which i reply yes 
 he tells me that he was walking by the window when he heard the motor so he <unk> outside and saw a car with <unk> head and <unk> floor it down our street 
 i ask several of my best friends in the neighborhood if they heard it and sure enough they did including my friend that lives two streets over 
 the next day i 'm playing with my cat in the living room after dinner and i hear the same muffler this time driving slowly down my street 
 i opened the <unk> and caught a glimpse of a black bmw m3 drive up a driveway of a house at the end of my street 
 this house in particular has a lot of college parties because sometimes i can see drunk and high people stumbling around through the big glass windows sometimes naked 
 suprise surprise 
 later that evening before it got dark i drove past the house and wrote down the license plate number make and model of the car 
 sure enough later that night our good ol friend <unk> <unk> comes <unk> down my street 
 this time i parked my car down on the street and filmed him flooring his bmw down my street 
 at this point i 'm done 
 your three strikes are up buddy this means war 
 one day passes without sight nor sound of the bmw 
 by this time it 's friday the day when that house commonly has parties 
 now for the revenge part of the story 
 little does this guy know my <unk> friend 's dad is a cop 
 since i dated his daughter we got to know eachother fairly well 
 anyways after dinner sure enough mr. speed <unk> comes rolling up to the house followed by <unk> of other scummy looking college students 
 i text my ex asking for her dad 's number 
 i give him a call and explain the <unk> 
 he told me to send him a text with the video plate number make model and the address of the party house along with the time range mr. <unk> leaves so he can email it directly to the <unk> officer 
 later that night he replies that a unit is set up at the end of my street waiting for dr. <unk> to come <unk> down my street and sure enough it happens this time at about <unk> i go back to sleep hoping the cop caught him 
 in the morning after sleeping in i check my texts and sure enough my ex 's dad pulls through 
 it ends up they caught him speeding <unk> in possession of <unk> disturbing the peace and with illegal modifications on his car 
 no muffler lastly i heard he is now paying some hefty tickets and fines and spending a bit of time in jail with his nice car impounded for a dui 
 tl dr- never ever <unk> my slumber repeatedly 
 it will not end well for you 
 <unk> edit : this was originally written by me under a different reddit account on /r/pettyrevenge 
 a poster there suggested i should post here so i did on my new account 
 *** i 'm <unk> and every summer i spend time in a summer camp over there 
 great place lots of fun memories <unk> for one thinking about working there next year 
 this story takes place several summers ago 
 the previous school year was <unk> for me had a few things gone differently i might not be here today so i was happy i 'd get two months in russia before switching high schools 
 the first of three sessions at camp went well i got a leadership award celebrated my birthday watched russia <unk> in the <unk> 
 that session ended and within two days the next one started with new kids 
 the leadership award i got on the previous session somewhat <unk> me to be more active in the camp 
 so first day in the afternoon i 'm walking around meeting new people 
 walk into a male room of the city younger than us call them city # 2 
 we lived in a building of 72 with kids broken up into six cities '' of 12 each led by a lord/lady the equivalent of a counselor 
 anyway i walk into this room say hi start chatting 
 a couple of the kids are making small talk a third is lying on his bed facing away from me playing on his phone 
 i try to get something going with him silence 
 another attempt the guy flips me the bird and says fuck off will you 
 his english nickname at the camp turned out to be blaine '' 
 i tried to get along with him and the other boys in his city and things got better 
 or maybe just less blatant 
 the boys in my city started flirting with the girls both in our city and in city # 2 blaine 's city 
 the first few days were fine but slowly blaine and his roommates starting acting annoyed that our city was <unk> on their '' females 
 it did n't matter that they sat on their asses all day playing on their phones they wanted the girls from their city to be talking to them only 
 i tried to stay off to the side of this mainly because i had <unk> luck flirting with people and because i felt that this would only get worse 
 but i still for some reason decided to play wingman for the other kids in my room 
 this got to the point where i faked <unk> at night so that the counselor watching our hallway would be distracted enough to let messer my roommate slip down the hall <unk> 
 after that particular episode messer decided i should n't keep playing wingman and decided that he 'd help me find a girl 
 one week left 
 no fucking problem 
 messer went about trying to find me a second half me <unk> along for shits and giggles 
 he very quickly settled on esme a relatively tall blonde girl from city # 2 
 i took it upon myself to get acquainted with her because well she was pretty attractive for a 14 year old 
 in most other situations this would wind up being a borderline <unk> submission with enough of my <unk> to go around 
 but that did n't happen here 
 the afternoon after highly suggesting '' who i should try and hook up with our building went to the pool 
 i chatted a bit with esme and it went reasonably well by any standards 
 i thought something had started 
 all the while the relationship between the two oldest cities was <unk> to dust 
 someone from city # 2 tried to spook a girl of ours during an <unk> event by firing into her lane while she was picking <unk> up as multiple people nearby had fired simultaneously no one knew who was guilty 
 purposefully too high to hit anything but close enough to spook 
 tim my roommate built like a lineman retaliated by fucking with city # 2 's <unk> drinks putting salt in some pepper in others <unk> oil in a third 
 things were getting relatively heated 
 anyway before i had a chance to tank any <unk> i made the next day blaine did that for me 
 you see esme was *his* girl and i 'd be damned if i did n't know that 
 more so i was from city # 1 so now by flirting with his girl i had signed myself on to the conflict 
 blaine or one of his cronies started by writing a gossip note '' in our building 's gossip box '' a place where one could drop anonymous notes that if deemed appropriate were read at the daily announcements 
 the note put in there contained a whole lot of shit calling various people <unk> telling our head lord he was a drunk idiot and naming city # 2 's lady a <unk> <unk> fucktard '' 
 the note was signed hunter15991 '' 
 now anyone with a brain if they saw this note would understand hunter15991 has enough sense not to write something like that and sign his name 
 as i 'm sitting in my room in walks the lady from city # 2 
 i had actually known her from the previous year of camp and was on quite friendly terms with her 
 our lady follows 
 city # 2 's lady looks pissed and she shows me the <unk> note and asks me why i thought this way why the hell am i coming here if i 'm so <unk> etc 
 etc 
 our lady followed up by saying this was good for two warnings and a removal of the leadership award i got the previous session 
 i was stunned by all of this and told them that in no way i thought any of that why the hell would i sign my name that this was some horrible set-up 
 i managed to argue it down to one warning but was shaken 
 blaine had immediately gone for the <unk> 
 a few hours later we started our second <unk> game of the day 
 at the camp each day had a theme '' like indians police business 
 this day was military and the second game was one where two enemy <unk> with different <unk> paper strips taped to their shoulder fought each other around the territory of the camp trying to tear off each other 's lives '' strips of paper taped to the shoulder 
 i was placed into one army blaine and esme into another 
 the game started and we were maneuvered around by the lord in charge 
 we encountered the enemy and engaged them i was running with a couple of other older boys finding high value targets and <unk> them 
 one of my comrades was george a guy from our city 
 the other was imber a <unk> douche who lived with blaine was n't there on the first day 
 imber peeled off to take care of some annoying city # <unk> while george and i tried to run a pincer around messer 
 as i 'm shuffling closer towards messer who was busy shuffling away from george i was keeping my eye out for anybody trying to <unk> me from behind 
 even with george watching my other side as he closed in this left a 45 degree blindspot in vision around my right shoulder 
 something charged into this blindspot at full fucking force knocking me to the ground 
 i try to roll over to see if it was someone who <unk> me from behind 
 nope no one retreating into that direction whoever hit me must have continued running 
 at that moment messer no longer cornered but still pursued by george ran up and quickly tore my strip off and then ran off to shake off george 
 i started to push myself up to a sitting position but before i got anywhere someone stepped on me 
 or more exactly ran onto over and through me 
 that stunned me for a second and i lay there trying to regain my breath 
 for some reason i rolled over and saw blaine running off about 10 feet from me 
 the direction he was going in the lack of anyone else in that immediate area - that fucker had just purposefully run over me 
 finally our general ordered a retreat i do n't know why he did not pause the game when i was knocked down like he was supposed to 
 i walked back to our group and george told me that imber - <unk> on our side was the guy who knocked me down 
 i <unk> him with this and he claimed that he had seen blaine and went off to kill him accidentally '' bumping me 
 malicious intent obviously could not be proven 
 well fuck that i did n't need a goddamn jury blaine was going to pay for what he and imber just did 
 i made him my only target for the remaining three battles 
 first battle - nothing 
 on the second one i came close to tearing it off but was ultimately killed myself by an unrelated player 
 third battle 
 last life 
 final opportunity to show this fucker that yes you can push me down but i will still find you and still kill you 
 i ran around that field chasing my only target 
 nothing could stand in my way every city # 5 or city # 6 kid who charged up to me was killed 
 i finally ended up <unk> feet behind blaine as he was knocking it out with someone else 
 i saw my opportunity and charged 
 blaine did n't turn around until the final two steps - which put his right shoulder directly in my path 
 i could have <unk> him ripping his strip off and <unk> it into the grass 
 but unlike blaine i did n't want to break any rules 
 so i shout my palm forward 
 ripped the strip off and <unk> slightly to the left to avoid hitting him 
 i had killed him 
 blaine 's <unk> in-game life was now sitting crumpled in my hands 
 i was now the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> 
 i darted around looking for my next target and spotted n one of our girls both city and army under attack 
 someone else was ripping at n literally practically scratching with finger nails and trying to slow down n by <unk> on to her ponytail 
 i recognized that blonde blur 
 esme 
 i did n't hold a grudge against her like i did against blaine but that was brutal play right there and it 'd be much less brutal if esme was dead as well 
 i closed in 
 15 ... 10 ... stop 
 stop 
 someone was blaring a <unk> 
 i felt someone bear hug me as well turning my charge into more of a standing crawl 
 and then suddenly i was losing ground being pulled back 
 the game had stopped 
 even the <unk> catfight had died down 
 people were staring at ... <unk> my they were staring at me 
 staring at me getting dragged out of the game by a counselor yelling at me for brutal play 
 this counselor had spent two years out of high school in the russian <unk> so i decided to shut up and not resist 
 i was dragged over to our cities lady 
 hunter15991 your play out there was very brutal and dangerous 
 because we had to drag you out of the game we 're giving you a second warning 
 the only reason you 're not losing your leader title is because you got these warnings separately '' 
 at first i honestly believed her - maybe in my wrath i did manage to knock a kid down 
 i played a lot <unk> than other kids but oh well shit happens 
 who do i <unk> ... wait a fucking second off in the distance i saw blaine and imber leaning against the building 
 both were dead not in the game and thus had the freedom to talk 
 suddenly blaine tapped imber on the shoulder pointed where i was sitting and the two started laughing 
 those bastards 
 he had complained and gotten me pulled from the game and a warning given to me on top of that 
 whatever doubt i had left <unk> when my lady said the other party in the situation was fine '' 
 if i had knocked down a 12 year old they most certainly would n't be fine '' - the medic would be looking them over and i 'd be told to apologize 
 but there was no one to apologize to - because this was all a fucking setup 
 so there i sat for the rest of the game trying to think of what i 'd do next 
 i had already tried to take revenge on blaine but he had upped the ante 
 i had to do something total 
 something to which there could be no response 
 and then it hit me 
 blaine was watching the warnings rise on me one more warning and i 'd be stripped of my award sent home and banned from the camp for a whole <unk> year 
 given that i still had a session to go that would mean $ 1000 or so flushed down the toilet 
 why not give blaine some warnings 
 but the score was too <unk> for minor retaliation 
 at <unk> if i <unk> blaine into his first warning he 'd respond with forcing my third and final warning a situation impossible to recover from 
 of course i could <unk> myself enough to lower the chances of those warnings but that 'd make these last five days not fun at all 
 i needed to get him 3 all at once 
 from experience <unk> around in his room the day before trying to find proof of the notes he had wrote i noticed blaine had brought an <unk> with him to camp 
 i normally do n't give a fuck even if you 're 14 whatever <unk> your boat 
 but this time that was solid solid evidence against him 
 it anything would get him out immediately it was the cig 
 but i could n't just bring it to the attention of the lords that would be too easy too <unk> and for all i knew i 'd get my third warning for snooping around people 's rooms 
 i had to accidentally '' find it in the presence of a lord/lady and then draw their attention to it without simply saying blaine why do you have an ecig in your room 
 i started to think about how to purposefully discover '' something in front of other people and yet still look innocent 
 i woke up the next day and a plan immediately came into my mind 
 the schedule in the hallway which i had read while brewing tea in the morning told us today was supposed to be adventures '' day whose main event was an <unk> activity where two cities under the direction of the older city 's lord/lady # 5 led city # 5 and city # 6 etc 
 moved around trying to solve <unk> in various rooms 
 that meant i 'd be sitting in the same room as blaine several times today under jurisdiction of our city 's lady 
 after lunch i walked up to the head lord and asked him what rooms would be in use and if i needed to clean my room 
 i was told no the only rooms in use would be the following four 
 one of those rooms was blaine 's 
 everything had fallen in place 
 during quiet hour while the main hall was empty i got into the possessions of our city 's lady 
 inside was a bag of lindor truffles she obsessed over 
 i took those truffles and hid them under my bed until blaine 's room left for english lessons 
 i bolted in there and placed the bag of truffles inside a more-or-less empty drawer that i knew contained a couple bottles of soda 
 i then <unk> around for the ecig and placed it in there as well 
 perfect 
 the day continued along we went to have dinner after the first event and then were split into our three groups of two cities for the second event 
 just like i had remembered from past sessions we were paired with city # 2 
 in we went finally into the <unk> '' our <unk> building and we went from room to room solving <unk> 
 we approached blaine 's room 3rd went in and sat down 
 our lady started her script about what we needed to do in the room it was <unk> a curse of some sorts by <unk> various mundane objects in the correct order 
 at a stopping point i interrupted and asked blaine if i could have a drink since i was sitting on his bed next to his drawers with soda 
 fine '' he said 
 you can be total 14 year old asses to one another in russia but you had a social obligation to share food 
 to his credit all he expected to see was a couple of bottles of soda 
 i started to open the drawer and before our lady could interrupt me about disturbing the game i opened it and pulled out the lindor 
 while i 'm at it could i have some 
 i held the bag and asked blaine 
 he looked at it strangely 
 our lady looked at him strangely cut off mid sentence by finding her bag - for she had noticed it missing right after dinner - right in blaine 's drawers 
 what is this '' 
 she asked point at the bag 
 blaine was <unk> something out as our lady got up and walked towards the drawers 
 this is when the killer blow struck 
 she walked over to me and grabbed the bag prepared to <unk> off a lecture about stealing items 
 then she noticed the ecig 
 that woman might have valued her lindor but upon <unk> the ecig the lindor fell to the floor 
 up went the cigarette 
 blaine was pale as a sheet as our lady turned around and stood there <unk> with the cigarette 
 after 10 seconds she said go downstairs inform the head lord of this ... <unk> ... and then pack your bags '' 
 blaine left the room and we continued playing the <unk> game 
 suddenly the hostility we had experienced in previous games had subsided 
 blaine spent his last hours at the camp standing at the security post waiting for his mother 's car to arrive from moscow <unk> miles to the northeast 
 i had managed to make it <unk> and god did i <unk> in that golden goal 
 but there was still one last thing to do 
 if you remember i never got around to killing esme in the military game 
 her catfight had gone <unk> 
 i let it slide until the final day 
 awards for the campers were being discussed between the lords and ladies 
 there were two <unk> - permanent awards like the one i got the previous session that came with a title discount website mention and single-session awards that did not role over from year to year 
 i was asked to check nickname spelling for each kid that won an award 
 esme somehow qualified for a single-session award and i smiled as i saw her name 
 no no this one 's wrong it should be spelled <unk> trust me on this one '' 
 sure enough esme was called up to the stage and received her certificate <unk> <unk> '' : an example of being an active camper '' and corresponding name badge 
 i chuckled as she looked at the name and slowly put it in her pocket 
 was that a bit too much 
 potentially 
 but two years later when i ran into her again she had gotten a higher title with the correct spelling on it 
 no for those of you asking nothing ever happened between me and her 
 i was already thoroughly put off by the whole blaine experience and by the time i added her on the russian equivalent of facebook and noticed her flurry of white <unk> posts all drive was lost 
 **tl dr : roommate at summer camp <unk> drags me into conflict between two groups of males by introducing me to a <unk> acquaintance of the other group 
 i am targeted by that group for <unk> trying to flirt with her because she is <unk> despite them not really going after her 
 am slandered injured and come pretty close to being banned from summer camp i loved 
 instead i manage to get their leader kicked out by setting him up for theft and tobacco possession 
 ** alright 
 this was told to me by a friend 
 he is the pilot of the story 
 this happened on a towboat 
 a towboat holds about <unk> people 
 the captain is the highest and his word is pretty much law on a vessel then the relief captain then pilot then <unk> then <unk> 
 the captain who we will call cap was a <unk> dick 
 he constantly tormented the deck crew 
 he lost over 50 deckhands in one year 
 deckhands would literally just leave the boat whenever the boat would dock for fuel or for barge transfers 
 the captain was giving a stern talking to but considering that <unk> are like gold it would take an extreme amount to get them fired 
 enter riou 
 riou was an innocent faced 18 year old kid 
 he was very eager to learn and tried to take the initiative to do as much as he could 
 he had a great attitude and my friend could easily seem him <unk> soon 
 cap on the other hand had a permanent stick shoved up his ass and hated riou 
 he would constantly make homophobic slurs against riou 
 frequently implying that he would n't even let riou perform certain sexual favors no matter how much riou begged 
 riou at first took it well 
 he just figured it was new guy <unk> but even the other more experienced deck hands thought this was extreme 
 not because of what was being said but because of the <unk> behind it 
 cap also gave riou extremely ridiculous jobs like telling him to go out with a toothbrush and scrub the barge 
 it 's around a 110 degrees in august and he is having this kid on his hands and knees on a heater barge that has heaters that heat the <unk> so it does n't <unk> inside the barge 
 so the barge is easily 300 degrees 
 my friend did what he could to help the guy because he did n't want him to quit 
 he was telling him that he only had to make it 3 more weeks then he could request a transfer to another boat and he would make sure he got it 
 riou had other plans 
 so to make sure you guys understand what happened 
 watches are 6 hours long 
 captain was on front watch so he worked 6 to 12 both times 
 the pilot worked back watch which was 12 to 6. the wheelhouse is the usually the highest point of the boat 
 this boat had 4 decks 
 wheel house on the top then the pilots rooms on the third deck then the second deck which housed the crew then the bottom deck which was the galley engine room generator room and <unk> room 
 stairs separate each of the decks 
 so cap just relieved my pilot friend and he was heading downstairs to his room to get some stuff then go eat breakfast 
 riou was heading up to the wheelhouse as the captain usually calls him up there first thing in the morning to give him his shit list 
 as my friend was coming out of his room he heard riou screaming along the lines of no get your hands off me stop 
 <unk> 
 why are you doing this '' 
 then the pilot hears a large <unk> 
 he ran to the <unk> case and saw riou laying at the bottom in a crumpled heap and cap up at the top screaming stuff at riou 
 my friend thought the captain finally snapped and tried to kill a <unk> he did <unk> that he would do it often enough 
 so the office is contacted 
 they had to get riou off the boat and to the hospital 
 i believe he ended up having a couple broken ribs a broken wrist and i believe a <unk> 
 the local authorities are called and cap is arrested after they took everyone 's story 
 riou claimed that cap pushed him down the stairs 
 cap lost his job his license i think he was put on parole 
 my friend said he never talked to him again and only heard about what happened through other <unk> 
 riou on the other hand healed nicely and even continued <unk> 
 fast forward 5-6 years and riou is now an experienced engineer when my friend is riding over to make some extra cash and is put on the same boat as riou 
 before my friend got off the boat riou confessed to him that riou did it to himself because he could n't take it anymore 
 my friend had a lot of self <unk> issues with this story as to whether or not to tell the office the truth but so far he still has n't 
 it 's been about 10 years since this has happened 
 tl : dr captain gets arrested for karma 
 **i had originally posted this in r/pettyrevenge but it was suggested that i cross post it here <unk> does it count as petty revenge if the target did n't specifically do anything to me personally 
 a few years ago i went back to school to get another ba because the first time around my gpa could be <unk> called aggressively mediocre '' and i really wanted to go to grad school 
 my wife had a full time job at the time so i did n't need to get a part time job or anything but i get bored easily 
 i applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and was n't particularly demanding work 
 it was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the <unk> of various dorms on weekends and checking <unk> of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest 
 it was part of the campus safety initiative 
 most of the time i just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last <unk> is in canada so it 's pretty normal for <unk> to be legal drinking age 
 occasionally i was asked to <unk> around campus and ticket cars that were <unk> parked 
 i did n't mind the walking but <unk> students never sat well with <unk> has money for that shit <unk> this was not my favorite part of the job 
 as an aside i tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard 
 fuck the man 
 anyway one day in the late <unk> above freezing but not by <unk> was outside the engineering building and i saw a newish bmw <unk> maybe it was an m3 i do n't recall so i 'm just going to say it was an m3 for <unk> in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags 
 as usual i approach the car slowly like i 'm sneaking up on it 
 i discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive 
 i 've found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud <unk> car owner tends to <unk> an <unk> crowd 
 it 's better to sneak up on the car confirm that it is in fact illegally parked or has an expired pass walk away write the ticket and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper 
 & gt be me meter nazi & gt use <unk> ticket & gt it is very effective i wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off 
 i did another walk around the rear parking lot and then because it was near the end of my shift i returned to that same building because there was a tim 's inside and i wanted to grab lunch and a coffee 
 i go inside get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke 
 i 'm standing by the smoking pawn do n't actually know what these things are <unk> in one hand sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket smoke in the other hand and just zone out 
 next thing i know there 's some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly 
 i zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the m3 
 he 's this skinny dude wearing a puffy vest and he 's got fancy hair 
 i figure he 's probably 18 or 19 
 20 tops 
 he 's got the yellow envelope in one hand and he 's all fucking shit fuck fuck dick cunt shit fuck motherfucker etc '' 
 while he 's swearing and having a bit of a spaz he 's also looking around presumably to see if the meter nazi is still around so he can give him a piece of his mind 
 oh wait i 'm the meter nazi 
 and i 'm like 30 feet away 
 still smoking 
 sandwich in my pocket coffee in the other hand parking ticket printer slung across my chest 
 well shit 
 & gt be me & gt be at the end of your shift & gt expect to be yelled at by puffy vest fancy hair i steel myself for the eventual tirade 
 policy is we have to be all <unk> about <unk> 
 our interactions should consist of yes sir/ma'am '' no sir/ma'am '' i understand sir/ma'am '' but overall being firm about why they received a ticket 
 he swings his vision around several times but does n't seem to spot me 
 i 'm not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory blue campus security jacket and a <unk> <unk> 
 he keeps looking around 
 left 
 right 
 left 
 right 
 i take another drag 
 for whatever reason he does n't see me 
 he angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car <unk> the car with his remote <unk> heads back into the <unk> 
 so i 'm still standing by the smoking pawn sandwich in my pocket <unk> medium <unk> old medium not the new <unk> <unk> one drag left on my smoke 
 so i finish my smoke feed the pawn and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich 
 i 'm sitting on the bench eating my sandwich drinking my coffee and staring at this m3 that is still parked in the handicap space 
 i 'm gon na finish my sandwich drink my double-double <unk> another <unk> and then i 'm going to give him another ticket '' says i to myself 
 it 's a trap '' replies my brain making a very good point 
 i dunno man this is too good of an opportunity to pass up '' 
 i 'm just saying '' how could it be a trap 
 what he has a gang of puffy vested bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a dance off do whatever you want just no <unk> '' 
 my brain made a valid point 
 this would be an excellent trap 
 i pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth wash it down with my now <unk> double-double and light up another <unk> <unk> light <unk> with the <unk> cigarette <unk> warning no <unk> stare at the entrance to the engineering building 
 no sign of puffy vest fancy hair 
 with one hand i start <unk> out the ticket on the printer but do n't press the print '' button <unk> i hit the button it saves the data and there 's no way to <unk> it once that happens 
 i was n't yet ready to commit to this course of action 
 i finish my second cigarette pull out a yellow envelope take a breath and hit print '' as i start walking toward the car 
 the <unk> printer quickly spits out the ticket and i quickly insert the ticket into the envelope and <unk> it under the wiper 
 nothing happens 
 no ambush 
 no screaming 
 no puffy vest fancy hair 
 all that <unk> for nothing 
 i check my <unk> i recall correctly it was a <unk> flip phone of some <unk> shift ended a few minutes ago 
 i 'm not technically in any hurry to get back to the office we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so i 'm not preventing anyone from starting their shift by <unk> 
 i use the camera <unk> a whopping <unk> <unk> take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper 
 then i walk into the engineering building get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area and i hope that this kid is n't in a three hour class 
 i 'm now here for a show 
 i 'm going to get yelled at it 'll be a huge scene i 'll have to be all professional about it but seeing puffy vest fancy hair have another spaz is totally worth it 
 you 're an idiot '' says my brain 
 i let my coffee cool just for a bit before i take a <unk> 
 of course i forgot to check where the paper cup <unk> was and <unk> coffee down my chin 
 son of a bitch 
 i put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee <unk> from my chin just as i hear another stream of cunt fuck motherfucker what the fucking fuck '' <unk> from the vicinity of the m3 
 who the fuck did this '' 
 what the fuck '' 
 there 's puffy vest fancy hair : sack of fast food in one hand jumbo fountain drink in the <unk> to have the <unk> of a 19 year-old <unk> 's <unk> around trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm 
 he 's now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by 
 for some reason he still has n't spotted me 
 i 'm standing a mere 30 feet from where he is spazzing 
 i am right beside the smoking pawn wearing a blue jacket that says campus security '' on it 
 i have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest 
 for some reason his gaze never <unk> on me at all 
 after a few more seconds of spazzing he gets in his car throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away 
 why he did n't see me is inexplicable 
 the only <unk> i have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else 
 maybe a high visibility vest or maybe something like this i dunno 
 i do n't recall how much those tickets run a few hundred i think but that kid had one expensive day 
 my boss did tell me that the kid 's father called in pretty pissed about the tickets 
 i had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because i figured he 'd probably ask my why i wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day 
 my boss explained to the kid 's father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle remove the ticket and leave it counted as a separate parking incident thus two tickets were warranted 
 **tl dr guy in puffy vest gets a double shot of karma for parking in handicap zone 
 <unk> up : my uncle enlisted at the beginning of world war 2 just like his 2 brothers and all his friends 
 he was sent to europe after training and saw a lot of action 
 as a private he had a very nasty sgt 
 that picked on him a lot even though he was a year older than the sgt 
 it could 've been because my uncle was a <unk> practicing mormon 
 he did n't smoke drink or chase women 
 the sgt 
 gave him all of the crap details dressed him down and held up <unk> 
 in one combat action my uncle personally captured a german colonel and his entire headquarters staff he brought home the colonel 's full dress uniform <unk> <unk> <unk> and even the boots 
 because of this action my uncle was sent back to the states to attend officer 's candidate school 
 the sgt 
 tried to stop that but could n't 
 it was too big a deal 
 the revenge : uncle returns to europe and does well rapidly <unk> from 2nd lt. to lt. to <unk> 
 and is given a new company 
 in the new company is the nasty ol <unk> who is still a <unk> 
 when he found out who the new <unk> 
 was he about shit a brick 
 uncle had him called to his hq and had him sit outside his office for 6 hours and then sent his aide out to give him his transfer papers 
 uncle walked out of his office past the sgt 
 and does n't say a word to him does n't look at him or even break his <unk> as he walked past 
 i asked my uncle why he never got back at the sgt 
 uncle said he did : he <unk> an officer and went on to live a fantastic life full of adventure love and excitement 
 the sgt 
 was always just a pos 
 hi everyone would firstly like to say a big thanks to every who has subscribed and contributed to this sub we now have over <unk> subscribers 
 the mods have had a talk and we have decided it is time to <unk> a couple of rule changes to make /r/prorevenge a better place 
 effective immediately posts asking for ideas or suggestions about how to get revenge will be removed 
 example - posts like this will no longer be allowed 
 please submit full revenge stories only 
 also starting now posts which seem very unbelievable may be removed by the mods unless the op can provide proof this may be messaged to the mods 
 edit : we will not require proof for every post only posts that seem fake asking for proof will definitely not be the norm 
 those are the only two new rules we think these will better the sub and make it a better place 
 i would just like to make a reminder an existing rule : cross posting <unk> are allowed and encouraged but we ask that you please copy the text into a new self-post on this subreddit instead of providing just a link to the original post - a link to the original post may also be provided just not by itself 
 please also remember to credit the op if the revenge story is not yours 
 example - this post only provides a link 
 example - this x-post has the text copied into a self-post on this sub 
 that 's it again thanks to everyone who has subscribed and contributed here hopefully these changes will make /r/prorevenge a better place 
 please upvote this post for visibility i gain no karma as it is a self-post 
 edit : this is important : please note that we would like to strongly <unk> that proof will only be asked for in exceptional <unk> ie 
 the story is very very unbelievable and we are <unk> % sure it never happened but we would like to give you chance to prove us <unk> in the 1990s i was enjoying college life much the same as any kid 
 though i had a great many friends i was n't popular with the ladies at the time due to my extreme <unk> 
 even when girls would show interest i either did n't pick up on it or was way too shy to do anything about it 
 so the big man on campus bmoc lived next to me in our dorm 
 you know the type - good looking rich family born on third base and thinks he hit a triple 
 this is the kind of guy you saw with a different girl every week 
 he left of trail of broken hearts on his wake but it takes two to <unk> so whatever 
 now one day bmoc decided he did n't like me 
 i 'm guessing mostly because i was n't successful with the ladies like himself 
 i was a quiet neighbor <unk> early to bed type who rarely said a word so i cant imagine i did anything to gain his ire 
 nevertheless he decided to torment me every chance he got for a few weeks - physical aggression verbal assaults about my lack of <unk> typical immature bullshit 
 anyways i had enough and went to work with a little revenge scheme 
 i was visiting the er of the local hospital with flu symptoms when a brilliant idea hit me 
 sitting in the patient room waiting for a nurse to see me i noticed a stack of letterhead with the hospital 's information on top 
 i popped a few of the papers it into my backpack and after my visit returned to my dorm room 
 and <unk> 
 i wrote a professional sounding medical term <unk> letter to bmoc detailing the fact that a young girl had come into their free clinic who had been diagnosed with syphilis 
 she had given the name of several of her sexual partners including bmoc and they were requesting he come in to get checked out 
 i dropped the letter into campus mail on thursday which means he would receive it in his box on friday 
 oh did i mention the clinic he received the letter from was only open <unk> 
 : thus he would have to wait a few days to contact them and get tested 
 bmoc received his letter on friday confirmed by <unk> friend who worked in the campus post office 
 every time i saw him the next few days he looked like he had seen a ghost 
 not really sure of the outcome at the hospital when he showed up with fake letter in hand but i do know he chilled right the fuck out the rest of that semester 
 i imagine having the shit scared out of you will do that to a <unk> 
 **tl/dr : ** sexually <unk> asshole bully is tricked into thinking he might have gotten <unk> <unk> <unk> mary 19 and i are really close 
 she has this boyfriend steve 21 that she 's been with for about 4 years now 
 the boyfriend has an older sister who is a complete mess doesn’t work lives off gov't aide and her parents does drugs dates <unk> in and out of jail etc 
 we 'll call her jenny 25 
 j has a son brandon who is <unk> this story happened almost 3 years ago 
 she still does n't know it was me 
 since mary and i are so close i used to go over to her boyfriends with her often 
 jenny and steve lived with their parents at the time since jenny got evicted from her section 8 apartment for promoting violence 
 she was always around 
 she did n't have a job 
 she was super violent and aggressive towards everyone all the time 
 she used to threaten to fight her parents and brother all the time 
 the cops were always being called because she could n't keep her hands off of people 
 she was also going through this really long dragged out court process with her sons father tate 
 she was trying to keep tate from seeing brandon 
 she succeeded for 2 years but the guy wised up and took her ass to court 
 mary and i grew up without our fathers and the thought of brandon never knowing his dad and being raised by his <unk> mother really <unk> on my heart strings 
 one time jenny reached out to me on facebook saying she did n't want to be a mom and she was thinking about giving brandon up for <unk> 
 i screen shot the messages and sent them to tate 
 i did n't hear another thing about it until months later 
 i 'm not sure how she found out or why she blamed my sister but jenny attacked mary while she was sleeping 
 she just started punching her in the face repeatedly and calling her a <unk> 
 mary and i are black and white mixed everyone else in this story are all white 
 steve called the police but jenny took off before they arrived 
 it was n't until after the incident we found out it was because she thought mary was <unk> as me and sending the messages to tate 
 jenny was arrested a week or so later for assault and battery 
 mary filed charges and got a restraining order 
 jenny spent almost a month in jail waiting for her <unk> but just before thanksgiving her mom bailed her out 
 her terms were that she could not contact mary in anyway or be within 100 yards of her 
 here 's where the revenge comes in 
 i knew jenny 's facebook password and i logged in using a <unk> <unk> and sent my sister threatening messages 
 my sister screen shot them and sent them to her victim rights advocate 
 jenny was arrested again the next day for failure to comply with her bond agreement 
 jenny thinks it was tate 's wife even to this day who sent those messages and hacked '' into her facebook 
 she thinks tate 's wife is still hacking into her facebook 
 she 's become so paranoid about it 
 it 's hilarious to watch really 
 unfortunately jenny is still as violent and volatile as ever 
 edit for names 
 i was going to post this in petty revenge but my friend said it would do better here so here i go 
 now note i did this because i read this somewhere else and thought i would try it 
 & amp nbsp <unk> : ** about three weeks ago a kid that goes to my school and me got into a fight the night before playing hockey 
 so he apparently had n't vented all his anger towards me and popped the front and back tire of my bike in two locations 
 he was actually very smart to do this as i only have two patches in my patch kit 
 now as i 've said in other stories my school is about 8k away from my house 
 my parents were out of town for a while and my brother ca n't legally drive 
 so i was stuck with the option of ride my bike home and destroy my rims or walk 
 so i walked 
 and walked 
 and walked 
 as soon as i got home i went on to reddit to try to find other peoples revenge in similar situations and found one that suited me perfectly ... .. & amp nbsp **revenge : ** at my school you can rent lockers by asking the secretary for a key to locker number xxx or something 
 you can have these lockers for two weeks for free then you start to have to pay for them 
 1 $ <unk> 
 my friends saw the fight happen and agreed to help me with revenge 
 two weeks before the end of the school year we all 6 of us started going in every two hours or so and checking out keys with a different secretary each time 
 there were 3 
 then we 'd wait three or so days and repeat 
 we got 28 keys in all three days before the end of the year 
 on the final day we all had to go to an end of the year <unk> 
 however me and all my friends skipped grabbed his phone out from his desk and started our plan 
 we locked his phone in a locker then the key to that locker in a locker along with a complicated math equation to tell him what locker number the key he had went to 
 then locked <unk> key in another locker 
 we repeated this with all the keys until we had just the first key and a math equation 
 we set those in his desk and wait 
 i will update to see how he reacts hope you liked my revenge 
 **tl dr : ** guy makes me walk 8k home i make him do math 
 **edit : ** he finally got his phone back and my friend told a friend who told guy in story who 's now really mad at us 
 i also as final revenge locked his locker key in a locker when he was busy and took the idea of a <unk> thanks <unk> and wrote an equation that said how many steps northeast or something he had to walk to get the key to get his key back : **edit 2 : ** alot of people are asking this i picked up all the keys he used when he was working on the next locker and i gave them back to the <unk> i was about 12 years old i lived at the end of a <unk> street 
 my friends and i all loved sports & amp since my road had no traffic it was the perfect setting for all our football & amp street hockey games 
 about 5 houses up from mine on the opposite side of the street there lived an old man who was a complete asshole 
 his favorite thing to do was to sit in his living room & amp stare out his front window looking for shit to complain about 
 he would seriously bitch about the most trivial shit trying to get us in trouble 
 he would call my parents because we were going too fast on our bicycles because we had hung on the <unk> of our own personal basketball goal ... it was ridiculous 
 one day he took the shit too far though 
 for christmas i had gotten one of those neat <unk> <unk> with a tail that you could throw a mile 
 it was just a couple days after i got it & amp we were playing football in the street when one of my friends missed a catch & amp the ball took an odd bounce landing right in ol dickhead 's front yard 
 like a geriatric flash his old ass was out the door snatching the ball up & amp carrying it back inside 
 i ran up and knocked on the door and asked for it back because it was my football & amp he basically told me to go fuck myself it was on his property & amp it 's his football now 
 little did this old man know that just recently my friends & amp i had developed the technology to fill water balloons with any kind of liquid we wanted 
 this fancy piece of engineering was a simple 2 liter coke bottle 
 the trick is to fill the bottle with liquid blow up the balloon with air <unk> it closed & amp then put he balloon on the neck of the bottle 
 simply turn it upside down & amp your balloon is now full of whatever 
 i rallied the troops and we went to work on building up our weapons cache 
 we all took turns pissing in the bottle until it was full put on some kitchen gloves & amp started filling balloons 
 in the end we had about 4 or 5 good ones 
 as soon as the balloons were full we <unk> into action 
 we all unloaded our ordinance right on his front door watching as the balloons <unk> their steaming <unk> all over the entry way 
 we all bolted for some nearby bushes to hide & amp watch the show 
 hearing the impacts ol dickhead comes flying out the door & amp almost busts ass from slipping in the puddle of piss 
 he let loose with one of the best fits of rage i 've had the pleasure of hearing to this day 
 never did get that football back but after hearing my side of the story my dad bought me a new one 
 original thread : here so i honestly had no idea it got big or that people cared so i am super sorry that i did n't update sooner 
 it did n't seem like anything happened right away so i was feeling a <unk> update would suck but it all worked out really nicely 
 my manager updated me on the situation a bit 
 so the day i came back it turned out they had taken her up to hr and told her they knew about the comments 
 she demanded to see the print outs but they said no 
 when she came back down she was pissed off and was for days after that whispering to people about how unfair it all was 
 a few coworkers actually deactivated their <unk> for a few weeks in <unk> that something similar would happen to them 
 then it really seemed like nothing happened and i was pretty <unk> but then my coworker who hates her way more than i do gleefully told me otherwise 
 so right after the event she took a vacation '' to texas 
 this vacation was really sudden considering we require three weeks notice for vacation 
 she 's also talks constantly so we hear about all of her plans months ahead of time 
 this one she did n't talk about at all 
 i found out the reason for her sudden vacation was that she was suspended for a little over a week but used the excuse of a vacation '' to cover it up and visited some friends of the family 
 she did n't tell a soul i guess she was really embarrassed but my coworker who hates her is very good friends with one of the higher up managers and found out 
 she does n't suspect me at all because i 'm such a sweet person outwardly even to her 
 she 's actually been even nicer to me lately than ever and even ran up and <unk> the hell out of me at work the other day out of nowhere 
 so maybe she learned her lesson 
 not too sure but it 's a happy ending in my books 
 this is a <unk> revenge 
 part is revenge on my behalf by someone else 
 the other part is not mine but it was <unk> by one of my clients who told me what he 'd done almost ten years later 
 i 've been in real estate in chicago actually <unk> and <unk> suburbs for nearly 20 years 
 so i 'm helping a guy sell his condo 
 the place was absolutely gorgeous 
 the guy was a general contractor bought it as a dump gutted it and turned it into a <unk> 
 what makes this even more entertaining is that the guy was <unk> years old 
 his wife died he sold his house bought the condo and figured he 'd die there 
 nope he ended up meeting some <unk> little <unk> year old <unk> and they were going to get married and live at her house 
 let 's call the seller mike 
 a guy who we will call big f # % king a % hole bfa comes to see the condo which is somewhat <unk> but it was severely over improved and i thought we could get that price 
 i did n't notice bfa 's appointment time when i went to visit mike for a signature on a price reduction 
 so i just happened to be there when bfa shows up 
 bfa shows up and does n't have an agent with him 
 this is a no-no but since i 'm there i walk him through 
 he mentions that he called his realtor because he saw my sign 
 so this was n't a property that his agent actually found for him 
 oh well whatever 
 he seems <unk> and leaves 
 mike drops the price to $ <unk> and wants $ 225,000 minimum because he does n't want to owe anything after closing 
 bfa 's agent calls me and says bfa wants to make an offer but she 's busy 
 she wants me to meet with her client to write up an offer 
 i point out the legal issues with this and she 's like i wo n't say anything if you do n't '' 
 i call my broker not the same one in the previous story i wrote and explain the situation 
 he asks his wife also a realtor to handle writing up the offer 
 illinois allows <unk> agency where i can help a buyer and seller at the same time for the same property but i ca n't do it for a realtor with another brokerage 
 after my broker 's wife gets done bfa tells her he 's having second thoughts and to hold off 
 during the next two weeks bfa shows up at mike 's condo seven times unannounced no appointment and has no realtor with him 
 mike is a nice guy and thinks he 's got a hot buyer so he lets the guy in to look around measure write notes take pictures etc 
 i had no idea this was going on or i would have put a stop to it 
 anyway bfa talks to mike who 's ready to move 
 bfa says he knows mike only bought it for $ 100,000 three years earlier 
 mike tells the guy that the lowest he 's going is $ 225,000 because he took out a construction loan and put about $ 100,000 into the <unk> remodel with high end materials and appliances 
 i 'm not kidding 
 the place was spectacular 
 3 bedroom 3 bath living room huge <unk> 's kitchen wet bar <unk> <unk> formal dining room <unk> ceilings family room loft and every room was wired for phone cable surround sound and internet which was a relatively new thing at the time 
 mike also showed bfa the net sheet i gave him which showed that at $ 225,000 mike would walk away with $ <unk> 
 bfa calls his realtor who calls me to have me make the offer that my broker 's wife wrote up 
 however bfa calls my broker 's wife and tells her to lower the offer from $ <unk> to $ <unk> because that old man can afford to bring a hundred bucks to closing '' 
 the way the numbers work based on the net sheet and market time mike still would have walked away with a few bucks 
 i get the offer from my broker 's wife and she tells me to enjoy the little gift and i 'm not taking anything away '' i 'll explain this later 
 i present the offer to mike and mike tells me to just hold onto it because he has another appointment scheduled and wants to see if they 'll make an offer 
 they do n't but mike waits anyway 
 at this point bfa has <unk> him multiple times and gave a low i 'm gon na screw this old man so he walks away with nothing '' offer after having a very frank discussion 
 bfa is calling every day to ask about his offer 
 i can tell that he loves it 
 his agent 
 nowhere to be found 
 never got a call from her 
 finally 3 weeks later bfa 's calls have gone from innocent inquiry to angry screaming 
 no there 's no time limit on illinois real estate contracts unless you put one in and he did n't 
 mike finally signs off because he feels bad for me 
 he would have left bfa hanging another 3 weeks if he did n't feel bad about me having to deal with the calls 
 bfa does his inspection and tries to renegotiate 
 mike tells him to drop dead since mike is a general contractor and knows the work is done to code despite what bfa 's inspector said 
 by the way bfa 's inspector was a friend of his 
 bfa still moves forward 
 bfa drags his feet with his bank and the closing keeps getting pushed back 
 mike is pissed at bfa 
 finally we close 
 instead of being in a room together mike and bfa are in separate rooms because they hate each other at this point and no one wants an explosion 
 bfa tries to renegotiate at the closing 
 mike literally yells he wants $ 100 because i do n't have low flow toilets 
 i 'll give him $ 100 but i 'm going to jam it up his ass to my fucking elbow '' 
 i do n't know if bfa heard it but i would have loved to have seen the look on his face 
 now the revenge had on my behalf ... the closer comes in near the end and says jane doe from xyz realty called to tell me to send her commission check to her office ... i do n't see that she 's getting a check '' 
 i give her a copy of the contract and <unk> and show her what my broker 's wife added to it ... not only did she have him sign an exclusive buyer broker agreement naming her as his designated agent she also got him to write and sign in his own handwriting i inquired about this property because i saw myzyri 's sign 
 my agent did n't <unk> me when myzyri showed me the unit 
 broker 's wife <unk> my offer '' 
 this basically showed that the other realtor did n't do her job so i was n't paying her 
 buyer 's realtors are paid part of the seller 's agent 's commission 
 so i explained all this and on the advice of the seller 's attorney i <unk> my commission statement to give the other realtor a $ 50 <unk> fee 
 she <unk> the check and called for weeks demanding her money 
 the chicago association of realtors reviewed her case and told her to get lost 
 as a side note many years later i saw that she had her license <unk> for multiple ethics violations 
 and now mike 's revenge ... about ten years later mike 's new wife died and he called me to sell that house because he was going to move into an <unk> living <unk> 
 while talking with mike he told me about the things he did before leaving the condo 
 the fans had no chains or switches 
 they were <unk> with remote <unk> 
 he taped the <unk> to the tops of the fan blades and turned them on high before leaving the last time 
 he removed the super high quality garbage disposal that was super quiet and installed the cheapest and <unk> one he could fine 
 he shut off all the water valves for the sinks and toilets 
 he poured straight bleach in the toilet <unk> 
 he claims that will destroy the <unk> in the toilet tank or at least <unk> reduce the life <unk> 
 he put water <unk> in the showers 
 he removed the wheels from the <unk> of the sliding glass doors and left them in a kitchen drawer assuming bfa would just throw them out assuming they were junk 
 he turned the little <unk> on the <unk> for the attached grill so they would n't create a <unk> 
 he disconnected the <unk> on the oven 
 he did n't break it he just loosened the connection 
 i think there were a few other things but i ca n't remember what they were 
 he said he got a nasty letter from bfa 's attorney about the doors oven and grill demanding to be paid for the service calls for the repairs 
 he ignored it and never heard anything else about it 
 tl dr : lazy realtor does n't do her job but still <unk> to get paid a $ <unk> commission 
 she <unk> up with a $ 50 <unk> fee because she did n't involve herself in any step of the transaction 
 jerky buyer <unk> off a seller who gets revenge by doing annoying things before leaving the condo for the last time 
 i guess you could say this <unk> the line of petty and pro 
 you be the judge 
 so years ago i moved to the city with no job 
 being as young as i was finding a job was pretty hard 
 i asked my uncle if he could find me something at the auto dealership he worked at 
 i found my way into the lube bay 
 oil changes and basic <unk> 
 i started in the summer and man was it hot 
 hot engines hot oil and just general <unk> 
 but as much as i felt like i was in hell i would not let that affect my work 
 i was more than a lube tech 
 i was an a <unk> 
 if it was busy i would make sure every last thing was done 
 new filter <unk> all <unk> mats record your tire <unk> depth and <unk> your tires if need be 
 if it was slow i would go above and beyond 
 wash the inside of your windows wash your wheels blow out your air filters 
 overall i felt like i was a pretty solid worker and did my job how i would want it done myself 
 all customers are different and unique 
 some are appreciative awesome 
 some could care less most people 
 some are picky not many though 
 and some are just plain horrible 
 this is a story about the latter 
 this woman drove a purple <unk> and we shall call her mv 
 mv came in my first week 
 it was rather slow and a grease-ball i work with asked me if i would take mv so that he could go home early 
 grease-ball loved to go home early and i loved making more money 
 so i said yeah no prob grease-ball '' 
 a <unk> pulls the van up to my pit and i crank out all the engine stuff 
 new oil new filter top off fluids and go through my whole check sheet 
 done no prob 
 now off to clean the car i notice its dirty as i 'm putting on new gloves open then door and it hits me 
 this bitch smelt like a hot asshole on a humid summer day in the <unk> of <unk> 
 there were 2 car seats that were <unk> by half eaten <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 the floors were trashed 
 juice bottles milk shakes cereal everywhere 
 shall i go on 
 ok an empty cd case and <unk> dvds scattered abroad 
 <unk> with god knows what on them 
 <unk> chinese food 
 dirty <unk> diapers 
 candy that had become part of the interior 
 mcdonald 's bags stuffed with garbage 
 and maybe even part of a dead horse 
 i 'm not even sure 
 so i tough it out and do my whole routine 
 dvds back in the case 
 dirty clothes bagged up garbage emptied floors <unk> as well as i could 
 and car washed 
 i even got the inside windows 
 done and good riddance 
 by far the worst vehicle i had in my first month 
 flash forward a few months 
 its busy as hell and we are short staffed as its lunchtime 
 my next car pulls up and would n't you know it 
 it belongs to mv 
 same purple van 
 same smell 
 same mess 
 and i had to do it 
 so i 'm putting in my new mileage sticker the one we put in the corner of your windshield so you know when you should get your next oil change 
 and realize that has only been <unk> miles since last change 
 now we all tell you to change oil every 3000 miles but that is just a big scam to get money from you guys 
 sorry but its true 
 most cars on the road today could go <unk> miles or more before they need a change 
 but if you knew that auto shops would loose a huge chunk of business 
 so i go over to my service manager and ask him why they need an oil change 
 it 's only been <unk> 
 i plead the oil is still good 
 he informs me that mv claimed that i had not changed her filter and that i was going to receive a warning later which could lead to termination if i could n't correct that error in service 
 that got me steamed 
 literally 
 i always changed oil filters 
 i had heard stories of cheap lube places and how they would not change an oil filter to increase store profit 
 but that is n't me 
 i mean like wow 
 so what ever 
 i 'm steamed but i know after i finish this one i will be on lunch 
 so i crank it out and clean it up 
 just like i do for all my customers and just like i did last time for mv 
 the next hour of leisure was well deserved 
 flash forward a few months and mv is back 
 she is on a service plan and gets scheduled oil changes every 6 months 
 i guess the last one was free too because of some <unk> or something 
 well a new guy gets mv and i <unk> with him as he gets the first <unk> of <unk> new winter smell 
 while he is changing the oil i told him to make sure to change the filter 
 and i gave him a paint pen to mark it with 
 we will sometimes mark your filter with a <unk> 
 putting a <unk> of paint on your filter and engine 
 that way we can tell if it has been tampered with since your last visit 
 i help him make a note of that in our system 
 so that we can see it but the customer cant 
 i had a hunch she would be back 
 and would n't you know it 
 1500 miles later it was back and it was my duty 
 once again 
 talk with our service manager show him the note and the <unk> 
 he goes off to inform mv that the filter was changed and that she would not be getting another service until 3000 miles 
 but before i returned the vehicle to her i had to mess with her a little 
 i ever so carefully popped open a <unk> of her dashboard and threw a screw in there 
 and put the dash back in place 
 at 3000 miles mv was back but this time she went to a mechanic because she needed to get a strange rattling noise checked out 
 so i went over to the mechanic whom i got along pretty well with 
 i told him about our history with her as well as the screw 
 and he got a pretty big kick out of that 
 i asked him to tell mv that it would take a lot of time for that 
 as well as ordering some new parts 
 total cost was about 200 $ more than the free oil changed that she had accused me into doing 
 best part was the tech told me he wiped off the old filter really well and <unk> it 
 and for the first time mv really did n't get her filter changed 
 **tl dr** lady accused me of not changing her filter but i did 
 so i put a screw in her dashboard and she ended up paying to get the rattling noise <unk> of all this is a throwaway account 
 i 'm not from a english speaking country so for the nazis : take it easy 
 was told by a friend to tell this story here so here it goes 
 this happened six years ago : there had been a new biker gang <unk> in my home town there were already two other ones at that time but this new gang was being real jerks to normal people and they were annoying as shit 
 this gang had started harassing people at local bars and restaurants just showing of and trying to make a name of them self 
 a few weeks later and they had now started riding their loud bikes through the <unk> cunts as they are 
 about three to four times a week between 12am and about 1am 
 the police was contacted several times but nothing is changed 
 we in the neighborhood decided to take the matter in our own hands 
 we started talking to each other what we can do that wont hurt them just something so they will stay away 
 we started talking about putting out <unk> and parking our cars on the street blocking as much as possible but still make a hard to ride through making a <unk> like pattern 
 just so he would slow down bothered so he would n't come here any more 
 then we decided that a good old egging would sent a message 
 we talked to all the neighbors told them our plans 
 if they had have enough they should buy plenty of eggs and join us 
 the street i was living on was formed like a u '' with three apartment houses and about 40 apartments with the window and some <unk> to the street 
 we said that we would sit up and just wait for him to come have our windows open because you could hear him from a great distance 
 the first night he did n't come we tried the next one 
 about 0:30 am i hear him coming 
 the <unk> is rising this is it 
 he is finally entering our street 
 he sees the roadblock and slowly <unk> forward making as much noise as possible for the trouble we gave him 
 he takes the first obstacle and now the first apartments are starting to launch their eggs hitting him really good on the helmet and his bike 
 we blocked the road so much that if he wanted to turn around he would have to fully stop several times 
 so he just went forward faster thinking it would be over 
 not in this neighborhood he rode though a rain of at least 200 eggs 
 all soaked in eggs from head to bottom as well as his bike he was never to been seen in this area no more 
 victory 
 yes we got eggs on our cars to but it was worth not having to deal with them waking us up at night 
 tl dr : biker gang started making trouble in my neighborhood got in one little fight and and got all scared egged <unk> middle school i was n't the most popular guy out there in fact i was easy to pick on and admittedly a <unk> cat 
 i hate confrontation i was bullied my whole life since elementary school and even by my friends '' 
 well 7th grade year this guy named d for dick had grown accustomed to slamming my books out of hand or <unk> my backpack all the way so that my stuff would spill out pulling my pants down tripping me calling me names and the list can go on for days 
 well he liked to wait for me before my 4th block out side on the breezeway 
 he would pick on me then but he had started to get more violent 
 i remember to the day when he said im gone kill you you 're a fucking mexican 
 not even the cool ones 
 pussy '' 
 i said okay just leave me alone 
 im gon na be late to class '' then he said i bet you like cock you fag 
 you want to see it faggot 
 i know you do '' i said '' i really do n't want to see it i promise '' he then proceeded to <unk> his belt and act like it was his penis 
 i looked away and started to walk away but he threw my shit on the ground 
 i bent down to get it and he slapped me with on the head his belt and was like im gon na cum on you since you like gay shit '' 
 i head butted him in balls and ran off but i started to cry and pretended it never happened 
 fast forward two days 
 i had luckily been able to avoid him but i had to go the restroom during my technology lab block and so i went to the restroom 
 i go in to a stall and finish my business and as i 'm walking out he 's right there skipping class 
 i look down and go to the sink to wash my hands but he notices me 
 he pushes me slowly against the wall and gets in my face 
 you thought it was funny huh 
 hitting me in balls '' 
 i said no i was just tired of you calling me gay '' he proceeds to call me any word he can in order to call me gay 
 my eyes start to water and try and run away but again he grabs me says where you think you going fag '' he again <unk> his belt and starts to grab it like it 's his dick '' he pushes me to the ground as i 'm getting up he slaps me with his belt across the face 
 i pushed but he 's bigger and taller then me so it was pointless 
 he then proceeded to <unk> his pants and show me his dick 
 i just closed my eyes and turned around and crawled out of the restroom 
 i get to class and pretend nothing happened 
 later that day he walks by me and the hallway and yells out if i ever see you try and look at my dick in restroom again i 'm going to beat the shit out of you '' well everyone there heard it i looked down and pretend i did n't hear anything he said 
 the weekend goes by and i <unk> going back because i know ill see him again on tuesday in the hallway 
 tuesday comes and i see him waiting standing against a locker in the hallway 
 i was late to class by the way 
 he walks towards me and <unk> his chest out 
 i look down and he says trying to look again '' i just did n't say anything 
 he does the shit with his belt again and his pants were <unk> but this time i started to yell leave me the fuck alone '' 
 a teacher rushes out and sees him holding what looked to be his dick in his hand and rushes towards me 
 he says what in the world is going on '' 
 i say he 's flashing his dick at me and bullying me im crying and he wo n't leave me alone '' the teacher calls the principle and the assistant principle 
 i get taken to the counseling office he gets taken towards the <unk> office and is apparently put in handcuffs by the school cop 
 i did n't want them to tell my parents out of fear that i would get in trouble for not telling them 
 i see him a week later he had gotten expelled and was getting something from his teachers 
 he was being escorted by the principle and looking down 
 people liked him as he was seen as the cool kid but i was the loser mexican kid who had no friends 
 i got a lot of shit for getting him expelled by everyone but no one seemed to care what happened to me 
 *edit* im sorry for the grammar and any other mistakes 
 it was a lot harder to write than i ever imagined when i was 17 i was working in a local theater that i was told would be a sweet job for pocket money 
 turns out that it was anything but 
 i was in a handful of different positions in that place and i 'm not going to make myself out to be a miracle worker i did a good job sure but i made sure to have fun too 
 my immediate manager was pretty cool to boot 
 very laid back <unk> spoken and liked to talk politics and history 
 it was the upper management that gave everyone a hard time 
 the gm in particular was a piece of shit who loved to berate people 
 if he suspected you of a minor infraction he 'd nail you to the wall for it 
 anything bigger and you were gone 
 his second in command was no better either 
 she was a woman who dressed in flowing garments and looked <unk> every time she came into work 
 i did n't have many problems with them nor they with me in the opening stages of the working relationship 
 halfway in was when they really started hammering people myself included over dumb things 
 i had to stay late after school one day and it was a day off 
 i called them because i did n't have my schedule on hand to check and see when my next day in was 
 it was n't even the upper offices just the phone that goes straight to the areas i worked 
 second in command picks up the phone and upon hearing that i was asking for information that was literally printed right next to the phone she was using proceeded to berate me for not being prepared '' 
 i swallowed my pride disagreeing with it but taking it 
 surely she had a point and i should 've been <unk> with it 
 lapse on my part 
 so i shrug it off and let it go 
 i come in the next day and she makes a beeline for me fifteen minutes into my shift with a yellow piece of paper in her hand and a smarmy smile on her face 
 the <unk> had written me up 
 you are responsible for your own schedule 
 if this happens again you 're fired '' 
 i was fuming 
 this <unk> 
 all i did was ask for the next day i came in 
 i never had this problem anywhere else for the record 
 only here 
 so immediately after that i cared less and less about the job 
 every time we got berated and threatened with termination my <unk> dropped a little more 
 we were teenagers either still in high school or just out of it and they were paying us minimum wage 
 how much blood were they going to try and get out of this stone 
 i wish i could say it got better but it did n't 
 they would pass up minor tasks a piece of trash on the floor and approach an usher clear on the other side of the hallway or building and tell them to pick it up 
 they 'd promise <unk> and then deny them 
 they even began to deny discounts 
 it was n't long before everyone got tired of their shit 
 by this point i 'd had enough 
 i was going to do something 
 i just did n't know what yet 
 my favorite thing to do back in high school was stink bombs 
 i 'd crack them off in <unk> in classrooms 
 i never got caught 
 around this time the chronicles of <unk> was about to hit opening day and i had morning shift 
 management had big expectations for this one and anticipated a lot of business so i had my target 
 i thought about hitting the biggest auditorium in the place where i knew the movie would be aired and then caught myself 
 those little <unk> would get cracked the rotten egg smell would <unk> then go away in thirty seconds ... and everyone would know it was me 
 i needed something lasting 
 something with a lot more staying power than 30 seconds 
 what i ended up getting was a <unk> of liquid ass 
 i did n't need nine bottles but this was when i was a kid and had all the money in the world to spend on stupid things 
 it showed up one day before the big event which had me sweating bullets because i really wanted to do this and was worried about them coming too late 
 when they finally came in the mail <unk> i was jubilant 
 i was ready to do my dirty deeds 
 i had my uniform on dressed for another day on the job with two white vials of liquid ass in a <unk> pocket 
 as we were about to open ten minutes before we unlocked the doors two <unk> acted as <unk> while i snuck into the biggest auditorium in the house 
 i was correct in assuming they would choose this one for prince caspian 
 the carpeted walls acted as the perfect vehicle for the foul substance transparent and silent as it <unk> out of the squirt tip 
 i hit the back corridor under the seats and both <unk> leading up <unk> with the upper row 
 i expected a good lasting effect since i 'd hit the <unk> of such a massive room 
 it really started to work as i was walking out and i got blasted with the stuff as it began to <unk> 
 i will never forget that stink 
 it <unk> me 
 as opposed to the stink bombs and the <unk> odor i was accustomed to this was in a league entirely of its own 
 the <unk> of the stench was something that took me aback and introduced me to a new world of <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 it perfectly <unk> its namesake : an open ass crack 
 satisfied i walked out counting on the putrid smell to do its job 
 i had two minutes to spare 
 no one would sit in there for an hour and a half 
 a <unk> worker had asked what was going on and we told him because we knew he was n't going to open his mouth 
 he got curious and started slowly towards the door 
 he did n't get very far 
 he could n't even open the door without it hitting him 
 his hands flew over his face with a <unk> groan 
 i got back to work so that i was n't suspicious and i had a clear vantage point 
 i would not be able to follow people inside but i would be able to watch them leave 
 we unlock the doors and people come in 
 here 's where i feel guilty : some of them were parents bringing kids along 
 i leaned over the counter and watched people barrel in and then barrel out 
 our management crew was on the scene in minutes offering up <unk> and refunds along with a weak <unk> agent 
 they expected sales to go up <unk> thanks to prince caspian 
 this fell through and a <unk> immediately ensued 
 not wanting my pocket to tip off a manager that something may have been inside i stuffed them inside trash and buried it in other things that needed to be thrown away 
 the <unk> smell <unk> and lasted six days before they finally got rid of it 
 when they did i quit 
 tl dr : i liquid <unk> prince <unk> i had a friend '' in the 3rd grade 
 we 'll call him chad 
 chad always liked to borrow things from me because at the time my family was fairly well off 
 not once but twice he lent out what i lent him and both times the second hand borrowers lost '' these items 
 once with a football and once with an nes game 
 one day i 'm out taking pictures with my new $ 300 camera and chad wants to borrow it 
 normally i would have told him to kick rocks but i had a plan to exact my revenge so i let him borrow it 
 <unk> for him i 've been making friends '' with the person he <unk> out my things to yes every time it 's the same guy 
 so i 'm at the guy 's house a few days later and per usual he 's loaned out my camera to this guy 
 i know because i see it on his shelf and as a bonus i see my nes game peeking out from beneath his bed 
 never found my football though ... so anyway as his mom calls to him and as he leaves the room i swipe my nes game and my camera and shove them quickly into my <unk> 
 as he comes back i tell him i have to go and made up some lame excuse 
 the very next day i make a show of asking chad where my camera is because i want it back and again he makes a story about how he loaned it out and the second hand <unk> lost '' it 
 at this point i figured either he was selling my stuff to the guy or the guy was stealing it 
 either way i could n't care less 
 this time i made a <unk> 
 i acted like i was fed up and i stomped right down to his house to tell his dad what he did 
 come to find out dad was saving up to buy chad a brand new <unk> but ended up paying a good chunk of what he saved to me because of the camera his son lost '' 
 he was also grounded for a month and heard the belt smack him across the ass as i walked down the street 
 so i got my nes game back as well as my camera and a $ 300 asshole tax from his dad 
 he never asked to borrow from me again 
 tl dr : asshole kid keeps lending out my stuff and ultimately getting it stolen so i lend him my expensive camera swipe it from the guy he inevitably loans it to and have his dad pay to replace <unk> changed to protect identities of all friends involved 
 when i was 19 all my close friends were at a college 3 hours away from our hometown 
 my plan was to attend the local junior college and then transfer after two years to the same college as them 
 5 of my close friends had rented a 4 bedroom apartment 3 months in advance the good apartments get booked early 
 it was 2 couples and my bro who was single : chandler and monica rachel and ross and joey 
 well rachel and ross broke up over the summer 
 2 weeks into the fall semester ross could n't take being around rachel anymore so he moved out 
 chandler calls me and asks me to move in 
 he is like dude just work down here until you are considered a resident then go to the junior college down here becoming a resident would save me a lot of money on tuition 
 joey started telling me about all the hot college chicks down there and i was really missing my friends so i went for it 
 my father found me a good paying job through his work and i moved in 
 life was good for a long time 
 i worked all day and <unk> with my friends at night 
 at the start of the spring semester our friend <unk> transferred to the college and got a 2 bedroom apartment down the street 
 <unk> and rachel were really close 
 so rachel moved in with her and found a replacement named marcel 
 marcel was our new roommate and was a friend of a friend 
 rachel 's friend had met him in <unk> for heroin 
 marcel seemed cool enough and was clean 
 he was a little wild and crazy 
 he liked to play the bongo drums but we were used to loud music 
 joey was a dj and would play loud music all the time 
 a few weeks go by and marcel started becoming a bad roommate 
 he would n't clean up after himself 
 he would stay up to like 6 am and eat all our food 
 he drank way too much and would leave our apartment in <unk> 
 we would talk to him about it and he would get better 
 but he would always <unk> to being a shitty roommate after a couple weeks 
 then i lost my job a job that paid well 
 suddenly i needed to find full time work in a college town 
 it was impossible because every restaurant or store could just hire part time college kids 
 so after a couple of weeks i had to start doing double shifts at a day labor company 
 if you are not familiar with day labor it basically sucks 
 you make minimum wage and they pay you in cash at the end of the day 
 the jobs <unk> from garbage man to factory worker 
 the majority of <unk> were homeless people 
 i would show up at 5 am and work until 8 pm 
 this is when marcel and i start to have real problems 
 i would ask him to keep it down 
 i was really reasonable about it 
 you could play loud music and not wake me up 
 but marcel was playing music at the full volume of our stereo 
 luckily we only had a month on the lease before we would move out and not have to live with marcel 
 i had a car and would frequently drive other <unk> to the job site 
 that’s how i met gunther who was hitchhiking across country and working on the same job as me 
 we got along right away 
 plus he was 22 and could buy us beer 
 so i offered up our couch as a place to stay while he earned enough money to travel to his next destination 
 i told him about marcel and asked him to help keep it quiet at night 
 monica chandler joey and i were very chill people 
 gunther was the exact opposite 
 gunther had a <unk> fuck with <unk> personality and was a big dude 
 i am <unk> and pretty strong he was just as tall but way bigger than me 
 i brought him to the apartment and introduced him to chandler monica and joey as our new stereo <unk> 
 it totally worked too 
 marcel didn’t pull any max volume stereo shenanigans at 4 am 
 a few weeks went by and it was great 
 finally we had to move 
 gunther and i had pulled a double shift during the day 
 it was about 11 pm when i went to bed in order to be ready to move in the morning 
 gunther chandler and monica decide to get a late night snack together 
 about a half an hour goes by when marcel comes home drunk as fuck 
 he turns the volume up all the way on the stereo and starts dancing in the living room 
 joey comes out of his bedroom with a get a load of the balls on this guy look on his face 
 i had enough so i just go out in the living room and <unk> all the wires connecting our dope ass sound system 
 it was <unk> and we had to <unk> everything tomorrow anyways so fuck it 
 marcel is talking mad shit the whole time 
 i just ignore him and go back to bed 
 about 10 minutes later he starts playing his bongo drums as loud as possible 
 i had forgotten about them 
 so i go out there and am like shut the fuck up 
 marcel starts taking off his shirt and pants 
 he is screaming <unk> fight let’s go <unk> over and over 
 i tell him to fuck off and he grabs me by my collar 
 i basically just fall on him and proceed to pin him on the ground 
 marcel is screaming and talking shit the whole time while i pin him to the ground with joey laughing his ass off 
 gunther chandler and monica walk in looking completely shocked 
 gunther is like <unk> i will beat his <unk> i am like <unk> just throw him <unk> we then proceed to throw him out the front door in nothing but his boxers 
 we lock the door and he is just screaming the whole time to let him back in 
 eventually the cops come and we explain the whole situation 
 they tell marcel that we don’t have to let him back in and he needs to leave 
 we wake up and starting moving our stuff 
 marcel doesn’t show up in the morning 
 we realize we have to move all his stuff out 
 i take his bongo drums down 2 flights of stairs and leave them on the lawn 
 then i am like fuck this bullshit let’s just throw his stuff off the balcony 
 it was like a magical <unk> of falling boxes <unk> jeans and t-shirts 
 marcel finally shows up when we are finished 
 his mom was driving in to help him move back home but she wasn’t coming until tomorrow 
 he begs us to keep his stuff in the apartment but we just tell him to fuck off 
 he then starts hiding his stuff behind a bush next to the building and then leaves 
 now this is a college town which was pretty dirty all year round with lots of beer cans and litter everywhere 
 so the apartment complex was cleaned only once a year and that was today 
 so a 12 man cleaning crew came and threw everything he owned into the dumpster with all the other trash on the streets 
 we saw marcel digging through the garbage the next day with his mom 
 tldr <unk> is something i would never do again but something that i did in <unk> when i was furious 
 a girl call her c i knew was raped 
 another girl call her m was always mean to her and to my group of friends in general 
 this girl bullied anyone who would n't retaliate 
 she slept with girls boyfriends she faked being a lesbian and led a girl on for as long as she could for the attention and went after c at every chance she could get 
 so one day when it was known that c was raped and m walked up and told her she was faking the whole thing 
 that the whole story was a lie and that no one would want to rape someone like c. i was n't personally there but when i found out i was furious 
 i had a couple of friends that were younger and being only slightly in my circle of friends anyways i figured i would n't be a suspect 
 i gathered my other scattered friends and told them m 's name 
 i mentioned that she did something to wrong a good person and that she deserved whatever they could come up with 
 the rumors started about <unk> she slept around a lot so having an std was <unk> 
 no one would sleep with her anymore 
 this was the only big rumor 
 it ended her ego 
 her friends even believed it 
 i should mention that one of the boys she slept with frequently while he was dating another friend of mine had <unk> 
 it worked 
 she left c alone and went into her own little world of drama 
 everyone knew one of us did it or started it but i kept my mouth shut 
 no one knew about my friends or about what i started 
 i never heard anything about it again until recently 
 she is still having trouble trying to get a boyfriend 
 apparently they want her tested before they go any farther 
 every one of them 
 this was a terrible thing to do 
 i know this but i got my revenge and c got better without any trouble and no one got physically hurt 
 all i did was ruin her reputation 
 a couple of years ago i had a really shitty co-worker 
 we worked in it and he was a really bad programmer but thought he was amazing 
 he would add his own <unk> that all connections to the database would go through and then decided to do changes in production without telling anybody making our stuff malfunction because of his <unk> 
 even worse whenever something that he fucked up did go wrong and somebody complained he looked around the room to see who was n't there and blamed that person 
 this went on for years and we tried getting the manager to do something about it but nothing happened 
 he also bullied the rest of the it staff on a daily basis and was rude to pretty much anyone not a manager 
 after five years of putting up with his shit we threatened to leave the company if he was n't fired 
 all 7 of us programmers <unk> <unk> everyone gave the same ultimatum to the manager 
 fire him or we all resign on monday morning 
 he was fired that day 
 but wait - the revenge does n't end there 
 a couple of years later i wrote a series of sick humor books the kind of thing you do n't want your name attached to 
 when i wrote the first one i thought about what author name to use 
 i decided to use the name of my asshole former co-worker ... now when you google his name you find four pages of amazon pages for his '' books reviews of them google image search returns his face surrounded by copies of my books 
 the best thing is - i 'm making a living selling books in his name 
 i did actually change the spelling of his name slightly so it 's not the exact same 
 google still returns the books when you search for his name <unk> 've been lurking for awhile and i finally have a story that i think fits with this subreddit 
 i debated whether it should go here or on <unk> but due to the <unk> ending i decided to post it here 
 allow me to start off by saying i 'm recently homeless 
 i 'm not going to go into a whole sob story about it but i have shitty credit so nowhere in town will rent to me without a roommate i have no friends who need roommates and i sunk all of my money into rent and deposits on a series of unlivable roommate matching situations 
 i 've been at the local homeless shelter for a little over two weeks 
 i 'm a <unk> early 20 's female who looks younger than i am so i have this very <unk> vibe about me 
 i met a lot of the people here and got along with most of them but primarily bonded with a small group of about 4 people a <unk> married couple and a former drug lord trying to get his life on the right track 
 i was friendly with everyone else too though including this girl in a wheelchair missing one leg 
 little did i know that she would soon be known to me only as rollercunt and the series of events that would <unk> as a result of this <unk> trash bag 
 before this all happened i liked to buy nice things for myself 
 i dress in the latest <unk> own a somewhat recent model laptop had a <unk> before i had to sell it for food and until a week ago a nice several hundred dollar phone as well 
 i made the mistake of leaving it next to the toilet in the bathroom one time while i was in a hurry yes i am well aware that it is a bad idea to leave things in bathrooms i do n't need to hear it for a <unk> time this week and within the 10 minutes it took me to realize i had left it it had <unk> rollercunt was very vocal about i ca n't believe someone would steal her phone whoever did it give it back '' 
 while i cried in the corner over the fact that i had just began the hiring process for a new job and now had no way of contacting the company i hoped to work for to acquire necessary paperwork 
 however upon reviewing the surveillance footage from the hall outside the bathroom rollercunt was the only person in there between when i left it and when i went back to look for it 
 later in the day she came back drunk with a guilty conscious told me she had found my phone ditched between the shelter and bus stop but had accidentally left it in her friend 's car and would bring it back the next day 
 the next day came and her addiction won out 
 she changed her story and said it was a different brand of phone than the one i had then went and sold it for $ 50 to drink more 
 not long after they caught her on camera stealing cash and cigarettes from someone else and every day from then on they caught her on video stealing something else leaving quickly after and coming back with a pocket full of cash and a bottle of booze 
 stealing is supposed to get the perpetrator banned but they take pity and let her stay because she 's a cripple 
 as far as i 'm concerned she 's a lying thief first and a disabled individual second and should not get special treatment for missing a leg 
 but let 's continue ... after coming back from selling the phone she asked to buy a cigarette off of me 
 i keep multiple packs on me so i can sell individual smokes for a quarter each and i needed bus money so i agreed 
 she handed me a <unk> and i told her i could n't sell her one for that the price was <unk> and not <unk> 
 she started going off about how i would n't sell her a cigarette this is what she gets for her honesty 
 i snapped 
 then where the fuck is the phone bitch 
 i know you took it the police came and reviewed the video feed today and saw you going in after me and you want to talk about honesty 
 she looked busted as fuck but tried to deny the police had even been there they had been before wheeling her ass out of the building as quickly as possible and disappearing for awhile 
 never long enough though 
 rollercunt did n't like being called out on her shit so she took to wheeling by me and calling me an ugly slut on a multiple times daily basis 
 i ignored it for awhile since i 'm aware that i 'm attractive to many people she looks exactly as you would expect a chronic drunk to look haggard as fuck and she regularly fucks a rotating cast of guys here in public areas <unk> i do n't see anyone here like that 
 after about half a week of it though i decided it was going to end one way or another 
 i was sitting in my usual corner watching <unk> with my headphones in right before lunchtime 
 people started <unk> into the dining area so i started <unk> down my laptop to pack away and go eat 
 when i started closing everything out that makes sound i saw her roll by and heard her call me a slut 
 i explained for the <unk> time what the word slut '' actually means and how she 's confused about which of us it applies to and she starts wheeling around yelling like she wants to fight 
 i stood up and asked her if she was going to do something or just keep running her mouth and she <unk> up in front of me real fast still running her mouth 
 i did n't realize it at the time but rollercunt actually made the first move 
 dumb bitch thought she was going to stand up on her one leg and fight me 
 i grabbed her by the hair pulled her the rest of the way up and threw her out of the chair 
 one of her friends we 'll call him tweak because he 's a <unk> pushed a pile of mats stacked next to us over in an attempt to have them land on me but had n't realized i stood up out of the way 
 they did cause me to lose my balance though so we landed with me sitting with my back against the wall and her entire body in my lap 
 i punched her in the face repeatedly with one hand while ripping out chunks of hair with the other 
 a staff member finally got us to stop i sat there in a <unk> for a few seconds i do n't normally just up and start beating on people and she was laying across my lap crying you pulled my hair ... '' 
 i looked at her like she was a piece of shit stuck to my shoe and kicked her off my lap her body <unk> rolling across the floor 
 the staff separated us i continued to sit quietly in my corner and wait for police while she continued sobbing she pulled my hair ... <unk> she pulled my hair ... '' 
 the police came and i remained calm and polite while explaining the situation truthfully 
 they ended up arresting tweak because he had several outstanding warrants 
 rollercunt was asked to leave the shelter for the rest of the day 
 what i think is the best part of the entire revenge is the police decided not to punish me 
 i did n't go to jail i did n't get a citation they did n't set a court date nothing 
 i 'm not proud that i had to beat on a cripple but i did what needed to be done and the fact that i did n't get in trouble for it gives me some sort of pride 
 oh and another upside to the whole situation the fight happened yesterday and nobody has had anything stolen from them <unk> to /u/_tixcy_ for submitting this story originally 
 i thought it was too good not to share 
 first post update thank you thank you thank you to everyone for all your awesome ideas on how to catch this bitch 
 seriously 
 there was a ton of replies and i had to get up early because i was working for another girl this morning so i did n't have much time to respond to everyone 
 for <unk> yes i know i have a shitty manager 
 no big secret most of us hate her but we ca n't fire her 
 we 're not corporate either 
 so it 's pretty much her + the owner who run things and he 's not around much 
 another thing yes ashley makes $ 13 an hour 
 i 'm not a business owner so i do n't know exactly how it works but 1/3 of her income is cash 
 from what i understand to get around paying overtime and health insurance the owner pays out the kitchen staff <unk> and dishwashers in cash so it looks like no one is working 40+ hours a week 
 also ashley makes $ 13 an hour to pick up plates and put them in a cart 
 she does n't wash the dishes 
 we have another guy who does that 
 she also does n't even work close to 40 hours a week so i 'm not sure why her entire check is n't reported but that 's just how it is 
 yes we 're in deep shit with the irs 
 no use reporting it they already know 
 anyway 
 so i called another server nicole last night and just flat out told her everything i 'd written here 
 she started crying and said she suspected someone was doing it but ashley was always such a <unk> and she could n't believe she would do that 
 she did n't deny ashley doing it just that she felt like ashley had stabbed her in the back over it 
 apparently ashley borrowed '' $ 200 from that server a few months ago because she claimed her parents were going to turn her phone off and she felt bad for her 
 so she 's stealing and getting money from her too 
 nicole said she 'd handle it so i figured she meant she 'd talk to the manager since they 're on pretty good terms 
 when i got to work ashley was already there 
 i made sure to grab any tips off my tables before she <unk> them and breakfast went okay 
 when we switched to lunch nicole came over and said hey table # 11 left me $ 12 there 's a ten and two ones '' 
 she said it really flatly and then was like see '' 
 and pointed at it 
 by then the table was long gone had already paid and ashley just needed to bus it 
 cool 
 as soon as we saw ashley go toward that section nicole & amp i walked behind the server line where we could see her 
 we clearly saw ashley <unk> the $ 10 underneath a plate pick the plate up toss it in the cart and then dump it in her apron pockets 
 she left the $ 2 on the table 
 nicole just said okay that 's that then and called the manager over 
 we told her everything about my tips about my friend losing tips and how nicole had noticed it too 
 my manager said basically what i had about maybe a customer did it and then we told her how that table had left $ 12 ashley took the $ 10 and left the $ 2 
 manager called ashley over and asked her to empty her pockets 
 all she had was the $ 10 in her apron 
 <unk> 
 ashley started crying could n't believe we 'd accuse her of stealing but my manager sided with us and gave the money back to nicole 
 ashley then decided the only way out of the situation was to make up some huge story about it 
 she said the table came over to her told her what a great job she was doing and told her they 'd left a $ 10 on the table for her 
 at least my manager was n't stupid enough to believe that 
 manager pulled her into the office and i assume told her she was fired because she came back out crying and grabbed her stuff and left 
 unfortunately neither of us have a record of what 's been stolen because we do n't know all of it but i told my manager about the guys from friday and how they usually leave me $ 60 and the table from the other day 
 manager said since we did n't have proof of all of it she did n't want to take it out of what she needed to pay ashley 
 said she 'd call the owner and ask what he wanted to do about it plus she did n't have proof aside from my word basically that those guys would have left me $ 60 
 it sucked but i understand that i guess 
 when my shift ended my manager asked me to come in the office and said the owner told her to go ahead and give me $ 100 to make up for it '' and that he was sorry and thanked us for telling them about it 
 not gon na complain about that because that definitely covers what i think ashley 's taken from me since i have n't work with her in so long 
 i know nicole works with her more so i 'm not sure what they plan to do about that but she does n't really have any proof or any way to calculate how much she 's lost from it 
 <unk> ... fortunately my manager acted like a decent human being for once and actually managed a situation 
 did n't have to mark any bills or get any customers involved thank god so i 'm pretty happy with how it turned out 
 i 'm not really sure how far you 're supposed to go in a situation like that but i hope ashley does n't get a job somewhere else and try to fuck people over 
 and nicole talked to the manager about borrowing $ 200 to ashley and the manager said she was going to call her parents when she got off that night and tell them what had happened 
 i realize it 's not really the managers job to get money back on a personal loan like that but i hope for nicole 's sake that ashley 's parents will offer to pay her back or something 
 <unk> edit : this is n't my story folks the credit belongs to /u/_tixcy_ <unk> 'm a pretty decent guy 
 sometimes i see ads on craigslist for people who need small loans and i help them out 
 it is always a 0 % loan but they need to provide good collateral 
 so i met this guy we can call him dave 
 he needs $ 300 and i agree to loan it to him 
 he has a hard time coming up with collateral 
 he gives me an <unk> keyboard an iphone a digital camera a silver necklace and a seahawks jersey 
 i tell him before he signs the loan document that i made up that he needs to decide now if he is actually going to pay me back he will regret not paying me back 
 i make that very clear to him 
 he agrees and i give him the money and he goes on his merry way i keep his stuff 
 my first mistake was taking collateral that really was n't worth $ 300 but i was feeling generous and was bored with life and needed an adventure 
 he had told me that the iphone was a <unk> but it turns out it was a 4 so that was even worth less 
 it was also still attached to his account that was in default so it was only worth parts 
 bummer i should have been more careful when checking that out i know better 
 so that two weeks pass and he is supposed to pay me back 
 he says he ca n't come up with the money and is willing to pay the $ 50 late fee that we had built into the contract 
 i agree and again warn him that not paying back wo n't work out well for him 
 after a month he is now in default '' and needs to pay me back 
 he starts coming up with excuses 
 of course he uses the oldest one in the book my dad died and i have to pay for the funeral '' 
 ok '' i say calling his bluff i 'm sorry for your loss i want to help out if you can give me some proof of his death then i 'll forgive the loan '' 
 of course he ca n't do that and promises he will still pay me back 
 a few more weeks go by and it is obvious he is n't going to pay me back and is completely ignoring me 
 so i start selling his stuff 
 i get $ 45 for the jersey $ 30 for the necklace and had the keyboard stolen from my car 
 but then that cell phone 
 he had n't bothered deleting his data 
 so i start texting his family asking about his dead dad 
 of course magically he contacts me right away again with excuses 
 this time it was in my grief i was so angry that i broke my phone just got a new one today '' 
 i tell him that he needs to pay me back and at this point he refuses 
 so my next step is i text his ex-girlfriend 
 i ask her if she would have any need for dave 's phone 
 she gets pretty excited and asks if there is any proof of him doing drugs in the last year 
 i find some texts about buying drugs and a picture of him smoking <unk> 
 i take screen shots and stuff and she tells me she needs that for their custody battle 
 after that i dig deeper into his data 
 he 's got a current girlfriend a really cute girl 
 way out of his league 
 but apparently he is also contacting <unk> and <unk> on craigslist has an ashley madison account and a plenty of fish account 
 so guess who gets an anonymous tip about his bad behavior 
 you guessed it the current girlfriend 
 she freaks out and wants all the info i can give her 
 on top of all his cheating half of the collateral was either stolen from her or was a gift from her 
 she even told me that he kept lying about the seahawks jersey that she had just given him for a birthday saying he left it as a friends house 
 next thing i know i 'm checking his facebook account and he has been kicked out of their apartment and he 's now back living with his parents like the loser he is 
 i end up keeping the cell phone for a while and then replacing the <unk> with a good one and selling it 
 i send him this picture in an email with the <unk> this is all it took to break up you and your girlfriend i told you that you would regret not paying me back 
 was she worth $ 300 '' 
 tl : dr guy would n't pay back $ 300 loan 
 i got his gf to break up with him 
 <unk> : relationship story ahead 
 * i usually pass on interpersonal drama stories but since i have one i 'm sharing mine just in case it 's somebody else 's cup of tea 
 skip the next paragraph if you 're already familiar with borderline personality disorder 
 * backstory * i once dated a guy with borderline personality disorder 
 i had never heard of that disorder before and he certainly did n't disclose it while we were together but i slowly learned all about it over the course of my time spent with him 
 if you do n't know the type he was very intense : i felt like we packed three years of relationship into 9 months of dating 
 he had to always be doing something new because sitting still was <unk> 
 he was emotionally <unk> but due to being an attractive <unk> he made friends easily and quickly but usually only maintained them so he could <unk> them later 
 he was the master of manipulating the emotions of others so that you 'd do anything he wanted 
 he had a perfect memory and this ability to twist around my own memories of events so that even i could n't remember what <unk> happened 
 he lied about anything just to see if he could get away with it and he was narcissistic to top it all off 
 one thing i should say is that he was <unk> 
 and i mean he was stupidly ridiculously attractive but somehow was the most paranoid and insecure person i 'd ever met 
 i was young and naive and he was so insanely hot that i thought it was something of a miracle that he was even into me in the first place 
 the sex was <unk> but he started to use that against me over time too 
 i did a lot of things i 'm very ashamed of 
 as an example of how stupid i was he managed to get me to let '' him hook up with other women but of course he would get so completely jealous if one of my male friends even vaguely appeared to be hitting on me 
 he called me a whore and slut and insinuated that i did the most horrifically dirty things to men behind his back when he was n't around 
 i was in my senior year of university at the time so i did a <unk> of studying on campus with my peers 
 he could n't stand it 
 he ruined a lot of my <unk> and just when i was starting to see him for what he was he managed to get me addicted to several drugs from the <unk> scene that he had access to somehow 
 my <unk> was <unk> at the end of our relationship and i was completely dependant on him for any sort of <unk> or <unk> 
 * story * he had moved in with me since he was/is essentially a <unk> 
 no credit cards no steady employment no permanent address except those people he <unk> off of obscenely heavy in debt because he never paid off medical bills for his numerous trips to the er to score pain meds ... he always had weird <unk> '' i guess you could call them that to get money but they rarely paid off like he thought they would 
 he had nice clothes that showed off his seriously ridiculously nice body and expensive electronics like his laptop and ipad and iphone but other than that he was a <unk> 
 he 'd go out of town on business trips '' -- and <unk> i know how incredibly cliche that is -- where of course he was partying sleeping with women and doing <unk> to earn cash under the table 
 to this day i have no idea what his regular source of income was but i do n't think he was a drug dealer just from what i 've learned about him over time 
 * revenge * i 'm a girl but i 'm a bit of a <unk> 
 or at least i know how to use computers better than he ever did 
 i eventually found all his hidden laptop pictures and his cloud photo storage 
 i once sat there and watched his iphone upload live <unk> to his <unk> i was an emotional wreck but i kept it together 
 eventually i had kicked enough of the drug habit to operate <unk> of him long-term and i started collecting evidence '' though i did n't know for what 
 i think i just needed something <unk> to hold on to to tell myself what i was going through was real 
 so i copied all his text conversations on his phone when he was asleep i copied all his hard drive pictures and then i finally contacted the woman who seemed to be his main girl when he was away from me and <unk> everything i had discovered 
 turns out he was essentially doing the same thing to her 
 you could tell he had a type '' because she was almost a mirror of me : <unk> short skinny but with ample ... <unk> <unk> of land ... and totally clueless about the whole thing 
 but unlike me she had a furious temper 
 she destroyed his phone and ipad while he was seeing her up in new york and she had me erase all his pictures off his cloud and then shatter his laptop with my car several states to their south 
 he called me the next day with what was another iphone that he must have bought out of pocket 
 he did n't know about my part of his recent turn of events but i told him i knew what he had been up to and that i set all of his personal effects outside in <unk> boxes and told him he 'd better collect them before the bad weather we were <unk> to have over the next several days 
 he was pissed and did n't believe me and never came home that week 
 meanwhile all his stuff sat outside and got rained on all week 
 oh and my cat may have used the bathroom on his nicest clothes before i boxed them up too 
 he eventually showed up that next weekend with the other girl by his side 
 i do n't know what was going on that she was still around but i suspect he was owing her a lot of money and that she intended to collect it by keeping him on a short leash 
 either way that was the last i ever saw of him : collecting all his ruined personal effects and driving away in a rental car 
 i learned later that when she was done with him the other woman turned him over to the police because he had warrants in four states 
 * epilogue * he berated me on almost a daily basis for several months afterward <unk> between trying to make me feel worse about myself than i already did and then trying to get me to forgive him and take him back 
 he threatened to kill himself and i suggested that he might want to seriously consider it considering i had just given his parent 's phone number and home <unk> address to all the debt <unk> that were harassing me at the time 
 he could n't <unk> that i had grown a <unk> much less gotten one over on someone as brilliant as <unk> he finally resorted to vulgar name calling and trying to use my <unk> sexual past with him to bring me back down but it did n't work 
 i never blocked him because i wanted him to keep sending me sob stories of how i ruined his life and what <unk> he was having now because of me 
 it was all very <unk> 
 he almost caused me to fail and drop out of my senior year of college but i somehow managed to get through by the skin of my teeth and after getting myself clean and doing a little counseling i 'm doing quite well for myself 
 edit : formatting and general clean-up 
 i 'm a <unk> writing so i have to edit myself down to not sound like i 'm rambling 
 edit 2 : i have been informed by several of you that my ex probably had antisocial personality disorder 
 he and i did see a <unk> at one point where she threw out numerous terms that might be applicable to his situation <unk> and <unk> included 
 narcissistic personality disorder was on the list too and <unk> are he has several things going on at once not one simple thing to blame 
 and speaking of blaming i do want to apologize to those of you with borderline personality disorder who felt that i was attacking him due to his mental issues alone 
 i assure you that my totally awesome revenge was purely due to the actions he took against me like the lying the cheating the stealing the physical and sexual abuse the <unk> and the ruining of relationships of both family and friends 
 i thought the story made it clear why revenge was warranted but if you somehow thought it was an attack on you personally because you share a similar diagnosis with my own personal demons then i apologize 
 thank you for informing me that i 'm just as bad as he <unk> on mobile so sorry for formatting 
 quick backstory i ride my bike to the gym with my friend <unk> everyday and lock it on the bike rack 
 i get out of the gym look at the bike rack and only see one bike 
 i look to my friend <unk> and say where 's your bike '' 
 he turns and says where 's your bike .. 
 i soon realize the bike missing is mine 
 my bike cost me $ 250 
 for a 17 year old highschool kid without a job thats a fortune 
 i call the police 
 they ca n't do much because my local <unk> <unk> does n't have cameras 
 i filed a stolen item report 
 a few days later at <unk> my sister calls me 
 she sees my bike at <unk> i throw on clothes and start sprinting 
 it 's about a 5 minute drive with traffic 
 my adrenaline keeps me running 
 when i arrive i find out that my sister confronted him and he rode off 
 my sister told me it was a homeless man with a ponytail and a tattoo on his neck 
 the <unk> owner said he 's local comes everyday 
 i was hopeless after a month goes by 
 i looked at every bike i <unk> today my mom was driving me to the gym and i see 2 homeless men riding bikes in the middle of the road 
 when we pass them my vision was in slow motion 
 it was my bike 
 the guy with the pony tail and tattoo was on a white bike 
 i tell my mom to pull up down the road 
 i get out of the car and slowly walk towards them 
 i scream in my <unk> voice excuse me that 's my bike '' i said it in a stern voice im 6 '' 4 <unk> 
 they acted like they did n't hear me and tried nonchalantly riding passed me 
 they did n't speed up 
 i <unk> the man off my bike 
 adrenaline <unk> i said i said that 's my fucking bike '' the man with the tattoo looked shocked was n't expecting this to happen 
 we get in a heated argument i hop on my bike and ride home 
 if they ever try to find me for revenge i 'll kill both of them 
 edit : the reason i <unk> him off my bike is because he was with the homeless man with tattoo on his neck and a pony tail 
 i would n't have done it if i was n't certain 
 edit # 2 : im done arguing with people who disagree what i did 
 you will be ignored 
 and i would n't fucking kill them for no reason i said if they try and get revenge 
 fyi places and names have been changed 
 i was desperate for work and i happen to walk into a store i shop at regularly and was okay acquaintances with the boss 
 he offered me a job and offered to train me up since he needed <unk> people 
 in a month i was his star employee filling in for the ones who call in sick fixing problems working my ass off and also smashing sale targets with him saying ill train you since at that point he had n't <unk> how to put through a sale 
 then one day he came up to me and mentioned id been making mistakes and all the little ones were adding up 
 i said but you only gave me basic till training and his response you should know by now '' 
 then the shift cutting happened and then i found out he started talking real horrible stuff to other employees behind my back 
 the assistant manager actually felt sorry for me but i was constantly <unk> 
 like if i even looked away for a second id have my assistant manager going dont ignore that <unk> two seconds prior they were not even there they literally just lined up or as i said hey im doing this first they would ignore what i said and say yes you need to do that first not <unk> treated like dirt no other employees even wanted to talk to me 
 the plotting 
 so at first i stopped doing things that <unk> me in wrong doing as i suspected i was being blamed for stuff i never did i documented it <unk> pictures a <unk> you name it 
 when my manager went on longer than normal breaks i time <unk> it on my phone and wrote it down 
 then he fucked up and wrote a mass text to everyone calling us names for fucking up 
 i screen <unk> that immediately as the next day he asked to delete that message as it was a prank 
 bullshit he stood over me and watched me delete it 
 i also wrote this down 
 i tried to be friendly with my co-workers but they barely said a word to me but to shut up and keep working 
 my last shift there i didnt know it was at the time i was so over it i was being super nice to people and gave them deals that i knew i could do just to at least feel like a human and get some sort of enjoyment in work 
 this didnt go down well as i got a talking out to with me ending the conversation with i dont really care anymore 
 in the process i was looking for a new job and a day before my performance review by my manager i was offered a new job starting immediately as of tomorrow 
 this was a <unk> and i sent a message to my manager that i wont be coming in as i quit he never responded but my asm did and said okay you dont get store discount anymore 
 not even a sorry to see you go 
 but <unk> the revenge 
 oh it came i waited 4 months after i left 
 i let the dust settle and then i got everything into order and sent a lovely huge email to my regional manager 
 the thing is they all forgot i was on very good terms with him to the point he was sad that i left 
 i wrote down a few things saying i felt after all this time this needed to be aired out and that i was told i have a legitimate claim for workplace harassment but i wanted to deal with you first 
 i had a huge response saying they would look into this right away an apology that this happened all i asked was to stay anonymous 
 i got a response 3 weeks later saying he was no longer representing the company as a way for me not to pursue legal action 
 after that response i decided to buy something from that store 
 apparently my ex manager did not see it coming they dumped a head office employee in his store to watch him for week and <unk> everything he did even if he <unk> wrong it was noted they then asked him to explain the mass text message of abuse and they used all i sent him plus the head office report to fire him 
 in my country you need a <unk> of evidence to fire fulltime contracts the <unk> are now being split up into other stores as well to kill the group 
 they still have no idea i did it 
 the asm was shocked as he thinks someone in the store did it for personal gain or a promotion 
 i know it seems perfect but with the regional ive known him when he used to be a <unk> in that very store and we got along great and kept in contact for years after he got promoted 
 i was lucky in that respect as many people dont have higher connections like that 
 how do i end this ... well im now in fulltime employment his facebook feed is filled with complaints about no money 
 karma bitch 
 not sure how pro this was but here it is anyway 
 a friend of mine put an ad in the local paper looking for a <unk> and had to go through the <unk> task of meeting and <unk> one 
 this guy called her up and was sounding a little weird 
 he started asking her if there was enough room for his suits in the wardrobe and she said that she thought so but he was n't convinced and kept going on about it 
 she quickly put him in the no category and when he asked for the address she balked and made an excuse about not knowing when she could show him 
 she got his number and told him that she 'd call him when she had time 
 he called back a couple of days later after not hearing from her and she told him that the room was taken 
 he got abusive and called her a number of names so she hung up 
 this guy called a couple more times over the next few days to tell her what a bitch she was 
 this guy was a total asshole and my friend felt unsafe but luckily he only called a couple of times 
 we waited a couple of weeks and i placed an ad in the free section of the local paper 
 because it was free there was no payment for the ad and no way to trace it apart from the throwaway email address that i made 
 the ad read something like 
 free armani suits 
 i 'm going overseas and am giving away my entire collection of immaculate armani suits 
 first in takes the lot 
 this guy started getting calls at <unk> in the morning from every secondhand dealer bargain hunter and who knows who <unk> know because i called him at about <unk> and he was going nuts 
 it was hilarious and i wish that i 'd recorded it 
 he figured that someone had placed the ad and gotten the number wrong 
 i ran the ad again the following week with the same results : this is my story of malicious compliance 
 i used to work for a large heavy equipment rental company 
 we had a large fleet of equipment plus pickup trucks for <unk> that included fuel pumps for the equipment when on a job site for extended periods of time 
 in the beginning i was a parts runner with the shop manager nosferatu because that is how he looked as my direct supervisor 
 then there was the branch manager dong because that is what he is who <unk> everything 
 dong lived up to his namesake 
 had a military style flat top even though he never served and yelled constantly 
 my sister also worked for this company and he constantly berated her for get this : doing her job properly 
 she got her own malicious compliance in but was eventually laid off '' when the company hit a rough patch turned out to be the best thing ever because she now has a far better job 
 dong continued to talk crap about everybody and any time i would approach him regarding things i heard he told other on my work ethic he claimed he never said it 
 if i am doing my job wrong i want to improve but he claimed i was doing everything right 
 yet when my reviews came around his comments were always negative and i would not get a raise 
 nosferatu and the assistant service manager were fired because they brought guns to work and were firing them into boxes in the office after hours 
 i was offered the role of assistant service manager for that branch and our neighboring branch which also meant the service manager of the neighbor branch was to oversee both we 'll call him gonzo because and became my direct supervisor 
 also i was now considered a corporate employee so dong had no control over my position 
 he tried his best to fuck with me trying to change my schedule make me spend more time in his branch etc and while i <unk> to comply it was n't with much effort 
 my boss spent more time in dong 's branch and i spent more time in the other because we lived closer <unk> and we could divide and <unk> 
 the system was working well and we were bringing the maintenance department into the current age <unk> 
 during this time the company installed gps units on every piece of equipment that was rented and pickup truck 
 we could track running times for billing purposes and <unk> were sending alerts if someone drove over <unk> really fucking annoying 
 the amount of data i could pull was amazing and we only opted for about 1/4 of the options 
 one morning a tractor we used at dong 's yard was missing 
 it did n't have gps but there was a truck with a trailer capable of towing the tractor hooked up next to the shop 
 on a <unk> i checked the gps for the truck and the night before it went directly to dong 's house and came back early that morning 
 i downloaded a few reports created a new gmail account and sent everything to our corporate office anonymously 
 2 days later the tractor was back and i never heard anything 
 some time later dong demands that we wire a specific truck 's gps unit to send a signal when the <unk> fuel pump gets turned on 
 simple work and something the company should have opted for to begin with one extra wire but he wanted to set up a certain operator who was believed to be stealing fuel 
 i tried to explain that this is unethical and potentially illegal had no idea if it was actually illegal and dong just screamed at me that he would have his buddies in corporate fire me 
 when he left my office i called gonzo and the head of maintenance to cover my ass 
 gonzo thinking ahead requested if we could start doing this on all of the trucks which the head of maintenance said yes 
 he asked me not to tell anybody but the mechanics about it 
 sure enough the night the operator took the truck home the fuel pump was turned on in 3 locations on his property 
 he was promptly <unk> and dong was stiff with satisfaction see what i did there 
 months later we have all of the trucks in our branches wired to the fuel pumps and i have long forgotten about it 
 i 'm at work in the neighbor branch while gonzo is at dong 's and he calls me from his cell phone : & gt gonzo : hey dude 
 can you pull up the gps on truck xyz 
 & gt & gt me : are you fucking blind 
 it is right outside your office window 
 & gt & gt gonzo : no shit 
 where did it go last night 
 & gt & gt me now understanding and a couple clicks later : dude ... it went to dong 's and the fuel pump was on for 15 minutes ... & gt & gt gonzo : we filled that tank up last night for a job today 100 gallons and it is bone dry now 
 print the reports and send them to me 
 now i knew my boss was going to report this 
 he had friends in corporate too 
 but i also knew how things get swept under the rug in the company which our parent company must have known when they implemented a third party ethics hotline '' where we could report anything 
 and dong was adamant about us using it 
 so i did 
 i took the gps reports the video from our cameras showing the yard guy filling the <unk> tank and dong later leaving with the vehicle and a <unk> of what i believe happened all from the anon gmail account 
 the ethics hotline was required to report everything to the company and follow up to get a resolution 
 i knew at the bare minimum i would receive a response 
 my prayers were answered a week later when the head of safety r. <unk> <unk> was in our area for his routine visits '' 
 r like his name sake was a retired marine drill instructor 
 kind as can be in general but takes no shit and is n't afraid to tell you 
 his first stop when he visited was my office 
 as i knew when sending everything to the ethics hotline it would easily be traceable to me i just did n't want it in writing 
 r knew what was up and we went through everything together 
 without saying as much i knew he agreed with my findings 
 he was disappointed i did not come to him first but he also understood my mistrust in the system for previous issues before he was with the company 
 r made the rounds talking to others and got the same general story from everybody that dong was <unk> of tube steak 
 by then end of the week it was announced that dong was leaving the company and the two branches would now entirely act as one while remaining physically separate 
 all of our jobs were made significantly easier because nothing was separated anymore and we did n't have a walking <unk> spewing off constantly i did it again 
 i never spoke to dong again however he does show up on my linkedin recommendations often 
 every time i see his name i view his profile 
 years later he has no new employer he was close to retirement and he says he is a construction consultant '' 
 i take constant joy in knowing he gets to see my face for <unk> his profile and he can see me moving up at my new company 
 edit : added link to why i felt it was unethical per <unk> 's question <unk> story happened in about 12 years ago 
 i was working for a company that owned intellectual property rights to some <unk> <unk> tech headquartered in phoenix arizona 
 in 2002 the owner of the company suggested to his employees the possibility of relocating the whole business to san diego 
 the company was very small only about 5 people in the whole <unk> and all of the co-workers knew each other and were more or less friends either with each other or with the ceo 
 the boss insisted that we all had a vote and if anyone voted against the move the company would stay 
 we all voted unanimously to move to san diego and our first couple years we ended up all living in the same apartment complex in mission <unk> 
 the new office location was intentionally headquartered across the street from the apartment community which as you might imagine was very convenient 
 in those days i drove a new pickup truck and since my office was across the street i did n't drive my vehicle much except on weekends or special trips 
 as a result the vehicle remained parked for long periods of time in the covered parking area of the garage 
 one day i went out to my vehicle to find a hefty trash bag dumped in the back of my truck 
 naturally i found it a bit creepy and <unk> 
 when i hopped onto the bed of the truck to haul it out i found to my utter disgust that it was dripping wet with <unk> from rancid meat of some kind -- i think probably chicken 
 at this point i angrily decided that i was going to figure out who did this even if i have to manually sort through every item of trash in this stinking kitchen bag 
 i donned some <unk> gloves and went to work fishing <unk> <unk> from the rotting trash bag 
 <unk> i struck <unk> : i found a utility bill envelope that had been crumpled up 
 i opened it up and discovered that the culprit was one of my co-workers who <unk> himself a bit of a prankster 
 said offender i 'll call him cam lived in the same apartment phase as i did just a few doors down 
 first a little context : back in those days i was fascinated with <unk> 
 i owned among other things a <unk> gun which admittedly requires very little skill to operate aside from that it is convenient because they are quicker than using a rake or individual picks 
 i also owned some basic phone testing equipment including a <unk> <unk> lineman <unk> 
 with some effort i succeeded to locate the <unk> phone utility closet on my floor and was able to let myself in 
 i do n't remember if i had to use an <unk> line to identify cam 's circuit or whether the termination points were labeled but i did manage to locate the ring and tip for his pair 
 then using the lineman set i was able to use <unk> to <unk> the call forwarding feature this was <unk> at & amp t in those days 
 i forwarded all of his calls to the local <unk> restaurant 
 more context : my co-workers all <unk> me <unk> because i refused to eat at jitb <unk> well i simply did n't like the food 
 this would make it <unk> obvious at some point that i was the person responsible since jitb was a running office joke by this time 
 after forwarding his line i <unk> the ring and tip which <unk> the line out status : line was dead and calls were forwarded to jitb 
 i let cam believe that i had hacked his phone service provider 's switch yes he was <unk> and let him beg for two days before <unk> the damage 
 meanwhile everyone in the office thought it was the funniest revenge they had ever heard of and agreed the response was appropriate 
 btw yes this really happened apologies in advance to <unk> - this dates back to <unk> when i lived with my parents in a university town 
 we used to have students live next door and a little downhill from us and they 'd continually park their cars inside our property near a dodgy fence between our properties 
 their place was full of junk and only had one accessible driveway where one of the <unk> students would always park 
 dad was a <unk> man and while he was incredibly patient with these guys and would ask them repeatedly to move their cars he hit breaking point one weekend there was a big race in town 
 half a dozen visiting student guest shitbox cars ended up in our lawn and he went around to protest saying it 'd gone beyond ridiculous especially in wet weather when it 'd be likely to damage his lawn all the more 
 they promised like they always did that they 'd get the cars out and not park there ever again but hey - the race was on they all wanted to watch it and have a decent sunday and they 'd leave them there until the race was over 
 as i mentioned our back yard was <unk> from theirs and part way through the race it really started <unk> down 
 dad did n't show any <unk> anger but he went into town came back with a few bottles of dishwashing liquid and coated the whole lawn in the stuff 
 come evening some of the guys needed to move their cars and when they got to the downhill <unk> to go out our driveway found they could n't steer or brake 
 two made it out without much damage but the third slid sideways got onto the <unk> part of the lawn and went straight through the fence and into one of the other students cars and pushed it sideways into the house 
 total damage 
 four student cars with dents one with busted front suspension one wall of the student rental totalled a bunch of arrogant students kicked out and a few <unk> on dad 's lawn 
 total cost to my dad 
 four bucks in dishwashing liquid a few weeks lawn <unk> and a brand new fence shared with the new neighbours who were pretty decent people 
 dad 's response to the police asking about the <unk> shit on the lawn 
 white oil 
 kills bugs '' **tl dr : arrogant neighbours kept parking on my dad 's lawn so one day when a whole lot of them were parked on the hill he <unk> up the lawn and they went everywhere 
 damage caused neighbours to be kicked out problem solved revenge gained 
 **so full <unk> i was reminded of this incident by this /r/pettyrevenge post which you can find here however as a result of what happened due to the revenge i felt that it was worth posting in /r/prorevenge 
 not trying to <unk> <unk> but <unk> reminded me of this story that i had to share with you guys 
 if you want more i recommend checking out that story as well as it 's definitely a good read 
 <unk> : great wall of text is <unk> anyways this is a story that made it 's way around my graduate school last year i was in a related program but not this specific one 
 masters of public policy mpp students in my school are required to complete what is called a practicum a year long research project where you work with an actual government <unk> <unk> 
 the practicum is supposed to be a project where you demonstrate everything you have learned over the two year program and many students rely on it as an example of the research they are able to produce for job applications once they graduate 
 it 's an important part of the program and if you do n't complete the practicum you do n't graduate ** <unk> ** 
 needless to say it is an extremely stressful project for the mpp 's and most students take it very seriously 
 of course you get lazy assholes even in very high ranking graduate programs to put it in some context this program is one of the top 10 in the entire country and arguably the best of it 's kind on the west coast 
 this is a story of one of those assholes getting the ultimate karmic <unk> 
 there were three members of this infamous group two of which pat and ryan were very well known in the program as being very intelligent and driven students 
 however kiran the third member was the complete opposite 
 he was an indian kid that came from a very rich family possibly book smart but nobody knew for sure because he was incredibly lazy and completed stoned 100 % of the time even in classes 
 now do n't get me wrong i also have a healthy appreciation for weed but smoking right before class in such a competitive graduate program is pretty disrespectful to the professor and your classmates 
 he also got in serious trouble his first year for sexually harassing multiple female international students targeting them specifically to take advantage of their lack of <unk> in english and lack of understanding of how seriously american universities take these types of <unk> 
 luckily these ladies still saw through his creepy bullshit and reported him to the school 's administration 
 since the program is very expensive and only <unk> two years the school let him off with a final warning 
 one more violation of the student conduct code would result in his immediate dismissal from the program 
 needless to say at the start of the 2nd year of the program nobody wanted to be in his practicum group 
 not a single person 
 perhaps in order to give him a fighting chance the professor assigned kiran to pat and ryan 's group because those two were known to be star pupils 
 they were also the only group that was made up of only males so he would n't have the desire to sexually harass them in the intimate research setting that they would be working in for the year 
 naturally kiran did none of work on the practicum barely attending any of the group research sessions and was completely high whenever he decided to give pat and ryan the pleasure of his company 
 this went on for the remainder of the academic year 
 now pat and ryan were known to be pretty friendly guys but they did not take any bullshit from anyone 
 they confronted him multiple times about his lack of contribution to the practicum but nothing ever changed 
 at this point they could have just reported him to the professor who would have removed him from the group and given him the chance to complete the practicum on his own 
 but pat and ryan had a much more devious plan in mind 
 after the 5th or 6th argument with him they just gave up on trying to get him to work on the project 
 however they kept him informed about the project 's progress emailing him about when they were meeting for group research sessions and what his share of the work would be 
 as expected kiran 's behavior did n't change 
 on the last day of class groups were expected to turn in the written practicum report and present their findings to the entire class 
 pat and ryan submitted their report without kiran 's name attached to the report and started their presentation with an announcement that since he had n't contributed anything to the research kiran did not deserve to receive any credit for the work 
 apparently kiran was in the middle of walking to the front of the class to try and fake his way through the presentation when this announcement was made 
 he stopped <unk> his jaw dropped and then silently returned to his seat once the professor gave pat and ryan permission to continue the presentation without him 
 **the aftermath** kiran pat and ryan were summoned to the dean 's office so he could hear both sides of the story 
 in an act of desperation kiran tried to place the blame on pat and ryan 
 he accused them of lying claiming they never told him when the group work was taking place they excluded him from <unk> in the research they were <unk> against him because he was indian etc 
 etc 
 he tried every slimy excuse he could come up with in a sad attempt to save his academic career 
 now remember pat and ryan had documented their attempts to get kiran to do his fair share of the work on the project and were able to produce digital and print copies of the emails as evidence 
 one look at the emails and the dean immediately took pat and ryan 's side 
 kiran would not receive any credit for the practicum project and since he did n't even bother showing up to class half the time he did n't even have class <unk> points to bump his f up to a d which may or may not have earned him a passing grade 
 but that 's not even the best part : the dean in his infinite wisdom and <unk> decided to give kiran the opportunity to come back the following year 
 he would be allowed to <unk> the practicum class again and if he completed his project he would be allowed to graduate with his degree 
 now i do n't know exactly how rich kiran 's family was but after paying over $ 100,000 in tuition over two years his family was not going to shell out another $ <unk> dollars for him to come back for a completely unnecessary third year in the program 
 he wasted 2 years of his life $ 100,000 of his family 's money and had nothing to show for it no degree no professors that would be willing to write him any sort of professional reference no network of classmates that would be willing to help him out in any way at all all because he was n't willing to put in the work to pass one final course 
 i 've gone to a number of <unk> <unk> since graduation and i can confirm kiran was never seen or heard from again 
 tl dr : do your fucking part in group work especially in graduate <unk> i used to work as a delivery driver for a furniture retailer and it was actually a pretty okay job if you like heavy lifting of course 
 except for my manager <unk> 
 now <unk> bn for short was about 19 not all that bright and got to his position as warehouse manager by kissing massive amounts of ass 
 i was a few months older than him and had been there for a year or so 
 maybe a bit less 
 but point is i was one of the more senior guys on the delivery staff 
 so one fine day my truck went out did it 's deliveries and was back by about 1pm we started at 8 and usually went to 4-5 for reference 
 i was looking forward to going home a bit early but bn had different plans for me 
 what 's important to remember in what follows is that bn was a salaried worker and i had an hourly wage 
 i finish loading up my truck for the next day and am just walking to the punch clock to punch out for the day when i hear his <unk> voice 
 bn : hey <unk> hold on a <unk> 
 me : what is it bn 
 bn : i need you to go out and wash your truck 
 it 's dirty and that does n't reflect well on the company 
 me : <unk> bn : come on chop chop 
 i 'm not paying you to stand around 
 me : you do n't pay me shit 
 i had no respect for this guy and he and i both knew it 
 but i got shit done so the higher-ups were n't about to get rid of me 
 bn : yeah well that can change if you do n't do what i say 
 here 's what you 'll need to wash it 
 the pressure washer is outside 
 <unk> hands me things like <unk> bottles of glass cleaner leather polish for the dashboard industrial soap you know basic truck cleaning stuff * me : whoah whoah hey now 
 i 've never used this stuff before and i 've seen these <unk> <unk> before 
 i 'm going to need to have a look at the msds sheets for all of these supplies 
 bn : dude no 
 it 's glass cleaner and soap 
 it 's in literally every household 
 just go do what i tell you 
 me : no 
 i have the right to refuse unsafe work and until i fully understand the hazards that these materials present and have all the necessary ppe personal protective equipment i do n't feel safe using these products 
 bn : stop being dumb 
 just go do it 
 me : this is in direct violation of <unk> health & amp safety guidelines and if forced to proceed i will be <unk> a formal complaint both with oh & amp s as well as <unk> 
 at this point bn knows he is defeated 
 but i 'm still just warming up 
 bn : fine 
 the sheets are this way 
 he takes me to the room with the msds sheets where i spend the next 15 minutes <unk> the sheets asking <unk> questions just to make sure he does n't leave 
 remember i 'm getting paid by the hour 
 he is n't 
 me : well these supplies have the potential to cause skin and eye <unk> and this other cleaner needs to be used in a <unk> area 
 i 'm going to require ppe to protect against these hazards 
 cue half an hour of bn and i <unk> around the warehouse looking for rubber gloves that came past my <unk> a thick rubber apron rubber boots a plastic face shield safety <unk> and a <unk> 
 pretty much this stuff but it was n't all in one convenient location like this 
 i <unk> all the safety gear 
 bn is visibly agitated 
 bn : you look like an idiot 
 i hope you know that 
 me : i look like a <unk> idiot 
 i 'm alright with that 
 bn : alright now will you go wash the truck 
 me : i 've never used the pressure washer before 
 i 'm going to need to be fully trained on that before i operate it 
 bn : there 's an on button three power settings and a trigger 
 a 4 year old could work it 
 me : i do n't feel safe using it until i 've been properly trained in it 's operation 
 i could hurt myself 
 if looks could kill i would be dead 
 but luckily i am protected from his acid gaze by my ppe 
 seriously i 'm fucking <unk> under all this shit 
 we head out to the pressure washer and i make him go over everything in <unk> detail 
 again i question everything 
 if there 's a <unk> in the hose could the machine <unk> 
 what if it <unk> 
 this is a <unk> washer 
 what if gas <unk> 
 i 'll need a fire extinguisher ... '' this takes almost 20 minutes 
 we also have to go find the aforementioned fire extinguisher 
 at this point we 're about an hour and fifteen minutes into this and i have n't even started washing the truck 
 me : oh hey bn 
 before you go you 'll need to show me how ot use all these chemical <unk> 
 i read the msds sheets but i still do n't know how to properly use them 
 bn pretty much washes half the interior of the truck no ppe of course with me asking ever more questions 
 me : alright 
 i think i feel ready to do this now 
 bn : finally 
 asshole 
 me : i take my safety seriously and you should too 
 bn storms off muttering under his breath 
 i proceed to take 10 minutes wiping down the truck and another 5 <unk> it clean 
 i go into bn 's office 
 me : alright i 'm done 
 bn : that was fast 
 me : it was a pretty easy job 
 here 's all the ppe back 
 thanks for being understanding concerning my safety 
 i drop the ppe in a pile on his carpeted floor 
 it was covered in the mud from the exterior of the truck 
 me : i think i 'm going to take off now 
 have a good night bn 
 he did n't reply 
 he just looked like he wanted to cry 
 i left a little after 3pm that day having wasted almost 2 hours of bn 's time 
 i found out the next day that he did n't leave til 7 that night 
 i was never asked to wash the trucks again 
 tl dr : i take my safety seriously 
 even more so when i 'm getting paid by the hour and my cunt hair of a boss is salaried 
 previous post link thank you guys for all your support 
 just wanted to tell you how everything went over 
 about <unk> days later i can tell you that <unk> has come to my classroom 
 i took a few of your suggestions <unk> the anon emails and the <unk> box and i got a confession 
 maybe that 's because i offered to cut the test in half for the innocent give 75 questions to the <unk> and 150 to those who were found out but did n't confess 
 i could n't match the anon <unk> 's handwriting to anything but then they mentioned 4 more that joined in 
 the math teacher around the corner had more <unk> than little young fizzfox 
 the moment she caught <unk> of my issue she came into my classes and gave them militant <unk> <unk> 
 she came back and told me that one burst out into tears and ratted on the other four 
 three of them were in my lunch class and one of them was in her lunch class 
 according to one of my students hers had the idea to wreck the place when he heard that my sub handed a student the key to lock the door for lunch 
 apparently he wanted revenge on me since i 'm usually put on detention duty on wednesdays and he 's always <unk> to his classes on wednesdays <unk> the <unk> 
 no phones in detention which is school policy 
 i really do n't care about that silly rule but i want to keep my job 
 he had the nerve to make a phone call in my face without even asking my permission 
 as soon as he finished the call i politely asked him to put it away 
 he did n't and went to playing fruit ninja kids still play that game 
 hmm ... 
 so i told him to wipe down my board and straighten a few books while i <unk> a score for a coming concert 
 enough about him my blood 's boiling a little 
 his mom <unk> me 
 turns out this kid put tape over the security camera and went to work with the others 
 no audio but they ran out of the room grinning 
 to sum up i 'm almost a happy musician again 
 that kid has a 200 question exam in math 
 i was offered to pick the questions but i declined 
 his mother offered to pay for the piano though 
 i do n't believe in denying a kid that wants to learn music but if he ever wants to be my student & lt insert <unk> here & gt 
 my room 's back in order class is great once more and we 're having an end of the year concert to top it all off 
 to <unk> those <unk> -- i mean students agreed to pass out <unk> the week before get t-shirts and hand out tickets at the door 
 and clean up duty 
 thanks kids 
 do n't shoot yourselves in your feet again 
 : - edit : before you call my <unk> mood rash i did tell my other students that i was sorry 
 and they apologized as well since they were marked guilty when that kid told him he did it 
 he threatened to do something to mr. fizzfox if they snitched 
 expulsion was at the top of the list but his mother argued it down to a <unk> suspension 
 damn that woman 
 i see a <unk> vest in my future ... and the sub 
 i still did n't get any luck contacting them whoever they were 
 kids told me their name and the principal told me that the sub was n't allowed back 
 i 'm <unk> or so years ago i was involved in a <unk> internet community forum pre <unk> days that was centered around my local area 
 here i met up with this gal i 'll call psycho mary sue pms who started taking an interest in me and in replying to a lot of my posts 
 we hit it off online and soon my online friends in the community began notifying me that she was asking questions and inquiring more about who i was and what i did 
 this was all during a time when <unk> stalkers and internet related crimes to persons were all in the news 
 it did n't bother me that she was checking up to see if i was legit it just told me she was interested and wanted to know more 
 we started dating but found out she really was n't the <unk> type material and overall we did n't have much in common 
 pms was rather crude with language smoked the nastiest cigarettes i 've ever smelt and had questionable illegal drug habit s i was n't into 
 the kicker to this winner was that one of the words on her arm tattoo was misspelled important later 
 she was really into me but from the start and wanted a friends w benefits relationship when i said i was n't interested any further 
 hold the phone 
 just sex only 
 sounds too good to be true right 
 my hormone 's were in full gear but i was in my right mind to have pms get checked 
 <unk> 's gave her the clean bill of health free of std 's and the like so everything seemed to be good to go 
 our first few weeks were hot and heavy 
 i started to sense that things were amiss when she became more and more <unk> 
 checking my phone and email accounts calling at odd hours and while i was at work 
 back then my ego was about as large as my bank accounts so rather than ending it like i should have i continued thinking i could control her 
 what i did next was a dick move i know but i asked her for a private xxx picture session in <unk> for gifts 
 she did n't even bat an eye and made it clear it would cost me in material goods for the favor 
 i got my explicit photo session with pms and our normal hot and kinky <unk> continued for a few more months 
 around this time i noticed funny things were happening around my place like my desk drawers appeared <unk> through my financial <unk> just disappeared before i got it 
 the sex was still fun but a nagging feeling kept <unk> at the back of my mind to end it 
 i got the first real redflag when i got a <unk> at work from my bank that someone tried to use my <unk> at a local department store 
 the female culprit with tattoos fled the scene but that 's all the proof i had that it was her 
 i confronted her with no position to judge but she denied everything 
 suspicious of her actions i started seeing her less and less of her over the few weeks and through disinterest and mistrust i then called it off 
 the shit hit the fan once i did and i quickly found out that back at the start of the relationship she was n't just checking up on me she was gathering a portfolio on me 
 she was a golddigger <unk> researching her latest claim 
 i made good money had a great job and she felt that it was hers now 
 even though i had bought her things during our relationship other small items in my place of minimal value started disappearing 
 not only that she had no shame in attempting to blackmail me by calling my <unk> and even my job 
 pms made it clear that she would pretty much continue this until i gave her $ 2000 from what i owed '' her in taking and keeping the pictures 
 i had destroyed her name '' hah 
 by doing so 
 she <unk> me and my influence with <unk> and friends 
 i was able to <unk> them all to ignore her and i filed a restraining order within a few days 
 pms made several attempted to make good on threats 
 after she got the <unk> pms all but dropped <unk> after a week or so 
 several months later my place was broken into and my computer tv personal records and some sentimental items of little value were stolen 
 the police could n't find any prints but clearly knew that the thief must 've been familiar with me 
 they grabbed everything of value while disturbing next to nothing that normal burglars go for 
 aka drawers filing cabinets certain desk drawers etc 
 that same day pms attempted to <unk> money from another department store using a spare atm i kept hidden that she obviously found while <unk> my place 
 my pin was easy to figure out and i found out via a fraud alert phone call that this card was being used for the first time 
 <unk> on her and lucky me 
 she had stolen my computer so she thought all the photos of her were in her possession 
 she forgot to take the backups i had in cd 's right next to it 
 i gave the police all the sexually explicit digital photos in hopes that the department store surveillance would identify her 
 the female was wearing a hat and glasses and no other positive means of <unk> except for an exposed <unk> 
 the cops found the misspelled tattoo via her arm the video and were able to positively identify her in the act of fraud 
 i do n't remember how long it took felt like months but pms was eventually arrested and convicted because of the photos i gave to the cops 
 i was told by the arresting officer who also handled my <unk> that the <unk> used post-it notes to cover up her naughty bits in full poster sized versions of the photos i took that identified her 
 lol 
 i never got back my computer officer says she probably trashed it as it was n't worth much and some of my personal sentimental items she wanted to use for blackmail but the revenge was mine 
 <unk> some <unk> i got a call from a guy with a heavy african accent 
 he was <unk> my immediate attention to this matter 
 he said if he did n't hear back from my lawyer or me within a certain <unk> that he wished me luck 
 i did a little bit of internet <unk> and realized this was a <unk> 
 i called back several times just harassing and he was getting very fed up with dealing with me 
 he hung up on me several times and kept telling me to call him at 9am when the office opened back up 
 i placed a nice craigslist ad up and his phone was probably ringing off the hook all night 
 car siting on 20 's 
 <unk> leather seats 
 <unk> grain steering wheels 
 <unk> blues motor knocking and transmission starting slipping 
 350 big blocks what you see is what you get 
 i sleep during the days but worked at night so calling after 10pm is best 
 <unk> calls only please no texts 
 ask for kevin $ 750 cash firm nothing less no room for <unk> 
 got more in the <unk> hope he enjoys his phone ringing nonstop 
 update : i called today and inquired about the chevy <unk> for sale 
 the guy initially answered the phone black & amp associates <unk> '' 
 i said something along the lines of i 'm sorry ... i must have the wrong number 
 i was calling about the car for sale ... '' 
 he pauses momentarily and says yes it is still for sale 
 you should make out a check for $ 500 and mail it to ... some address in miami ... after that we will contact you back and drop off the car '' 
 my friend and i just looked at each other ... these guys are hardcore about scamming some people 
 i kept him on the phone as long as i could asking questions about the car 
 how long have you owned the car ... it 's blue right 
 what kind of leather does it have ... etc 
 etc '' 
 i probably wasted 10 minutes of his life before he hung up on me 
 i felt bad after posting that ad so i took it down 
 the last thing i wanted to do was help them 
 i moved the ad over the the casual encounters 
 i 'm going to do some more digging tomorrow and actually write down the address 
 then i 'm going to call the miami police department and speak to someone in the fraud department 
 here is what the add originally looked like 
 p.s 
 i know you 're not supposed to give out personal information on reddit ... if i broke the rules i 'll remove the screen shot 
 in this instance though ... i think it is probably best if people have that information since it is n't just one person ... it is many 
 i 've heard that # being answered as a collections agency lawyers office and now some sort of car auction house ... it all <unk> on who you get when you call in 
 update 2 : called miami pd they do n't give two flying fucks about it ... i keep getting placed in the call queue and eventually end up at a voicemail box 
 i can not speak with someone live 
 i 'm calling from a throwaway phone number so i 'd rather not give them my real information 
 last & amp final edit : called the <unk> fraud division or some shit ... <unk> filed a complaint 
 not much more than i can do 
 the address where they 're telling me to send money is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 miami <unk> 
 the phone number is <unk> if you did n't notice it in the ad 
 have fun with it 
 if we 're wasting their time they have less time to prey on the vulnerable 
 **tl dr someone tried to scam me 
 i played along and started to call them back just making up bullshit 
 no matter what they played along with it 
 found out this was a serious crime ring and reported it to <unk> 
 hope there is a way to eventually shut it down so vulnerable people do n't get <unk> by them 
 <unk> this is n't the right sub for this please let me know and i 'll remove it or ya know a mod will remove it but in that case i 'd like to be notified as to what i did wrong & lt 3 
 with that out of the way ... let me get on to the revenge 
 a bit of back story is in order here 
 the guy that this story is about will be called sd short for stupid douche and is just as his <unk> <unk> 
 he 's stupid and a douche 
 he was in my physics class which is how i knew him and he was constantly pestering the professor with <unk> <unk> plain incorrect information and was generally an annoyance to the whole class 
 sometimes when he spoke i thought of jamming my pens in my ears 
 a story to highlight his idiocy : one time about two months ago he <unk> up to the <unk> to correct some of our professor 's math which did n't need <unk> because apparently one part of an equation has to be on the left side of the equals sign because otherwise it 's wrong 
 if you 've passed the first grade you understand his error and would likely have <unk> a <unk> groan with the rest of the class 
 mind you we were working with <unk> 's law so it 's not like it was particularly difficult math either 
 basic algebra at most complex 
 now fast forward to today 
 sd comes into the classroom for the first time in a month or so visibly agitated and begins being his loud and obnoxious self 
 later someone notices that he 's working with a screwdriver because he 'd been particularly quiet and sees that he 's working with a <unk> <unk> 
 on the lab bench 
 in the middle of class 
 a friend of mine f1 confronts him about it 
 they get into a <unk> and f1 leaves with a fuck it i 'm tired of your shit '' 
 later he 's getting more <unk> 
 the professor has told him to be quiet no <unk> than fifteen times in the last five minutes 
 eventually he gets so loud and obnoxious that the professor kicks him out 
 to quote my professor to the best of my ability : get out 
 get out 
 yes i 'm kicking you out 
 i have n't done that in <unk> years but i 'm kicking you out 
 get out of my classroom 
 you 're worse than the sunday school that i teach 
 just get out 
 this is way <unk> and you 're lucky i have n't called the dean '' 
 all the while sd is talking back to the professor and as the professor gets sd halfway through the door and turns back to go back to the board sd takes the paintball gun and <unk> <unk> everyone in the classroom as if he were spraying an assault <unk> from the hip 
 i was livid and about a half a <unk> of self control away from <unk> herr professor professor is german but i 'm gon na kick this clown 's ass '' 
 fortunately i had the <unk> to realize that i 'd get in trouble too 
 after class i headed straight to the vice <unk> 's office a group of four people from the class in tow 
 <unk> five minutes later i see sd dragged away in handcuffs 
 i 'm looking forward to a quiet class next week 
 tl dr : ho <unk> wan scrap when i was in my early 20 's i was a single mom and i lived with my mom 
 i was no mooch 
 i split the rent and bills with her etc 
 it was the best financial situation for both of us 
 we lived in a large house that had been <unk> into four apartments and tho many neighbors came and went we stayed 
 one neighbor we had was a girl my age who i had known from school 
 she was also a single mom but her mother had custody of her child and he only visited on weekends 
 i did n't especially like her 
 she was shallow and very sketchy but since i was the only person she knew in the neighborhood she kinda pushed herself on me 
 ok. i knew how to watch my back around that kinda person 
 no biggie 
 one day she calls me to tell me she 's going to move out but not tell the landlord 
 she was gon na leave her stuff mostly rent-a-center stuff she hadnt paid for in months there for a few weeks and asked if i 'd call her cell and let her know if any packages came for her etc 
 she had just broken up with this guy and he had been stalking her so she wanted to move <unk> him knowing where 
 i said ok. that night she comes to my apartment to ask for some cd 's if borrowed and when i went to get them a $ 100 bill of my moms for food shopping the next day went missing from the kitchen table but i did n't notice until she was long gone 
 i knew it was her 
 no one else had been there and my mother and i tore the place apart looking for it 
 what use was calling the cops 
 she 'd probably already spent it on <unk> and weed 
 no point 
 but no one fucks with my mother 
 no one 
 my mom was in years cuz we were a paycheck to paycheck household and our cupboards were pretty thin 
 now this bitch was always locking herself outta her apartment and on numerous occasions i had climbed thru her living room window to open the door for her 
 so i waited till the following day and did just that 
 it was a nice quiet neighborhood and no one batted an eye 
 i 'd lived there longer then anyone and they 'd seen me do this before 
 once i 'm in there i took a box cutter to all her rent-a-center furniture i unlocked the door and called them to come get the stuff that night 
 then i bagged up all the clothes she 'd left behind 
 she liked to <unk> s there were pricy items with the tags still on them all over her room 
 purses and shoes too 
 i made trip after trip bringing this stuff up to my apartment 
 i left her sons room alone no need for him to pay for his mothers <unk> 
 i cleaned all the food she left outta the <unk> and pulled the plug on the fridge and left the door open 
 i took cleaning supplies from under her sink and dumped them all over her expensive <unk> down comforter and mattress 
 she loved buying in bulk so i took all her bulk toiletries soap shampoo <unk> tp paper towels 
 i cleaned this bitch out 
 and what i did n't take i trashed 
 she had also left her cat there to <unk> for himself 
 she ended up not returning for 2 weeks so she fully planned on letting it die a slow and painful death i called the <unk> and had them pick him up as a stray so do n't worry 
 i put the word out i was selling some designer gear and in one day i made $ 400 rock bottom prices 
 i gave my mom $ 300 of it 
 just note : my mom did not approve of how i handled the situation but she also felt the bitch had it coming 
 3 packages turned up for her while she was gone 
 all of them were expensive make-up and <unk> 
 obviously i kept it 
 when she returned 2 weeks later with a u-haul trailer to get her stuff i <unk> hearing her screams to find the furniture gone and a huge bill from rent-a-center on her door 
 there was next to nothing left to take except the items from her sons room and a few this and that 's i had thrown aside 
 she did n't even come up to ask about any deliveries 
 as she brought the last bag of stuff out to the u-haul i opened my window and called out hey 
 <unk> 
 i was wondering if you got a hundred i could borrow 
 she shot me this look i ca n't describe 
 horror rage ... sooooo funny 
 i even went out to wave her off as she drove away : my leadman 's little pickup got filled with packing <unk> as a joke 
 he 's a car <unk> and has a chevy <unk> pickup with enough mods to prove it and the offender was moving away the next day so he thought he 'd get away with the crime 
 as revenge to the offender the leadman <unk> out of steel a 2 foot long penis with balls and made it to attach to the hitch receiver on the offender 's pickup 
 then he put a bolt through the hitch and <unk> the bolt <unk> on 
 the offender drove 1,000 miles like that to his new home and <unk> it comes down to it : if i feel i have been genuinely wronged i want to destroy as much of your life as i can 
 i had a <unk> who once stole from me 
 $ 250 all said and it was to pay my cable bill for a few months which he did n't which ruined mine and my other roommates credit 
 he worked for the same company as me so i put a <unk> <unk> on his computer got to his incoming emails for orders before he did and deleted them 
 he was fired after about 8 months of that 
 the one i 'm reddit famous for though ... i made a girl fat ... and not by marrying her 
 in 2003 my office got a new secretary and a new manager 
 the secretary a thin blonde was a vile <unk> she would n't do anything the staff asked find info set up calls get coffee for anyone who was n't herself and the manager would n't do anything about it 
 we joked that her job title was internet quality control '' because she more-or-less sent personal email and played on myspace all day to which when she overheard literally went to the manager in tears 
 then one day i got a rather large jar of candy as a gift and she just about <unk> consumed half of it which pissed me off good i mean <unk> - ask 
 then later that week i brought in a dozen <unk> and she ate half of them on her own 
 upon putting the facts together our web designer <unk> and i decided to fuel the fire in something we called operation : <unk> '' where we each in turn brought in a large bag of candy to fill up my jar as fast as she could empty it 
 in the course of three months she put on 20 pounds 
 in a years time she <unk> and along with being a crank she suddenly complained about a <unk> problem '' 
 several times a week we provided her <unk> and snacks of every kinds until her boyfriend dumped her which was about eight months into the project and she had to get a new wardrobe 
 we lucked out because she was rather oblivious but we had more diabolical measures lined up if she stopped eating the candy along the lines of mixing in <unk> to the <unk> <unk> she was using and things of that nature 
 that started in 2004 and she 's still big to this day saw her on facebook years back and smiled at our <unk> 
 still single to this day and i would like to think that we had something to do with <unk> is a long story but hopefully my sweet sweet revenge will give you a fraction of the satisfaction it did to me 
 *** a couple of years ago i participated in a student exchange program in belgium and obviously i had to quickly find an appartement after my arrival 
 i was very lucky and found an incredible offer : a nice big loft with a roof garden reasonably cheap and very close to my university 
 the only downside was that current <unk> was not the official landlord : he had a long-term lease but was forbidden by contract to <unk> the apartement himself 
 he was himself going on a student exchange program and had to quickly find someone to rent his <unk> which is how he explained the rent was so cheap <unk> seemed like a wealthy <unk> guy so i didn’t mind having an <unk> the <unk> deal with him 
 this ended up being my demise 
 when i moved in the apartment was not in excellent condition 
 he basically left the apartment as anyone who leaves for a long trip would have : dishes <unk> away and no laundry on the floor but otherwise not cleaned up 
 all the utilities were included in the rent which was a big plus for me considering that it was january and electricity prices in belgium are pretty high 
 the central heating was broken but the landlord was <unk> <unk> to buy me two small electric heaters that i could use in the living room and in my bedroom 
 strangely enough my landlord had some kind of <unk> / disease which stopped him from having a sense of smell he warned me his girlfriend would be able to smell if i had smoked in the apartment 
 i never smoked in the apartment although i am a big smoker because the landlord told me he was very opposed to smoking 
 as is customary in many european countries he had asked for a deposit of around 1600 euros 2 <unk> rent to be paid back in full on the condition that there were no damages 
 although not in a written contract i still give him the deposit because he left all his appliances including cd / <unk> collection and speakers furniture television <unk> etc 
 which i considered to be collateral 
 as months went by i paid my rent to his mother still in belgium on time had a great time and did no damage to the apartment 
 i had a minimal but courteous email relationship to the landlord which never complained about anything i might have done 
 the landlord came back a couple of days before i was preparing to move out 
 he came to visit the apartment and check for damages and i was expecting him to hand me a brown envelope with the 1600 euros he owed me after he had noticed there were no damages whatsoever 
 when he entered he had a clearly fake and exaggerated disgusted look on his face 
 he explained that the appartement was dirty and that i needed to clean it before i received the money which was not part of our verbal agreement 
 mind you i had cleaned the appartement entirely to the best of my <unk> and to an extent any landlord would have found more than reasonable 
 he proceeded to show me all the wall <unk> almost all of them already there dust under the oven yes under the oven <unk> on some pipes under the sink etc 
 basically he wanted me to clean the apartement as if he was about to sell it and remember the apartment was definitely not cleaned when i moved in 
 he offered to pay and go get some cleaning products for me which he would bring back shortly 
 i assumed he would also help me clean with his girlfriend but nope 
 he came back and basically ordered my girlfriend and i around like <unk> while he and his girlfriend were doing nothing 
 this was still to date the most humiliating frustrating experience of my life 
 i knew that i had to obey his <unk> because i would never get my 1600 euros back if i didn’t 
 i probably could have legally challenged him somehow but i was leaving the country a few days later and i <unk> to swallow my pride and move on with my life 
 scumbag landlord after 2-3 hours seemed pleased with my work and instructed me to meet him at a <unk> the next day to hand over the cash 
 i arrived at the meeting early the next day hungover as hell ready to get my cash and get the hell out of belgium my flight was the next day 
 he did not have the cash with him 
 after i left the day before he had called the utility company and realised that he had an outstanding statement of around 2000 euros 
 apparently those little electric heaters consumed energy like motherfuckers 
 i could / should have anticipated this but as the utilities were <unk> and i had never through of checking the <unk> of my electricity <unk> on the meter which i had to unscrew a <unk> of wood to access anyways 
 scumbag landlord after having made me clean his apartment like a little bitch was asking for the 400 euros i owed him 
 he himself had always paid the <unk> from the central gas heating and did not <unk> a rise in <unk> bills after giving me the two electric heaters 
 that son of a bitch was even threatening to show up at the airport the next day and stop me from leaving if i didn’t 
 after myself calling the utility company we went together to their offices and realised the balance was actually something around 1400 euros not the <unk> mistake 
 i only received 200 euros in return 
 i had never been so furious in my life and could barely stop shaking for the next hours 
 i wanted so much to get revenge but i only had one night left in the apartment 
 i was also legitimately scared that he would show up at the airport i should mention that he was a big guy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 i had to somehow delay the effects of the revenge so that they would be only <unk> after i was gone 
 this excluded the obvious damages to the property which was my initial idea 
 that’s when all the pieces fit together in my mind and my evil plot was hatched 
 after sharing the idea with my girlfriend we went to the nearest fish store and bought something like 10 euros worth of fish leftovers usually purchased to make fish stock or <unk> my best estimate is something like 2-3 <unk> of fish bones etc 
 for the next couple of hours i <unk> the fish with a lot of water <unk> out the <unk> and filled up spray bottles with a <unk> but very liquid fish mixture 
 i sprayed that fishy water everywhere but i really mean everywhere 
 under the over behind the furniture on the floor the walls the ceiling between the drawers of his desk under his mattress and even on the clothing he had originally left in storage when i moved in 
 there is no way he could smell the fish and he probably would not have received complaints from the neighbours until they were rotten and stinking out the whole building 
 to this day i do not know how my fishy revenge turned out 
 i can only imagine that his friends told him he smelled like shit and/or that his apartment smelled of rotting sea <unk> by which time it would have been too late to reverse anyways 
 it probably cost him a <unk> of money to professionally clean his house and i sincerely hope he is still paranoid about smelling like fish but nobody wants to admit it to him 
 tldr : scumbag landlord took advantage of me and did not give me back my deposit 
 knowing he has no sense of smell i took revenge by spraying fishy water all over the apartment which he probably realised way after it smelled of rotten fish 
 as the title implies this is not my prorevenge 
 a friend of mine recently bought a house 
 his hobby is pouring silly amounts of money into <unk> beat ass old cars and right now he 's got a <unk> ~~alpha~~ alfa <unk> 75 on blocks in his driveway 
 thus he parks his daily driver on the street 
 there is plenty of parking on the street as nearly everyone parks in the driveway but every few days this woman with a <unk> sticker on the windshield of her white 90 's mustang parks right in front of his house before he gets home from work 
 one day he pulls up behind her right as she 's getting out of her car 
 he says excuse me <unk> 
 i was wondering if you would mind not parking in front of my house 
 i like to park here '' 
 she responds with tons of attitude this is n't <unk> parking spot 
 you do n't own the street '' 
 he 's annoyed at her being rude for no reason but wanting to get his way he keeps calm and says i know 
 it 's just there 's plenty of parking on this street 
 i 'm asking you as a favor '' 
 yeah 
 well i do n't know you and i 'll park wherever i want 
 get rid of that pile of trash and park in your driveway if it 's so important to you '' 
 to be fair the ~~alpha~~ alfa does look like a pile of trash but still this woman was pretty unbelievable 
 thing is my friend works in private security and has contacts in the local pd 
 he calls his buddy and asks her to run the lady 's plates getting her address 
 then he waits 
 she continues to park in front of his house but he does n't make it home from work early enough to actually see her 
 a couple of weeks later though the stars <unk> and he is out getting his mail when she pulls up 
 he walks over to her and says excuse me 
 i just wanted to ask you again to park somewhere else 
 just 15 feet forward 
 i 'd really appreciate it '' 
 look asshole i 'm going to park here because it 's across the street from my friend 's house 
 deal with it '' 
 her friend is a <unk> douche who <unk> a nice house from his dad and proceeded to neglect it until it was the street <unk> 
 listen lady this really is n't cool 
 it 's not like i come to 123 example <unk> 
 and park in front of your house ... '' her eyes got really wide and she immediately got back in her car and moved it down the block 
 he has n't had any trouble with her since 
 i had posted this earlier on under a different title in /r/pettyrevenge 
 however i felt it was rather extreme for a pettyrevenge post so i put it down here as well 
 anyways after seeing this post about how op got revenge on an obnoxious shit and his friends during halloween i thought i 'd post my <unk> story on here as well 
 now it 's pretty long so please bear with me 
 <unk> feel free to skip right down to the revenge part 
 **background** in the area where i live there 's this community service centre and during halloween we get to volunteer to take part in haunted houses haunted rooms would be more accurate because there 's multiple groups and we only get a large room to work our magic in as staff members 
 the main visitors are around <unk> meaning that our rooms have to be scary but not too scary the first year this happened the workers ended up with a lot of crying kids on hand so the years afterwards had limits on how scary it could be 
 well back in 2013 there was this <unk> year old shithead we 'll call him fuckass who started coming 
 he kept on going into haunted houses and making really snide comments 
 the makeup looked obviously fake what do you expect we 're not professionals we 're just a bunch of teenagers who want to bring the halloween spirit alive none of it was scary the actors were too young and even a room filled with fluffy pillows was <unk> ... those were just some of the remarks 
 we were n't happy but we shrugged and let it slide figuring he would n't be back 
 boy were we wrong 
 2014 rolls over and he comes back <unk> the same shit 
 *** what 's more when he got out of the attraction he 'd tell others what was in it and ruin the entire damn thing 
 come 2015 and i was team leader this year 
 my group mates were all dreading it because we knew he 'd probably come around and do it all over again 
 sure i have a few skills i did n't show but we ca n't have cards flying around and people popping out of nowhere constitute the entire house can we 
 however as a <unk> veteran i 've met quite a few people over the course of those four years 
 one of them was this guy who we 'll call tommy and he was a <unk> at woodwork 
 for example on my first year doing this 2011 we had this spot where there would be a <unk> rising from the grave which called for an actual coffin 
 there 's no way we 're buying one and he was the one who made it from thin boards of wood a week before the entire thing started 
 <unk> now tommy was also a <unk> clever person who did not appreciate his experience for the past two years being ruined 
 so he flipped a switch and changed from his usual polite gentleman mode to his <unk> bastard with extra bastard filling mode and when i contacted him asking him to join my group he accepted <unk> a plan 
 during the time between 2013 and 2015 he had taken his woodwork to a whole new level 
 forget the <unk> he could make a table with so many <unk> and secrets that it would take an entire month to discover them 
 and he was going to do exactly that 
 in addition to tommy i had also recruited a couple of other people who had been on the receiving end of fuckass douchebaggery and wanted to get back at him 
 then another group heard what we were doing and decided to join up with our team meaning that we were given the largest room which was at least four times larger than the other rooms 
 our now <unk> strong group put our heads together and we plotted 
 coming up with scary sights well beyond what we usually would do at the centre 
 there would be no fake <unk> in place of bodies nor would there be any tissue paper <unk> as <unk> and <unk> 
 we were determined to do the best we could and give this asshole his due 
 for the month leading up to halloween we worked as hard as we could to get it all done 
 recording sounds shopping <unk> over google docs ... we worked our asses off on it just to make sure we could deliver that karmic kick up his backside 
 finally halloween rolled over 
 i met up with tommy and several others at the centre especially early well before any of the other groups were even here 
 we spent the next three hours getting the place set up and by cleverly <unk> up the black <unk> of cloth we were provided with we turned a large room partitioned by <unk> into a <unk> dark horror where we waited to give patrons the scare of their lives 
 after a quick lunch the <unk> arrived four of who were <unk> a large table 
 needless to say the table attracted quite a few stares 
 holy shit ... what the fuck is that '' 
 oh just a surprise that we have in store for the <unk> 
 tommy gave the people asking his signature 'i 'm about to wreck some serious shit grin 
 as the hours rolled by our justice squad <unk> like an army of ants 
 the makeup artists started working their magic and slowly <unk> injuries <unk> on our actors 
 from <unk> to scars from flesh rotted away to reveal bones to mangled <unk> and missing chunks of flesh they either looked like they just came out of an accident or could pass themselves off as the <unk> <unk> dead come back to <unk> the living 
 alright i might have exaggerated a bit but you get the idea 
 meanwhile back in the haunted room we went and having checked that it was partitioned like we wanted and all the decorations were here started laying out everything needed 
 first we divided the materials based on what went into which section 
 then we all split apart and <unk> the sections we were responsible for before <unk> again at the table which tommy had <unk> while we were n't around 
 tommy turns to me a smirk <unk> his face 
 <unk> should we tell them about the table '' 
 i nod and tommy grins 
 so guys as you can see there 's several dishes silverware and those fancy <unk> all laid out on the table right '' 
 cue a round of uncertain nods 
 tommy reaches over lifts up one of the <unk> and everyone is greeted with a head on a plate 
 eyes closed shaven head blood around the neck 
 then the 'head opens their eyes and lets out a shriek 
 pandemonium ensues 
 the rest of the team let out yells of alarm as the 'head laughing disappears from view 
 moments later the 'head with the body attached <unk> out from under the table before revealing that the <unk> was not actually a plate but was painted on the cloth itself 
 peering over reveals a hole in both the cloth and the table itself with two slats near the bottom of the table 
 these slats were <unk> so the actor portraying the 'head could slide the slats apart stick his head through the hole then slide them back to complete the illusion 
 a little further along the table there 's a similar but smaller <unk> for someone else to do the same with their arm and on top of that hole we plopped on a pile of fake arms before <unk> them with a shit ton of fake blood to camouflage the arm 
 fast forward a couple hours and it 's now thirty minutes before game time 
 the actors have all <unk> their hunger and have also run through the entire thing a couple of times 
 now they 're just chatting and <unk> around 
 tommy and i are worried though 
 what if fuckass <unk> turn up and all our work was in vain 
 i sneak out and hide behind one of the numerous <unk> hung up in the hallway leading to the corridor with rooms where the visitors are gathered 
 and from my vantage point among our sea of faces i spot a familiar one 
 jackpot 
 i run back as quickly and quietly as i can telling tommy 
 tommy literally jumps up from his seat and calls everyone together 
 he tells them to relieve themselves put their stuff away and get their shit sorted out because they 're going to start business 
 five minutes before opening everyone 's getting into position and exchanging small talk 
 i myself am <unk> one of the makeup artists to a railing she volunteered to be one of the victims in a slaughterhouse scare zone when we hear commotion outside 
 i go out to take a look and see fuckass as well as some of his scumbag friends <unk> the team leaders of one of the other haunted rooms 
 i step in and tell him to fuck off and he responds by going <unk> i 'm not scared of your stupid attraction 
 i saw how lame it was last year 
 <unk> 's see you say that after you get through it 
 * **revenge** the haunted rooms event last for two three if there 's a lot of people hours and during this time we got several visitors 
 we gave them the normal version of the journey where we do n't pull off the really horrible <unk> yet 
 those are reserved for a certain <unk> 
 the journey also <unk> slightly with each one 
 we arranged the <unk> so that we can have more than one potential route 
 for example certain rooms are skipped out if there are young children like the mad slaughterhouse the order of rooms shown is mixed around and sometimes the rooms are not seen but heard 
 it 's never really the same with our house 
 after around an hour of scaring we get a little rest break 
 the lights are on the windows on the door are covered with black pieces of paper and we 're all chilling 
 then there is loud <unk> on the door 
 i move one of the pieces aside and see fuckass pounding on the door his cohorts snickering as well 
 we were pissed 
 i mean who the fuck does that 
 we decide fuck it if he wo n't treat us with respect then we wo n't hold back on him either 
 the guy at the door tells them to be more patient and that they would <unk> to go in as soon as they us <unk> were ready 
 they lay off the knocking and we spend the rest of the break preparing for his arrival 
 the only thing fuckass and co. saw were one or two of us running out to the toilets and getting some water 
 finally the trap was set 
 fuckass and his friends <unk> in completely unaware of what lay in wait for them like a <unk> to bait 
 the first thing they noticed was the <unk> drifting out of a <unk> 
 the <unk> who is playing the role of a hideous old crone is faced away from them <unk> over and muttering stuff 
 she turns to them and tells them the story ... with a twist 
 instead of the usual introduction to how they should make sure to obey the rules she just says something about how they should be careful for <unk> things evil things <unk> ahead 
 enter at your risk ... '' fuckass and co. shrug and walk on through the <unk> of <unk> formed by the <unk> pouring from the buckets above 
 now this is where it starts to <unk> from the normal path 
 remember my skills 
 because as soon as they clear the <unk> the first thing they see are several cards coming at them at as high a speed as i could make them 
 of course i aimed to miss - but barely and so that it <unk> past their head 
 what the hell was that '' 
 <unk> # 1 asks 
 oh man up 
 i was right this is still lame '' 
 fuckass laughs 
 <unk> is that a slight silver of anxiety i hear in your voice 
 * well they got through most of the <unk> 
 i think they started to crack when they got to the mad slaughterhouse there was fake blood and actual pig organs in there as well as a couple of people playing victims and from there on it only got worse and worse 
 by the time they get to the dining hall they 're starting to shake and sweat visibly 
 the <unk> played by tommy invites them to sit down and ignoring their sounds of protest shows them to their seats 
 then he takes out a silver bell and rings it - and lo and behold the <unk> people with their heads resting in plates of rotting 'food come alive 
 <unk> <unk> they look around blank looks in their eyes 
 i think i saw one of the friends pale when a <unk> stared them in the eye 
 tommy lifts open some of the covers on the dishes 
 <unk> fingernails <unk> salad <unk> with <unk> vinegar boiled heart yes it was a real pig 's heart <unk> <unk> ... tommy took great pleasure in describing each and every one of the dishes in graphic detail taking pleasure in making the fucker squirm 
 then after all that fuss only one lid remains uncovered 
 at this tommy puts on an air of excitement rubbing his hands and muttering to himself how the last dish would give them 'the greatest surprise of their lives 
 the zombies <unk> and groan taking the cutlery and <unk> on the desk with it 
 tommy slowly <unk> takes hold of the lid and the <unk> get more and more frantic 
 finally in one swift movement tommy <unk> the cover away and yells <unk> 
 fuckass and his cohorts catch sight of a shaven sheet white head with blood around the neck 
 but only for a second because the next second the head has opened their eyes and let out an <unk> shriek 
 <unk> unfortunately for fuckass tommy sat him down so that when the 'head comes alive they are facing his seat looking right into his eyes 
 * what ensued was possibly the most glorious moments of my life 
 fuckass and his friends let out loud screams of their own and knock over their chairs in their <unk> to get out 
 however a real arm snakes out from the pile of arms and swipes at them making them scream even louder the zombies <unk> 
 tommy yells 'i hope you enjoyed your dinner '' 
 as they run past 
 they 're in the last room now 
 they 're looking around and they ca n't see the door which is covered by a black curtain 
 i wait until they 're looking in the wrong direction then quietly draw back the curtain and hide 
 when they see it they practically stumbled towards it 
 they 're so focused on the door they do n't notice me sneaking out of my hiding spot and assuming a position near the door 
 i hope you enjoyed your stay '' 
 <unk> <unk> i still remember the surprised <unk> they let out when i made my <unk> debut 
 needless to say after being on the receiving end of what we call 'the great scare of 2015 he never tried to <unk> up any trouble for the rest of the time he was here 
 **tl dr** : when you are such an asshole that an entire haunted house <unk> and actually creates features specifically to <unk> you it might be time to <unk> your behavior 
 **edit** : changed tl dr to the contents of <unk> 's <unk> i work in a well known chicken restaurant chain in <unk> and on a monday and tuesday two guys with down 's syndrome work during the day shift 
 i suppose to give them a bit of money and something to do 
 they are two of the nicest people i know and have such happy nice personalities and wish no harm on anybody 
 well earlier today these private school <unk> assholes <unk> in giggling about something 
 a coworker of mine heard them doing down syndrome impressions and obviously did not give a flying fuck if anyone around them could hear them 
 so anyway they order their food and one of them orders an extra spicy burger 
 well we soaked the bread in extra hot sauce <unk> the <unk> in extra hot and basically made a burger so hot he 's gon na be shitting fire for the next week 
 he didnt finish it was all red and had tears coming down his face 
 we were all laughing as he left the restaurant full of shame 
 tl dr guy laughed at someone with down 's syndrome i make his food too spicy for him to eat leaves embarrassed with all his friends and the staff laughing at <unk> and foremost let me emphasize that this story is entirely centered around my friend and his family 
 i had <unk> involvement in this whatsoever 
 <unk> names have been changed 
 the story begins with my best friend otto winning 4 tickets on a cruise ship to cozumel mexico 
 he first offered to me but i was single at the time and to quote myself did n't want to waste a cruise ship <unk> '' 
 so he reaches out to his sister jane 
 jane is ecstatic and asks if her boyfriend steve can be invited in tow and otto gives the <unk> 
 so it 's otto and his fiancee claire his sister jane and her boyfriend steve 
 again this story was told to me and i 'm repeating back to the best of my <unk> 
 the cruise is about 8 days and for the first 3 everything is going <unk> there 's plenty of drinks plenty of dancing karaoke <unk> food and <unk> and there 's plenty of time left before even reaching cozumel 
 everything 's going well until the 3rd night when jane knocks on otto 's door crying and shaking 
 she did n't look that bad since she wrecked her car that one time '' otto told me the morning after 
 jane was <unk> and very reluctant to give any details but she had asked to sleep with otto and claire that night 
 she cited the reason being that she and steve had been fighting and did n't want to be in the same room as him 
 red flags were waved but otto was pretty cool with steve at that point so he waited to gather more details 
 the next day claire and jane talked at length and jane finally admitting that apparently fighting '' <unk> into rape '' 
 steve had forced her down while they were both tipsy and jane wanted to sleep it off 
 otto was pissed but he was also fucking <unk> 
 they were going into a foreign country and there were opportunities 
 however it was established that jane would be sleeping with claire and otto would be rooming with steve 
 otto was n't happy but my buddy 's fucking <unk> he looked the fucker in the eye and smiled knowing full well that steve would get his 
 steve on the other hand was told that jane just needed to cool off '' and that nothing was <unk> he 's not naive but he bought it 
 day 4 and they arrive in cozumel 
 as soon as they step off otto and claire tell steve to give them all of his belongings 
 steve gets suspicious but is <unk> when claire explains that this place is loaded with <unk> who know how to steal from tourists 
 we 'll hang back '' 
 steve went off with jane having conspired with otto and <unk> he had only $ 200 which was quickly borrowed by jane who asked sweetly if steve could lend it to her while she looked for a nice pair of shades 
 steve never saw the money again nor has he seen jane as far as i know 
 his cell phone 
 it thrown into the gulf 
 his wallet 's cards were cut up and tossed in the trash while his cash was used to buy lunch and some <unk> 
 his id card which would get him back into the ship 
 lost with his passport 
 in the gulf 
 i do n't quite know the details about how a missing passenger is dealt with 
 otto did n't give me any details on the matter but he did make it a point to tell me that steve did n't speak spanish and he 'll be there long enough for someone to go all <unk> '' on his ass hopefully '' 
 while i suspect otto bribed the staff to count steve as present i 'd rather not <unk> my best friend for something i do n't know nor do i want to 
 the rest of the trip was decent but nothing like a <unk> jane was in bad shape the rest of the way and most of the time was spent with her helping her calm down and talking her through her issues 
 there were drinks some gambling in the <unk> and some really fun moments but steve had left his mark and the return home was a welcomed sight 
 bonus : steve still has n't been heard from while jane 's been seeing a grief counselor and making <unk> to move on from the trauma steve caused her 
 i got to be the best man at otto 's wedding and claire is expecting her first child with otto in <unk> months 
 **tl <unk> best friend 's sister gets raped rapist is left stranded in a foreign country 
 once again this submission is not my own encounter 
 names and locations have been changed for <unk> 's sake 
 i 'm <unk> this story to the best of my knowledge and ability and apologize for any important details left <unk> for those of you who read my last story i figured i 'd share this one because i had an update 
 i 'll get to that after the story though 
 alright so my friend dave 's little brother always had a gang around him which we tended to call the fiends '' 
 there was a line in fear and <unk> in las vegas where they 're bumbling around high on <unk> and the character says something like you <unk> '' 
 when he 's referring to the other character 
 it stuck and became our little insulting name for the group of habitual drunk 16 year olds 
 we honestly used to sit around and watch them because they were amusing 
 for this i am using the real <unk> we knew them for at the time 
 seriously you 'll see why i had to ad this disclaimer in a moment 
 anyway there are 3 main players in this story 
 first we 'll call rabbit because it was his nickname i have no idea why 
 he was a <unk> little bastard who was sure he was smarter than everyone else around him in spite of great evidence to the contrary 
 next was a kid we knew as monk i have no idea why this was his nickname either was was generally a cool guy 
 always had a <unk> on hand because 1990s and was pretty well known as being almost impossible to anger ... ok maybe that was why we called him monk 
 next was monk 's girlfriend the head monster i know exactly why she had this nickname who was a pretty nice girl 
 yes she did earn the nickname when she was single but she was totally <unk> to and in love with monk 
 cute too really 
 so one day the fiends are all out getting something or other probably cheap beer and pot that 's like 40 % lawn <unk> and it 's just a few people at the house 
 dave and i are in his room the head monster and rabbit are in the living room downstairs 
 dave and i decide to take a break from ... probably <unk> 
 something for the <unk> i ca n't remember 
 upon walking down stairs we look into the living room and see rabbit laying on top of thm and trying to remove her pants 
 now she appears to be unconscious at the time so he was n't really having any issues 
 when he sees us he instantly gets up and <unk> out of the house as fast as he can 
 running is what this kid was best at because getting his ass handed to him was the second best thing he was good at 
 we would have chased him down but i 've always been a fatass and dave was checking to make sure thm was ok. she was out cold and we being stupid teens reasoned it was better to zip up her clothing and not tell her what happened 
 we figured it was better than waking a drunk and telling her hey someone just tried to rape you '' because once again we was morons 
 we did however decide to tell monk in case he wanted our help beating the shit out of rabbit 
 we told him what we saw and he <unk> slightly at the information 
 he only did that for a moment or two before smiling at us and saying hey do n't worry about it 
 i can handle it '' and then wandering off 
 cue <unk> <unk> an amount of time later 
 it 's safe to assume at this point rabbit somehow thought he had outsmarted us or ran too fast to be seen because he started showing up around the house again to hang out with dave 's little brother 
 he acted like nothing had happened and chatted like he was n't a gigantic piece of shit 
 so one day we 're sitting around with the fiends watching something on the tv 
 rabbit is casually sitting on the edge of the coffee table talking shit about someone who was n't there at the moment and dave and i were just kind of <unk> we could break his knees 
 cue monk showing up and things <unk> like this 
 monk : hey dave hey <unk> 
 good to see ya '' 
 <unk> directly over to <unk> monk : hi rabbit '' 
 <unk> up his <unk> and <unk> rabbit so hard in the teeth with the truck that blood <unk> somehow ended up around a corner in another <unk> monk : sorry about the mess dave 
 take care guys '' 
 <unk> and leaves the house without saying another <unk> 
 the best part of that is that rabbit was such an asshole that no one in the room questioned why it was done 
 as soon as we heard the front door close everyone in the room burst out laughing while rabbit was on the floor crying 
 never saw the shit weasel again after that day 
 update for people that read the last story i posted 
 i actually found and got into contact with dave 
 it literally boiled down to me searching through everyone on facebook with his name and looking for the weird ass bands we both liked in his interests 
 he 's doing well family and all that and is far far away from that house 
 edit : shit left out the my favorite <unk> is a throw away account so i don’t link this story to my original account also sorry for the grammar because english isn’t my first language and i’m <unk> on my phone 
 a little backstory first : my dad was one of the first geologist to go and work in the gulf in that time <unk> was just a desert so we a very well off family my older brother have <unk> and can’t talk caused by <unk> during birth 
 every time we get back to our <unk> we go back to rural town where my parents were born and raised and away from the city because traffic noises always made my brother jump and his muscles <unk> for few seconds if he heard a loud noise like car horn 
 it was summer vacation my dad went to the city to do something related to work there and mom left to visit a relative in the hospital so me and my older brother were left to the babysitter don’t know how old i was back then but i was still in elementary school 
 so the babysitter decided to put my brother in wheel chair and go for walk around the town and visit the park there while i decided to stay and play around in front of the house with a friend 
 the babysitter came early and red eyed because she was crying apparently when she was taking my brother to the park some fat little fuck had some fireworks which made my brother jump and <unk> the kid noticed that and found it funny by throwing fireworks toward my brother and making him jump then calling him a retard 
 the babysitter told him to stop and tried to chase him only to run and come back again throwing fireworks in the end the fucker managed to throw plastic bottle and hit my brother head then my brother broke down crying 
 the babysitter managed to catch that little fat fuck but his mother who also massive fat fuck told her not to touch her kid the babysitter told her that her son was bullying my disabled brother the fat fuck said that she was to blame and she should keep that thing inside the house this was the moment where the babysitter started crying and took my brother home 
 after finishing telling me the story my brother cried not because of the bullying but because he felt he could n't defend the baby <unk> i was kid back then and my heart sunk inside 
 now i mentioned that we were very well off and because my brother liked <unk> so we had every console out there from <unk> to nintendo and <unk> system with ton of games and big <unk> tv and my brother loved to watch more than play so we always had kids come to our home to play with us one of them was our neighbor kid who was freshman in high school and very close to my brother so we going to call him “my brother from another mother” mbfam 
 so i went and told him the whole story and he was furious he went and called some kids to gather information about this little prick apparently one of his classmate knew he is sadistic fuck who liked to take <unk> and put them in front of stray dogs if you don’t know stray dogs will attack any dog who come near their territory 
 so one of the kids went to his house and told him that they found a dog and he should come and see it the naïve little shit went straight to the trap where we send him to area where there is no houses and people around 
 me mbfam and couple of kids get him surrounded mbfam said i heard you bullied my brother from another mother” and he pushed him the kid said in <unk> up voice <unk> mbfam said <unk> want me to stop now 
 why are you gon na cry 
 did you stop when he <unk> then another kid pushed him every time he wanted to get up a kid pushed him to the ground then one of the pushed into a puddle of mud then took off the fat kids shorts so to looks like he shat himself and all kids started laughing <unk> why did you shit <unk> the fat kid started <unk> and ran straight to his house 
 30 mins later he got his mom banging the door and screaming like crazy mad screaming the babysitter was scared <unk> and couldn’t dare to open the door that until the sheriff came it must somebody called him because it was a freaking circus in front our house a fat bitch and her spawn and shit ton of kids i felt like all the kids of the town gathered in front our house 
 the sheriff came to see what the fuck is happening of course the fat whale started to scream incoherent word saying words like <unk> little <unk> <unk> poor <unk> then the babysitter opened the door and told her side of the story how the kid started throwing fireworks and making my brother uncomfortable then the whale interrupted <unk> the bitch shouldn’t took that retarded outside the <unk> 
 in this moment the sheriff said <unk> your fucking mouth 
 he isn’t retarded he is physically disabled and he smarter than you and your son so go back to your fucking home before i arrest you for domestic <unk> 
 everybody could see the fear inside the whale eyes she took her spawn back with the cheers of kids all laughing around her 
 now the kid have been known of kid who shat himself 
 my parents came back home i don’t know what exactly happened but the father came to apologize and their house was getting vandalized every day for a week or something 
 years later i came back to our little town for relative funeral i <unk> up with mbfam and he told me this : & gt the father of the little kid was a truck driver who was never home 
 & gt the kids was spoiled by his mother and even in high school he was a little shit 
 & gt the father died so the kid go his inheritance ransacked the the house stealing his mother <unk> or anything expensive in the house 
 & gt his mom was left with little to no money so the community gathered some cash to help her 
 & gt she refused to rent the house or sell it and move to small apartment 
 & gt her house is complete dump with no electricity or running water 
 & gt nobody know what happened to the kid 
 tried posting this in petty revenge but it got removed 
 i guess it might not be very petty since i <unk> this guy haha 
 i run a youtube <unk> called <unk> pranks 
 a <unk> sent me the callback number to one of these indian scammers and asked me to prank them 
 i decided to call them as a fellow indian man pretending to fall for their scam and see how they 'd react 
 here 's the video 
 i had so much fun messing with this guys head he gradually gets more and more <unk> until i get the guy to curse at me at hang up 
 if you guys get any calls like this and they give you a callback number or any other obvious scam please send it my way 
 it was extremely fun for me to mess with this guy 's head and i definitely want to do it more often 
 got any suggestions for what types of scams i should try to expose next 
 : a few years ago i was going through a series of shitty events regarding my girlfriend and her <unk> turns out she had slept with one of my friends and also blew another one of the people i knew 
 a few days after finishing things she tells me about all the other times she had cheated or at least all the times she remembers and even laughs about it to my face i 'm with my friends drinking later that night when my ex texts me asking to have her bikini back that she left at my house ... lightbulb 
 we have my buddies girlfriend drive to pick up the bikini and more beer while we stay at the house 
 now the weather had been below freezing for the past couple of days so everything outside was frozen solid 
 our night progressed and eventually nature had to take it 's course this is when my revenge began 
 after half a night of <unk> drinking my two friends and i had become quite full of urine so not wanting to waste such a golden resource we decided to save most of our piss that night in a one gallon ziplock bag 
 with the bikini inside the bag and the three of us peeing at regular intervals by the next morning we woke to find our vessel had become a solid frozen mass off different levels of urine with a stark contrast between two of the layers '' it was a pretty nasty sight to behold 
 not only was the night with my friends cathartic but i felt a sort of pride in the piss bag knowing that my ex would think i 'm a fucking lunatic and hopefully wo n't try to contact me ever again 
 since i had n't replied to the text my ex sent on day one by day two she had sent me another to which i rather <unk> responded a few hours later with it 's on your porch '' 
 i had been back at my house not ten minutes before i had a call from my ex in a seething tone your mother will hear about this '' which i thought was rather petty and funny since my mom would n't care since she did n't like or trust my ex to begin with 
 once off the phone with my ex i get a call from my mom having he tell me all about how angry x was and how she did n't do anything to warrant <unk> 
 this should probably go to r/pettyrevenge but i felt like i piss is a little too gross ... sometimes the easiest way to deal with an asshat is to get accountants and the government involved 
 it all started out normally enough 
 through some acquaintances my so and i met a couple that 'd just recently moved close to where we were living 
 we attended their house warming and spent a few other nights hanging out 
 it 'd really be nothing to write home about if my so had n't come to me asking me why the guy in this other couple messaged him letting him know that his girlfriend was convinced that i was trying to steal her boyfriend 
 if that sentence left you confused i was too 
 the girlfriend did n't say a word to me but spun some tale to her boyfriend who also did n't say anything to me but started messaging my so this nonsense 
 the boyfriend ... <unk> does n't describe him but it starts to come close 
 if he was the last man on earth i 'd become very familiar with my right hand 
 as you might imagine it 's hard to definitely prove that you did n't do something and it was n't just flirting that i apparently engaged in according to them 
 i was apparently running my mouth about all sorts of stuff and causing issues for them 
 i apparently told nameless others that he was cheating on her and that she was cheating on him and that she was only in it for the money and on and on 
 i 'm saying nameless '' because they were never produced 
 ... because it never happened 
 i 'm convinced that it was something she made up 
 it became a they said - she said with my so in the middle 
 redditors i honestly did n't do any of the shit that i got accused of 
 it was all catching me totally off guard 
 i told them to piss off and broke all ties 
 two months later i get a message asking me why i was sending snail mail letters to the boyfriend 's mother implying that the girlfriend was a <unk> and a whore 
 i did n't know the mother or the address and thought that the girlfriend was a <unk> but not a <unk> 
 this time i 'd really had enough 
 i did n't want them and their drama making regular <unk> in my life 
 a conversation that i 'd overheard between the boyfriend and another guy popped into my head while i was seeing red 
 the boyfriend owned his own company and had been bragging about how he did n't pay his taxes and neither did his company 
 i know my way around the internet a little bit so i started researching him and his company 
 i took screenshots of what i found which included two different instances of him <unk> to the tax <unk> on social media sites 
 i read far too many comment threads and posts of his and discovered his presence on some eye raising sites in the process 
 i took what i had and both mailed hard copies to a few local irs criminal investigator agents as well as emailed it to them 
 after i was done looking up the boyfriend and his companies i started looking up the information of people in the local irs office who would be tasked with investigating him 
 i <unk> with one of the irs agents briefly and then there was a silent pause in which i 'd considered it all going nowhere 
 and then i heard it through the <unk> ... irs agents had shown up at his home 
 they had investigated him and his company 
 together he owed something close to $ 2 million in back taxes 
 it 'd been years since he 'd paid both 
 he ended up having to <unk> his lifestyle a bit to start making the payments 
 i know he 'd started hiding some of his assets by putting them in her name so i know that the girlfriend got dragged into the investigation too 
 i think that it all freaked his girlfriend out and stressed their relationship because she ended up leaving him shortly after it all started 
 i still honestly do n't understand what the point of all of the accusations was 
 my so does n't have any <unk> either 
 i know i probably should have directed more of my efforts towards the girlfriend but he was the one who <unk> and <unk> gave me some nice ammunition to extract some revenge against the both of them 
 he 's now working to pay what he owes and she 's now living at home and working in retail 
 they do n't talk 
 i have n't heard a peep from either one of them for the last almost 2 years so i 'm satisfied with how things ended 
 they do n't know that it was me who give the irs much of what they <unk> long time ago no just 20 years ago in a <unk> far far away no just 5 streets over i rented a nice big flat in a nice old <unk> house 
 house was foreclosed but the stupid property management company that managed it for the bank did everything wrong 
 first of all it didn’t notify me of the change of landlord so i kept paying the rent to the old landlord who did not cash the <unk> 
 after 6 months i get sued for not paying the rent 
 in court when it’s my turn to speak i ask <unk> the fuck you are 
 my lease says mr so-and-so and you’re not <unk> 
 — <unk> they could not produce proof that they officially notified of the rent transfer 
 — case dismissed 
 said the judge 
 of course i received the <unk> rent transfer <unk> after <unk> oh well 
 i was stupid and young at the time and i did not think it could be that when the registered mail came in and i stupidly took it 
 it was nice while it <unk> but still 6 months <unk> then the stupid property management decided to sell the house for the bank 
 it’s one of those typical <unk> houses with the big stairs outside and they put the “for sale” sign on <unk> <unk> 
 at $ <unk> i printed huge “sold” sign on <unk> <unk> and when i come home late at night i stick one on the “for sale” sign 
 looks totally official 
 it takes them 4-5 weeks to notice the “sold” sticker and they <unk> it off 
 of course 2-3 days later another “sold” goes up and stays for another 3-4 weeks 
 rinse <unk> and repeat 
 it took the bastards 9 months to sell the <unk> coworker told me this story today and i asked if i could post it here for you guys to enjoy 
 sorry if it 's more of a /r/pettyrevenge story but it seemed a bit more involved 
 <unk> : so back in college a few years ago my coworker lived in an apartment complex 
 the lady at the front desk was apparently a real piece of work not friendly never cutting anyone any slack extremely unhelpful and <unk> to be polite 
 mind you she was the face of the apartment complex it 's kinda in the job description to be polite even when you 're fucking someone over 
 and she was the only one who worked there 
 let 's call her rachel 
 the apartment would tape a envelope for the rent check and a newsletter '' to the apartment door every month 
 according to my coworker the newsletter never had any actual pertinent information in it recipes resident <unk> upcoming holidays etc 
 waste of paper literally never anything important so he would just throw it out without reading it 
 -- -- there were three big things that pissed him off while living there but he <unk> me there were many more smaller things that were n't really worth telling me 
 **first strike** : his girlfriend would visit him quite often and there was a free parking garage on the property 
 she would always park there 
 one day she came outside and her car had been towed 
 after visiting the front office they learned that the apartment had included in the newsletter for the month that they had started using parking passes and that you had to come to the office to pick one up 
 when he asked why they did n't tape it to the door inside the rent envelopes for the month rachel looked at him like he was crazy 
 she did not offer to help with the towing cost and he tried asking 
 nope 
 $ 200 bucks 
 <unk> : he says that in all past cases when it was actually an important update they would post an independent flier with large font on everyone 's door 
 except for the parking pass case for some reason 
 <unk> strike** : after ten months of paying rent on time he was one day late 
 $ 50 late charge 
 yes it was his fault but a lot of places will let it go if you 've been good in the past 
 when he went in to ask for some leniency she shut him down real quick 
 <unk> strike** : over new years the hot water in the entire complex was out for nine days 
 when he went to the front office to ask for an <unk> if they were offering any sort of rebate for the inconvenience rachel said not only no but hell no 
 -- -- so at this point apparently he was fed up 
 he took one of the <unk> scanned it in to his computer to get the logo and the <unk> and wrote a letter to all of the residents saying they were offering a rebate at the front office for the hot water being out for so long making sure to <unk> the voice and professionalism of the complex 's writing and to be at the office the next day between 8 am and 10 am to pick up a check 
 printed out 70 copies recruited a friend and went out at 3 am with <unk> on 
 they quickly posted them on all of the doors 
 i 'm sure rachel 's life was hell the next day turning down confused and angry residents in a flurry for two hours 
 she even posted a facebook update on the apartment complex 's wall saying that she had the police investigating the fraud '' and dusting for <unk> this is a fairly large college town they have better things to be doing 
 i do n't think i need to tell you this but he was never caught 
 p.s 
 he said that right as he was about to move out rachel got fired and two polite and friendly girls manned the front office from then on 
 -- -- **tl dr** coworker has many bad interactions with apartment receptionist then <unk> her life by writing and posting a fake apartment announcement saying all residents were getting a <unk> give you some background i 'm 26 years old 
 i 've been taking care of my family my whole life while they really never gave anything back in return 
 especially the last 8 years 
 when i turned 18/19 years old my grandparents and my dad passed away 
 all the expectations were put on me to go get a job take care of my grandparents then their place once they passed away until we could sell it 
 and basically handle all the <unk> and responsibilities while my mom <unk> my younger brother 23 now and they sat around watching tv all day cause they could n't handle it '' 
 even up until recently whenever they needed money for something or a bill or whatever i 'd be the one to go get a job a second job sell some of my shit while they did nothing except say <unk> '' 
 anyways fast forward to today 
 i 'm still living at home taking care of my mom and brother 
 my mom finally got a part time job only because she pissed away all her inheritance money and has been working for awhile 
 about a month ago my brother gets a job 
 yay good for him 
 he tells me he 's planning to move out with his girlfriend in about <unk> months cause he wants to get out on his own 
 i have no problem with that so long as we all have plan 
 the bills being split 3 ways is fine but if one of us leaves it 's gon na mess everything up for the other two people unless we have something set up 
 a week later he moves out 
 then he denies ever saying any of that 
 gets pissed at me because even though i 'm happy for him it sucks cause he 's kind of fucking things up for us 
 he calls me an asshole tells me to fuck off and cuts me out of his life since i do n't do shit '' even though i 've been taking care of both their asses the last 8 years while he sits in his room all day eating <unk> and playing <unk> 
 he also takes his mom 's car because for some dumb reason she put the car in his name paid it off and is keeping him on her insurance even though she does n't have a car and has to walk to work now 
 she does n't even get mad or try to talk to him she let 's him do whatever cause apparently he 's the good kid or whatever 
 so now we 're in a bit of a crisis because we 've got to figure out to cover his 1/3rd of everything 
 at this point i should also mention our bills are way higher than they should be because during one of the times i was living on my own my mom apparently forgot '' to pay some of her bills for like 8 months 
 which i should also mention during the times i lived on my own i was always paid for my costs plus gave her money to help with her own bills and then she would still try to mooch extra money out of me by bullshitting me about some bill or whatever and then giving that money to my brother or buying cigarettes 
 anyways back to the present 
 i 'm now scrambling for a second job 
 i stay up about 3 days straight with barely 2-3 hours of sleep per night applying for jobs <unk> person going to interviews etc etc 
 what 's my mom doing 
 watching tv and smoking <unk> 
 i get on her ass to do something and she gives me the same answer she 's given me the last 8 years : she 'll sell something or borrow money from a neighbor 
 which never happens 
 at this point i should also mention she 's kind of a hoarder and has all my grandparents and my dads shit in the garage and backyard 
 apparently she ca n't sell the stuff yet which she 's been saying since 2005 because she needs a digital camera 
 even though both my girlfriend and i have explained to her hundreds of times that we have cameras on our phones there 's ebay apps 
 it takes two fucking seconds but regardless most of that stuff is shit anyways save for a few personal items and some jewelry 
 and she should just get off her ass and get another damn job 
 so i 'm driving to work last night and i 'm fuming 
 but i 'm looking at everything objectively 
 <unk> we 're behind on rent which again my mom does n't care about 
 oh our landlord 's nice she does n't mind '' 
 oh there was problems with this place before we moved in so it 's okay if we 're little short '' 
 our rent is due on the 1st 
 we got an extension to the 5th 
 then the 8th 
 then the 15th 
 my mom 's planning to pay this month on the <unk> 
 every month i 've always had my share plus more covered 
 it 's always on her or my brother 's end that the money is n't there 
 so i 'm looking at this and i 'm like : there 's no fucking way i can do this 
 even if i get this month what about next month 
 and the month after that '' 
 i mean yeah i already work 7 days a week i could get a 3rd 4th 5th job but then i would n't have time to go emt school 
 i 'd be making just enough to cover everything but i would n't have any extra money to get myself out and into something better 
 and it 's at this point i say fuck it '' 
 i 'm not paying a single penny more 
 i 've got several offers from friends to move in with them for 1/3rd of what i 'm paying now no cost for utilities or anything else 
 i 'm good to go 
 i 'm taking my money and gtfo 
 but i 'm not a complete asshole not just yet anyways 
 this is still going to benefit my mom as well because if she 's not paying anything either she can save up her money 
 she 's probably got <unk> days to gtfo and even then she could milk that by squatting or whatever 
 that 's thousands of dollars to get another place get a cheap car whatever get her shit together 
 she 's never really had to figure things out on her own because me or someone else would always fix '' everything 
 here 's where my revenge comes in : i 'm not on the lease 
 years ago when i was living on my own my mom wanted me to <unk> on a lease with her 
 and she swore up and down that it would n't affect anything and that she 'd handle everything but i did n't buy it 
 my brother however did 
 so i 'm not liable for anything 
 i 'm leaving and they can have fun dealing with clearing out all of mom 's shit 
 oh and they 're also required to have a professional cleaner come in and clean before they leave as well 
 which could be a bit <unk> considering my mom has a few cats that she lets do whatever they want and does n't care 
 they piss on something or tear on the carpet and oh well the fence was kind of messed up when we got here 
 i do n't think the landlord will care 
 there are <unk> and tear laws too so i do n't think she <unk> it to be immaculate or anything '' 
 and i 'd offer to help buy getting a u-haul truck to get all their shit out or help pay for a professional cleaning but i 'm not on the lease 
 oh and my brother just told me to fuck off '' and cut me out of his life a week ago while my mom just sits around not doing anything to fix the situation like she always does 
 so now they can both fuck off '' and deal with it '' 
 tl dr : lazy mom and <unk> younger brother treat me like shit and only need me when they need money 
 brother moves out tells to me <unk> and mom puts all the shit on me 
 i have enough and leave and their left to deal with everything since their name is on the lease and not me 
 long story short my asshole sister ruined the <unk> prince <unk> in the harry potter series 
 at the time she was obsessed with twilight and was reaching the end of the last book 
 she was 16 i was 13 and i was house sitting until she got home roughly an hour from when i devise my plan 
 here 's the plan which i started : she kept the last twilight book in her room on her shelf 
 i ripped out all of the necessary pages to read the big finish 
 i then disconnected out internet from our router she could n't figure out the power button on my xbox i had nothing to worry about 
 she gets home leaves her purse in the kitchen and goes to her room 
 she forgets her cellphone in her purse i take it and hide it to be given back anonymously later that way she ca n't call anyone for an extra book she ca n't drive she got home on her school bus no permit 
 best part of all she ca n't leave the house without my parents permission which she ca n't get because i have hidden her and all the other phones in the house no safety hazard i knew where they were and were easily accessible if you knew where they were 
 now comes the fun part : she 's mad because she finished all of the rest of the book and finds her last necessary pages ripped out 
 she 's searching the house first for her pages then her <unk> phone and ca n't find either 
 she 's trapped in our house without her final pages or any way to get a borrowed copy 
 our parents finally get home from their jobs and as they are opening the garage door i run past my sister 's room and yell in her door the spoiler ending to the last twilight book which she never read 
 she immediately goes to our parents and tells them everything i supposedly did giving me time to cleanly and <unk> tape the pages back together put her cellphone in her purse she is standing at their car telling them everything keeping them in their car replace the home phones and get in my room to act like i 've been staring at my video games ever since i got home 
 there is this manager paul who is very <unk> when it comes to me helping him 
 he is n't helpful when it comes to asking him questions about his problem 
 he wants me to just do my job and fix it without any input from him 
 one day he called me to come over and fix something for someone else 
 when he hung up it did n't hang up right and the line was still open 
 i listened and the other guy was saying it was n't a big enough deal for me to have to come over but paul insisted saying he likes making me work for my pay because i do n't do anything 
 after that i 'd keep hearing from my co-worker terry stuff like dude paul really does n't like you '' 
 paul started only dealing with terry and generally complaining about me to others 
 so after figuring out how and doing lots of testing on my computer i remotely connected to his computer and set the screen saver to turn on after 1 minute of <unk> 
 i also set it to lock the computer when he would move the mouse and make the screen saver turn off so he 'd have to put in his username and password each time to unlock it 
 nothing special there except i set the <unk> on that area of his registry to deny his account access to change the settings 
 in fact i set it to deny his account the ability to view certain parts of the settings 
 his account could view it enough to follow the settings there and turn on the screen saver after 1 minute but enough was denied so when he went to his screen saver settings it showed that no screen saver was set 
 being an inexperienced computer user he <unk> several times trying to fix it 
 as i expected and hoped he only called terry and did so many times throughout the week 
 even better terry was busy and started getting annoyed at him as well and would take a while to get around to him 
 i would remotely connect to his screen and watch the screen saver come on and he would move the mouse and unlock it several times in a short period of time 
 he started moving the mouse all the time 
 he got very very upset 
 he even called our boss and complained 
 when our boss asked me about it i said this was the first time anyone had mentioned it to me but that i knew that paul had called terry several times over the week and thought he was dealing with whatever it was 
 i offered to go fix it but he said he 'd get with terry since he was the one working on it 
 terry would complain to me about paul 's issue and say he could n't figure it out 
 he wanted me to look into it but did n't stress it much 
 i pushed it back on him saying that paul obviously likes him and that he needs to call me if he wants me to fix it 
 i offered several suggestions that seemed like really good ideas to fix it knowing full well that they would n't 
 after a second week of him calling terry he then called me and i let him explain the problem to me 
 i asked a bunch of questions and had him try a bunch of things as he got more frustrated because he had already tried these things 
 he complained that terry only came by a couple times and did n't get it fixed 
 so i went right over there and fixed it quickly and gave some bogus procedure that terry had suggested once and did n't get around to trying yet 
 i then told terry that i fixed it and that his solution was what did it 
 i also <unk> that information to our boss and got a pat on the back for going out of my way and taking on an issue that terry was working on since he was busy with other things 
 paul treated me a lot better afterward and i got some good laughs to myself for 2 weeks <unk> set out the players me david i 'm tony brother 
 tony owns a medical it company lets call them it docs '' 
 well it docs was just starting quite a few years ago when it secured what was to be one of its biggest contracts ever 
 it was a major <unk> for tony and it docs 
 however tony needed some assistance to properly execute on the contract 
 tony approached another company called making this up bsob it '' ran by a mr. liar tony and mr. liar had several meetings in which tony outlined the contract and his plan of action and where he 'd need mr. liar assistance 
 mr. liar listened and verbally committed that bsob it could help and would be more then happy to help but needed more information 
 tony gave mr. liar the information and thought everything was just fine 
 when one day the doctors office called up my brother tony and said they 'd no longer be interested in the contract and had just signed a deal with bsob it 
 tony was pissed he came to me for advice 
 i 'm not sure if this was good advice but the way i saw it is he was just a light weight in the game and got <unk> by a heavy weight 
 if he went after bsob it and mr. liar today it could massively <unk> 
 i told tony he needs to toss this way in the bin and focus on growth not revenge 
 he then said to me you 're right but one day i 'll get them '' tony went on to grow it docs into a thriving company 
 when one day he had become so large he decided the most <unk> way to grow to acquire his competition ... and he set his eyes on bsob it 
 in that time bsob it had lost several key contracts and was quite a bit smaller then it was since the days of the meetings between mr. liar and my brother tony 
 however my brother decided to acquire this company 
 i suspect a lot of it had to do with the <unk> the injustice of yesterday tomorrow type deal 
 now tony was very smart in his approach 
 he put one of his most senior partners to be the face of the acquisition 
 he even went so far as to accidentally remove his picture from the <unk> portion of his companies website 
 he figured that no way would mr. liar remember it docs and would n't suspect a thing 
 well he successfully bought out bsob it and mr. liar was still their ceo 
 however there is no need for two ceos ... now is there 
 tony invited mr. liar to discuss the role that he will play with it docs 
 i guess mr. liar assumed that he 'd retain his position and benefits 
 but there was no need for two ceos 
 so as my brother said mr. liar and him went over how the company would be structured and then tony asked mr. liar where do you see yourself in this organization '' now those meetings lasted for awhile over the course of several days 
 what struck tony is mr. liar never remembered their first encounters and how mr. liar stole his client until ... then in the final meeting something clicked and mr. liar said to my brother did n't we do business together before '' 
 my brother smirked and said yes ... we have '' mr. liar said i ca n't seem to recall do you '' 
 my brother smiled back and said do you remember when in year xxxx a small start up medical it company came to your company for assistance with a mr. x doctors office '' 
 mr. liar is getting uncomfortable in his chair he said yea '' my brother went onto say well we never did much business together because after we discussed being partners that doctors office called me up and said they were no longer doing business with me and have chosen your company over mine even though you did n't even see the opportunity until i asked for your company partnership on the deal '' mr. liar was still ... pretty sure he already knew what was up 
 my brother then said now mr. liar my partners and senior mgt have discussed what role and what <unk> you bring to the table 
 we simply do not see the need for your continued service in our organization and will be ending your employment with us '' with that mr. liar left the company for good 
 and before people <unk> my brother mr. liar really did n't bring anything to the table besides being a business man with questionable ethics and with extremely outdated it <unk> friend of mine told me of a story from when she was a 10 year old 
 she was outside her house playing with her four year old brother on the basketball court 
 three other boys about her age were nearby playing basketball 
 one of them threw the ball without warning <unk> at the little boy 's head in an effort to knock him to the ground 
 her brother being only 4 years old felt the full force of the ball 
 his hands and legs were cut and <unk> 
 he started crying and the older boys howled with laughter 
 my friend had seen the ball hit its target but not who threw it 
 she sent him straight home they lived across the street - he protested thinking that she was taking the other side and feeling all the more miserable but she stood firm and sent him to their house 
 when he was safely in his mother 's arms she <unk> around and demanded who did it '' 
 her quiet but <unk> tone shut the three boys up immediately they were each one to two years her senior 
 again she insisted who did it '' 
 they <unk> and <unk> and denied saying it was an accident 
 she kept pushing 
 finally one boy <unk> to it but it was just an accident i swear 
 yeah 
 right '' 
 minutes later her little brother looked out of the family window to see his big sister <unk> a <unk> bully pounding and pounding his sobbing face - pride completely gone 
 my friend 's dad had to come out and pull her off 
 afterwards he did n't reprimand her at all because she had served up a portion of sweet delicious revenge 
 tl dr : my friend a girl beat the shit out of a larger bully who had it <unk> man i 've been sitting on this story for five years and i have n't told a soul 
 i was living in an efficiency apartment by myself for the first time 
 i was approximately 20 years old and i was working two server job both of which required a clean and <unk> uniform 
 every three days or so i would have to do a load of work clothes and i did n't have much time to do it between jobs 
 the apartment complex that i lived in had 16 apartments in it and we all shared a washer and dryer 
 i had the cycle timed to the minute and i would go to my apartment to watch a tv show or clean or something and would change my clothes from the washer to the dryer without wasting any time 
 i was considerate 
 after i had been living there for three months or so this lady moves in and starts doing her laundry in the washer and dryer but she had the habit of leaving it in for hours sometimes all night 
 i would go to do my laundry see that her clothes were in the washer go back to my apartment and wait for about 30 minutes or so go back and they would still be there 
 i would set an alarm for balls early in the morning to do my laundry before work and <unk> clothes would still be in <unk> 
 after this happened three times or so and my <unk> were pretty dirty i would take her clothes out of the washer and set them on top of the dryer so that i could wash my clothes 
 i did this a few times then she wrote a note that said something along the lines of if you touch my clothes again i will call the police '' or something 
 whatever i wrote a note back saying that she is n't the only one that has to use the laundry 
 she seemed to get the message for a little bit 
 maybe i just was n't doing my laundry at the same time as her 
 but one night i was doing laundry at midnight after i had gotten off of work and my clothes were in the dryer 
 i set an alarm that would go off in 45 minutes which is about how long the dryer in the complex takes 
 before the alarm goes off she shows up at my door with my uniform shirts neatly folded and a shit eating grin on her face and says you left these over there i figured i would fold them and bring them to you '' 
 1. the shirts were n't even dry she pulled them out before they were done 
 2. i was really wanting to get my laundry done fast so i could go to bed 
 i just said thanks '' and slammed the door in her face 
 the next time i went to do my laundry <unk> <unk> hers was in there 
 i did my normal thing of going back to my apartment and waiting for 30 minutes or so then going back over there to check if she had moved her clothes 
 to be fair i did this for three hours 
 after three hours i took a gallon of bleach and poured it all over her clothes in the washer 
 i do n't know what got into me i was just feeling some rage from her writing a nasty note and taking my clothes out of the dryer <unk> them and giving them to me while they were wet 
 the next morning as i was leaving for work i saw her pulling her bleach <unk> clothes out of the dryer 
 for some reason she did n't suspect me because she was fighting with her next door neighbor as well 
 go figure 
 she moved out soon after 
 tldr lady gets mad at me for doing my laundry i poured bleach on her trashy <unk> work in san francisco and take the bart train into the city everyday 
 the trains like any big city get very full during <unk> hours 
 nothing makes me more angry than when someone thinks they are too good for the line 
 they think it is acceptable to just cut infront of everyone and get on the train 
 in the past when i have been cut off i have tried to fart or <unk> on them 
 this comes with the downside of making the entire car smell for just one person 
 not fair if you ask me 
 but today luck was on my side 
 this 20 something girl cut right in front of me 
 she got a seat and seemed very smug about her current situation 
 that was until her stop came 
 she did not <unk> an irate man with a large backpack standing between her and her exit 
 difficult to stand up with fat man and a backpack in your way 
 <unk> 
 she did not make her exit at the time transfer station 
 that should give her about 30 minutes to think about the social etiquette of lines 
 i work for a <unk> we had three companies : * company a think low end * company b medium end * company c high end all in the same industry just at different quality <unk> points 
 each company was different and each company had similar names but where divided 
 now if you worked for company b like i did you could n't sell company a or c products 
 and the same for everyone else 
 pretty much if you worked for the company you knew this but our consumers did n't which was good cause it did n't <unk> customers 
 then one day a bright eye ceo who should of never been a ceo decided he wanted all the company under one name 
 at first we thought this was a great idea 
 this obviously meant we could all sell each other products and offer more choices to our consumers right 
 well ... no the sales people in a b c and could only sell their respective products ... even though all three of them worked for the new company called company d. this pissed a lot of people off 
 ceo said fuck it and went through with it '' so i created numerous fake emails and profiles and began inquiring on different products with sales people i knew could n't sell that product i would then escalate this compliant up to their supervisors supervisor supervisor until i would finally get to the ceo 
 at which point i would proceed to inquire again ... why in the world would he do this 
 keep in mind i had inside knowledge on our structure so climbing the ranks was easier i then cited false advertising and various other laws and told the ceo unless i could work with that particular sales person same from company b on company a product i would sue i did this across maybe 20~ accounts keeping each one fresh i was a busy man and then i pulled out my ace card during this time i had become good drinking buddies with a consumer law lawyer luck of the draw and he wrote up a draft and sent it to my ceo <unk> the potential law suit 
 the policy changed we are still under company d but i now have the rights to sell any product to any consumer under our roof 
 know what the hardest part of this whole ordeal was 
 i was in a meeting with the ceo and he posted 8 or 9 complaints and the lawyer letter and discussed it and explained his reasons for the change in policy 
 i had the biggest shit eating grin on my face cause every single one of the emails we discussed was in fact me 
 after the meeting i asked the ceo so did any of those consumers <unk> to sales '' 
 he goes strangely enough no '' i shook my head and said thats a real shame '' it 's been quite some time since this change occurred no one besides my wife who helped me even knows what i did 
 not only that our company is stronger then ever 
 turns out re <unk> was really smart because we <unk> our marketing resources cleared up customer confusion our sales people can make more money and our consumers have a greater range of selection 
 so ... .i work in a paint and body shop we do a lot of good quality work 
 we have a lot of mercedes and bmw customers since their owners generally want the type of work that we <unk> 
 so does the local <unk> dealership since we generally are better at paint and body than their own shop 
 the owner is a real <unk> though and is always trying to lowball us on work that she <unk> at a higher price through her own dealership 
 that alone pisses me off 
 then she is always at the local <unk> spaces making her presence known in some fashion as a real <unk> of the arts always <unk> about some <unk> or another 
 but she is just there for the <unk> and be seen value more than any real desire to support the arts 
 so the other morning i 'm watching the morning news 
 she comes on in an add for her mercedes dealership talking about the <unk> of the summer and we 've got the deal of the summer ... <unk> commercial started with a shot of a stereo and <unk> thicke 's blurred lines playing ... her idiot <unk> dancing ... <unk> yada yada ... i know how cheap this woman is 
 plus at the moment it really is the song of the summer 
 there is no way in hell that a- it 's been licensed for commercial use yet and b- that this cheap cunt would pay the fee 
 soooo ... i get a video of the commercial on my phone 
 make a phone call to the offices of <unk> records and ask to speak with the law department 
 they connect me with a gentlemen who after a bit of explanation connects me with a nice attorney for mr. thicke 
 i gave him all of the information from the tv station that <unk> the commercial and who should know copyright law inside out to the dealerships <unk> 
 he seemed very appreciative 
 when informed about the video he also asked me send it to him 
 since it 's a lawyer i doubt that i 'll ever hear anything about it <unk> you know but i would like to think she got a not so nice phone call about her theft of copyright 
 tl/dr get woman i do n't like in trouble with lawyers for spite ... i was told to post this to /r/prorevenge in the belief that you guys would enjoy it 
 if it does n't fit my apologies and you can remove it <unk> 
 i just remembered this one while drawing in my sketchbook today 
 apologies for the length 
 when i was in middle-school i believe 7th grade because that was a shit year all around i was constantly bullied by a kid named d. d was just an all around dick 
 he thought he was hot shit because he was athletic and girls thought he was good looking 
 he had the <unk> <unk> dash from the <unk> except not cool 
 and he had the most <unk> <unk> though this was years ago thinking of it makes my blood boil 
 d had it out for me 
 maybe because i was smarter than him maybe because i was <unk> more <unk> than him or maybe it was because i was a nerdy kid that looked like the type who should get bullied 
 i do n't know 
 but he was always on my case 
 he would knock my stuff out of my hands in the halls whisper about me behind my back and constantly make attempts to fight me in order to get me in trouble 
 two events forced my hand 
 the first was when he pushed me into my locker while i was bent over picking up my stuff 
 my glasses snapped 
 i am someone who 's prone to <unk> violence as much as he can but when put into a sudden shocking situation i can get upset quickly 
 that was the case here 
 i turned around and went in swinging with every bit of emotional force i could muster 
 i only got him once in the gut before my math teacher pulled us apart 
 i think she knew what was up because she left me off with a warning 
 d denied doing anything and was believed 
 and i still had to replace my glasses spending money that my family could n't afford to spend 
 i was aware of this and devastated 
 then came the final straw 
 d made fun of my weight in front of everyone in my art class : including the girl i had a crush on 
 that was it 
 it was like a <unk> went through me 
 like a needle snapping from being pushed down too hard for too long 
 i felt like an entirely different person 
 i slowly closed my sketchbook looked straight into d 's eyes with a blank almost serial killer stare and simply said : you 're going to get it '' 
 d gave me a weird stare but thought nothing else of it 
 months passed 
 d slightly kept his distance from me only bothering me now and then probably out of fear i would do something terrible to him 
 this was my plan 
 i waited it out and here 's why : in said art class we have a sketchbook 
 this sketchbook is <unk> of all the work that goes into producing our final projects 
 when we 're done with our sketchbooks we are meant to put them into cubbies in a cabinet 
 the sketchbooks are turned in at the end of the trimester for a final grade 
 i realized waiting outside my drama class which was one room down from the art class that the janitor came to clean out the art class trashcan about five minutes after we we left the classroom 
 perfect 
 i had to time it just right 
 it 's two days before our sketchbook is due 
 we all put our sketchbooks into our cubbies and leave the classroom 
 my art teacher starts to walk down the hall after locking the art room 
 i chase her down before she turns the corner 
 <unk> 
 art '' 
 i say 
 i forgot to put <unk> last <unk> into my sketchbook 
 do you mind if i can get your keys and fix it really quick 
 i 'll turn it in to you right after i 'm done it 'll only take a few minutes '' 
 after contemplating this mrs. a decided to give me the key 
 she had no reason to believe anything <unk> 
 i had been on my best behavior all trimester <unk> for this moment 
 i had only minutes 
 i rushed into the art room 
 then i ripped open d 's <unk> pulled out his sketchbook and stuffed into the trashcan 
 i threw in just enough scratch paper over the book to make it not look suspicious 
 then i dipped out 
 as i left the hallway i checked back to see that the janitor had arrived 
 right on time 
 i <unk> going to mrs. a 's office 
 thanks <unk> '' 
 she says 
 no thank you 
 and can i say this was probably the <unk> art class i 've ever had '' 
 i replied beaming 
 to keep a long story from going any longer d failed the class and had to go to summer school 
 i knew this by watching the chaos from affair <unk> on his conversations 
 he was moved out of my middle-school the next year 
 **tl dr** : kid bullied me and called me fat in front of my crush i executed the perfect <unk> operation and ruined his <unk> making him go to summer school and potentially moving him out of my middle-school as <unk> you can draw a clue from my username but i worked as an assistant manager for a retail store that sells clothing for plus-sized women 
 for the most part i did my job well and the customers loved me 
 i was a poor performer when it came to getting customers to apply for our store card however 
 the store was not in a great neighborhood and it was a recession 
 i did n't push the card and my evaluations always reflected that i was a poor performer 
 the regional manager always made it known that he did n't like me because of this problem i had with getting people to apply 
 our store was also under <unk> for having high loss <unk> 
 the store manager and the other assistant store manager were <unk> 
 they always made their <unk> for credit card applications 
 i later found out they had a pool of social security numbers and names that they constantly <unk> applications with 
 they were cheating the system and basically making me look like crap in the process 
 just before july 4th i got a text message from the store manager asking if i had put a <unk> in the back to save for a later purchase 
 she sent a pic of the top 
 i told her no it was n't mine 
 the store manager then had pics up of her at a 4th of july <unk> wearing the top on facebook 
 the store manager was always super broke 
 she did n't have a car she had too many kids she lived on state assistance 
 when i got to work i decided to see if the transactions showed that she bought the top 
 she did n't 
 i was furious 
 the company always sent loss <unk> to our store to ask us if we were stealing and i hated those interviews 
 i emailed the head loss guy for the company and gave him screen shots of everything : the text messages the facebook pics the inventory screens 
 she was fired 
 i also exposed the social security number scam they were running to meet their <unk> but it turns out they knew about it and were deciding what to do 
 in the end i was made very uncomfortable and i quit 
 it turns out the regional manager was made to look really dumb and he already did n't like <unk> roommate was a girl i met during community college 
 she was so cool 
 totally chill and funny 
 moved in with her and everything changed 
 she would start screaming at me because i turned the ac <unk> august during 90 degree f <unk> though i promised to <unk> fully for it and it turned out to just cost $ <unk> 
 she would also get angry when i woke her cat up 
 she got so crazy hostile i would lock my door at night out of fear of her <unk> me in my sleep 
 so i moved out after that month but i was still obligated to the lease 
 i tried to find her a new roommate that she liked but she made the process difficult 
 i was getting anxious because rent was about to be due and i was not about to pay for two apartments 
 so i stopped giving a fuck and signed a <unk> with a random foreign 40 year-old man i made sure he was fully aware of what he was getting into 
 when i told her she started yelling how i 'm stupid i do n't know anything about the law and she knows a lot more about leasing agreements since she worked at a leasing office 
 the look of quiet <unk> when i laid out everything stated in our leasing agreement and rental laws in our <unk> too satisfying 
 <unk> : a year later i was at an intersection just about to take a right <unk> she was coming the opposite way and sped up real fast to take a left in a dangerous attempt to cut me off 
 i saw this and stopped 
 my mom who never met my <unk> was in the passenger seat and turned to me in utter disbelief wondering what just happened 
 certified crazy 
 sort of satisfying knowing that our battle 's conclusion still got this crazy person 's <unk> <unk> 
 second story : for my senior year i lucked out with rooming with two very good friends of mine 
 this was only because their third roommate squeals had an internship opportunity for that semester so i would have to find <unk> else for the spring which was fine 
 i call her squeals because she does n't talk she squeals in a really soft voice so you ca n't understand a damn thing she 's saying 
 roommates confirmed she adopted this voice to appear cute to guys 
 incoherent as fuck but somehow she gets a lot of guys 
 anyway i was seriously hoping that she would n't be back for spring so i could room with these two awesome girls 
 so i was really excited when squeals was telling everyone she was n't coming back for spring 
 then rather last <unk> was coming back so i had to get an apartment fast 
 i put a hefty deposit on one 
 then she 's not coming <unk> begs me to take her place 
 i do so because the roommates price and location are <unk> i still lose that deposit and i mention it to her 
 she did n't even say sorry or even acknowledge the <unk> of it which was what i know i would do if i were in her shoes 
 she changed her mind three freaking times without thinking about anything 
 i was <unk> and so were my roommates so we started plotting together 
 i never had any kind of written lease agreement with this girl which i knew i could use to my advantage at the end 
 i convinced her i was going to take over for the summer even though i was leaving three months <unk> i told her the day i was moving out and that left squeals responsible for three months rent 
 tl dr : two different girls got into rental agreements with me 
 i made the first one live with a much older stranger 
 the second one had to pay $ <unk> for nobody to live in her room 
 edit : i get that this is n't as extreme or interesting as one would hope for this subreddit but it was n't small enough to go on pettyrevenge 
 edit 2 : i did n't know there would be a couple <unk> <unk> 
 this is because i honestly thought people would be too ashamed to talk about it since i 'm ashamed of my own <unk> sheltered much 
 up until now i thought pettyrevenge was as hardcore as it got 
 love all this though 
 makes my brain jizz 
 the stage is the local <unk> retailer parking lot 
 i’d parked my ford explorer on the side of the store between two <unk> and as such my visibility for backing out of my space was impaired 
 i ease out slowly only to hear a furious horn and a red dodge neon fly by coming from the backside of the store 
 damn lady <unk> me 
 i finish my backing procedure and see her waiting at the end of the row about even with the front of the store 
 she’s right in the middle and i have enough room to get around her on the right and turn right to exit the lot 
 i do so and as i’m pulling away i see her in my rearview mirror <unk> it hard coming after me 
 oh so you want to discuss this further do you 
 i hit the brakes kinda hard and you can guess the predictable outcome 
 keep in mind this is a truck 
 i tow a small camper 
 it’s got a class iii receiver hitch 
 these do not give 
 at all 
 i hop out and see that she has <unk> the nose of her pretty little red car on my hitch 
 there is <unk> 
 there is transmission fluid 
 there are words many of them foul from both her and her passenger boyfriend 
 i smile as the language pours forth until she gets to the part where she <unk> that her father is on the police force and i 'm going to be sorry 
 at that point i inform her that in the case of a <unk> collision the <unk> vehicle is almost always cited for failure to maintain a safe following distance and her father should be able to explain that to her 
 police are called and some random <unk> shows up 
 statements are taken but no <unk> are issued as it’s private property 
 i see her and her friend pull away <unk> fluids and as a last measure of justice i see her car doesn’t even have a permanent tag yet just a paper dealership plate 
 i pop back into the store to buy a new trailer plug connector 
 <unk> me start by saying that i went to a mexican high school 
 one of the bad ones 
 it was a technical school so i chose a course about computers 
 the place was such a mess it was either that or a <unk> course so it was n't much of a choice 
 anyway my class was divided by nerds and idiots but like <unk> <unk> idiot bullies 
 it was a pretty tense class especially since i was very much a nerd 
 on the bus ride home one day i had an argument with my girlfriend so we ended up not talking to each other 
 i noticed one guy from our class was staring at us 
 he was one of the more annoying bullies and most of my friends had already had to trade blows with him before so i just <unk> at him and forgot about him 
 i soon got to my stop and left the bus without saying goodbye to my girlfriend 
 later my girlfriend sends me an im telling me that she does n't want me to get angry or get in trouble 
 i ask her what happened 
 she <unk> tells me the guy sat with her the moment i left asked her if she would n't rather have him as her man and since she was too scared and shy to tell him anything else than to go away she began groping her leg for a while until the bus reached her stop and she left 
 i 'm pretty pissed at this point 
 the next day i see the guy at school but i do n't say a word to him 
 fights were pretty common at that place but i at least wanted to do it outside after school so all i can do is <unk> at him all day and wait 
 i almost made it 
 five minutes left to leave school and he apparently snaps 
 he could n't take me staring <unk> at him all day long and got up right to my face talked trash and shoved me 
 now i know that a shove in that context means either a fight or <unk> out and i was n't going to pussy out 
 i might be a nerd but i 'm pretty tall and thick so his shove does n't even budge me and i punch him right in the face 
 i aimed for his nose but he managed to crouch at the last second 
 i still hit him right on the forehead and he lands right on his ass 
 i 'm about to kick him in the face but one of my friends stops me 
 she 's begging me to stop and i realize the teacher 's still in the classroom 
 i take my stuff and leave with my girlfriend 
 pretty much the entire class <unk> me 
 somebody even told me i did something everybody had wanted to do since for a while now 
 i hear the asshole behind me shouting that my girlfriend is a liar 
 i turn around just in time to see my teacher drag him by the arm to the principal 's office 
 the little dick tries to explain that i punched him for no reason and my teacher tells him to shut up and that she 's fed up with him 
 a couple of weeks later he drops out of school 
 some months later i read in the newspaper that he and his buddies were arrested for driving under the influence carrying loaded weapons and trying to bribe the cops that arrested them 
 turns out they were trying to threaten a wealthy ranch owner or something 
 good riddance i say 
 this was a couple of years back <unk> i still occasionally see him in the street 
 i look directly at him every time not once has he been able to look back 
 sorry for this being a bit long 
 dreams do come true i suppose is the lesson learnt by <unk> : i speak french so excuse my poor english 
 <unk> down to where the fun starts '' to skip the <unk> fight 
 i had this really close friend let 's call her bsb <unk> bitch who was talking so much shit behind my back without me ever knowing 
 i always had doubts that something was fishy but i was not able to prove it 
 one day a random guy who was a closer friend to me sent me all the text bsb sent him 
 she was saying stuff like i was just a trash not good enough to be friend with her she was 22 and that i was fired 
 bsb said all these things without ever telling me that there was a problem between us so i had no idea what was going on 
 i confronted bsb by showing her the messages 
 maybe i was a fool but i was expecting explanations or apologies 
 it got bad 
 instead of taking the blame bsb said my life was over because there was rumours that a guy leaked nudes of me 
 all this was my fault and i should move out of town dye my hair because i was just a whore here 
 i replied saying i would have told her and <unk> her if something like that happened to her 
 i ended the friendship there 
 they have a family business and i used to help them with some work they could n't do themselves 
 i was pretty much the only person in the area to do my job so they were not in a good situation 
 her mother called me a few times saying she needed some help but i was not changing my mind it was a no for me 
 i waited for a year 
 i waited for apologies but they never came 
 out of the blue bsb sent me a facebook link about soap making <unk> i like <unk> like nothing happened between us 
 maybe it was to remember herself that she never did anything wrong 
 i lost my shit there 
 **this is where the fun <unk> revenge is a best dish served cold 
 i used to help them with their family business for the past 8 years 
 i knew details of how the business worked and i knew pretty much everything on how they hid money from the irs 
 i called the irs and told them everything 
 i told them how they hid the money and where they could get all the proof of their real sales 
 their real sale is around 30 000 $ a month and they probably declare half of that 
 when someone was paying them cash they would <unk> the invoice giving two invoices with the same number to different clients 
 the catch is each item they sold had to be inspected by a professional 
 that professional also had to add a piece to the item before it was sent to the client 
 the irs only has to ask for the invoices at that professional and they have all the proof of bsb 's real sale 
 they were also shipping every item under their care and the buyer had to pay a 100 $ fee cash to the <unk> 
 there is even the details of it on their website 
 what a bunch of <unk> i was about <unk> old at the time 
 i was in the raf cadets through school and lucky enough to get on the glider training course 
 this basically involves being on an raf base for a week while being taught how to fly a glider 
 awesome 
 there were about 5 of us on the course and one older <unk> probably <unk> he was a warrant officer but not a real one just in the cadets like us 
 however the actual officers had put him in charge and he was on a more advanced course than us 
 this made him think he was the man 
 none of us knew each other beforehand but the 5 of us quickly became friends and the dickhead was an <unk> from day 1. it did n't seem to bother him as he fucking hated us and did n't want to talk to us anyway 
 fair enough however he started trying to impose all sorts of rules on <unk> example we had to attend breakfast in uniform 
 well that was bullshit because we did n't wear uniform during the day - just a <unk> under the flying suit 
 and wearing uniform meant we had to march around the base rather than walk and salute <unk> off 
 he also tried to impose <unk> and other dumb rules 
 initially we just told him we were n't going to do anything he said but the snitch told the actual officers and then we had <unk> 
 well nobody likes <unk> 
 so heres what we did 
 while he was out we took some wood from the forest and <unk> it into <unk> 
 we then hammered it into place such that the window in his room could not be opened at all from inside 
 when he came back we very quietly tied some rope to his door handle and then to another door handle so that he could n't open his door from inside his room 
 we then got a sheet of paper and lit it on fire to create a load of smoke and then put it out - we did n't want an actual fire 
 then we hit the smoke alarm 
 the dickhead literally shat himself when he realised he was trapped in his room and heard the rest of us shouting get out etc '' 
 he started shouting at first and then it turned to screaming 
 he was pounding and pounding on the door 
 eventually we let him out - we had to because we had to call the front gate security and tell them it was a false alarm - and make sure everything was ok if they came to check it out 
 anyway this fat fuck had tears streaming down his face and just ran off saying he was going to get us fucked up 
 it was great because there were no repercussions for us and he never spoke to any of us and therefore never tried to bully us again 
 moral of the story : do n't be a fat cunt i work for a privately owned fairly large sales company with $ 500 million a year in sales 
 our business model relies on a talented sales force to bring in the revenue 
 our <unk> very early on in his days brought on a young man who went on to become our ceo for over 30 years 
 this ceo was responsible for our massive growth and <unk> with other players in the same field 
 he made this company great and his <unk> was this the sales force always comes first '' he understood that in this business environment that was very competitive the only way to succeed was with a properly well trained sales force 
 because of him we have the best compensation package in the industry 
 in 2006 old age struck him down and in <unk> he passed away surrounded by family and loyal long term co-workers 
 at first the company decided they would simply use the vps to run the company kind of like a <unk> around them 
 they let things go and we did alright 
 however in <unk> we experienced some extreme <unk> due largely to the economy 
 in 2010 it was decided to bring in a ceo to lead the road to recovery 
 when the new ceo came in 2010 he decided the best course of action was cost cutting and <unk> 
 he also decided that the sales force had too many products and cut the sales force in two team 
 one side of the sales force sold product a the other side sold product <unk> although both options are from the same industry they provide different benefits and <unk> and depending on your customer product a might be better or product b might be better 
 this created a lot of tension among the sales team 
 never the less he was the ceo and could do as he please at least he left our compensation package alone 
 just to qualify how frustrating this is imagine you have customer a come in and you’re on team b however customer a is you’re customer and he wants product a. you have to hand over that customer to team a and lose the deal 
 before you could just sell him product a and be happy 
 well it came to our yearly meeting where we celebrate our success and discuss how next year can be better 
 their was a really dirty rumor going around that the commission agreement was going to be cut significantly 
 this did n't sit well among the sales force 
 so the top 20 % of the sales force gathered together by the way the top 20 % produced approximately 70 % of the sales 
 we held the majority of the company revenue and profits in our hands 
 we all agreed prior to the meeting when the new plan was to be unveiled if it would result in a significant cut of more then 8 % we 'd walk out of the room 
 this is a company of 250 people <unk> of which are the sales force 
 the commission plan was unveiled with the new ceo at the top of the stage explaining how this was necessary to protect the company future 
 a 25 % pay cut ... what the hell was this man thinking 
 his <unk> 
 its still above industry average 
 well our costs are below industry average cause we have an excellent sales team who reduces your costs therefore pay us 
 never the less a heated <unk> went on 
 when finally with the ceo not <unk> when one of the best sales person stood up and said to the ceo that a large majority of the sales staff had heard we might be getting a pay cut and had agreed that if we did we 'd walk out the door 
 to which the ceo responded then you will be terminated for insubordination and replaced '' btw the guy who he said this to produced $ 25 million dollar in revenue the year before 
 all of us at the same time got up and walked out of that conference room 
 in total the 37 of us who walked out of that conference room were responsible for $ 350 million dollars of the company revenue 
 the vps were very worried 
 if you think 2009 was bad imagine losing a huge chunk of your most talented sales people 
 very quickly the sales vp pulled me aside and asked me what was going on i explained to him that we hated what this ceo has done to this company and we want him out 
 the vp also asked other sales people and the opinion among the staff was the same 
 we were told to take a break and they 'd figure something out 
 2 hours later myself and 2 others were called into a meeting to represent the sale staff 
 it was myself and 2 others along with the vp of marketing sales accounting product mgt a lawyer or two and the family was on the phone 
 we had a an agreement signed by the a large chunk of the sales staff that demanded one of two <unk> 3 % pay increase or ceo resign and the products no longer be divided with the same commission agreement as before however it not be cut 
 needless to say the ceo was unhappy with the agreement and decided to stand firm 
 it was obvious to everyone that ceo was the only one that was going stand firm i guess his ego was blinding him 
 after we refused to budge on our demands to be fair the vp team was n't that <unk> to argue with us we were asked to leave 
 the next morning we were all called into the conference room 
 the vp of sales got up on the stage and basically said as you can see mr. dickhead is n't here anymore ... he decided to pursue a different career path and resign 
 we have since decided to make some changes to our business our products again will be all under one team and the commission agreement will be unchanged '' since then we 've vowed to not have a ceo our <unk> son acts as a silent ceo 
 so just because your the ceo and your the boss does n't mean you can do anything you like 
 by the way since 2010 we 've grown significantly even in this challenging environment 
 x-post from petty revenge i worked for a small company that <unk> and sold things found in small retail stores 
 i was the customer service manager and had a few sales reps that worked for me 
 basically we would call stores who carried our products and check to see if they needed to order anything 
 also we would call stores who did n't carry our products tell them about our products send them samples and then get them to order from us 
 i had a small staff of 4 sales representatives 
 this was not an easy job but it paid well 
 now i was good friends with the owner of the company 
 he was never there and i ran things for him 
 i was introduced to him by a former colleague named john 
 john used to run a small investment group at the same office 
 he would take investment sales calls and then get a group of people with money to invest 
 so john was no longer there but he would get sales calls on our main phone line 
 people trying to sell investment opportunities in oil & amp gas or some technology start up 
 all sorts of crazy stuff and the salesmen were top notch professional sales guys 
 in other words aggressive so i would have the calls transferred to me 
 then i would explain that john was n't here anymore and they would stop calling us 
 jessica was one of our better <unk> she was an aggressive but well <unk> woman 
 in fact she was a bit of a firecracker but in a good way 
 so one day jessica gets a call from a deep voiced man asking is john in '' 
 she says he is n't there and is about to ask him to hold for one second so she can transfer the call to me 
 but the guy hangs up on her mid sentence 
 she bitches to me in a no big deal kind of way but basically says can you believe the nerve of some people 
 we move on with our day 
 the next day she answers the main line and a deep voiced man asks is john in '' 
 she says no and he hangs up on her before she can utter another word 
 she tells me in a slightly <unk> manner 
 i tell her if he calls again to tell him that john does n't work here anymore 
 the next day she gets another call from the deep voiced man 
 he asks is john in '' 
 and she says no he does n't work here anymore '' 
 but he hung up as soon as he heard the word no 
 i do n't know if you have any experience with sales but you need to have a good attitude 
 i need jessica to be in good spirits 
 hanging up on someone is one of the rudest things you can do on the planet 
 jessica is fuming 
 this is really getting to her 
 so i think some revenge is necessary 
 i tell jessica that when this guy calls tomorrow and asks if john is in to tell him yes please hold on for one second while i transfer you '' 
 sure enough the guy calls the next day and jessica transfers him to me 
 i put him on speaker phone and tell jessica to come sit in my office in order to listen to the call 
 i close the door 
 i know how to talk the talk when it comes to <unk> 
 i ask him his first and last name 
 his first name was david 
 then the company he works for and then i say our phone lines are having problems 
 i asked him what is your direct phone number in case we get cut off '' 
 so i listen to his sales pitch about investing in real estate development 
 i ask him some good questions 
 signs that i am going to invest like what kind of <unk> can i expect '' 
 and is there a limit on how much one person can invest '' 
 at this point the guy thinks i am the whale that is going to put his kids through college 
 i then begin to share my story 
 what we do here 
 that we are in the business of selling also 
 that i have sales representatives that work for me 
 then i switch my tone completely 
 i was raised by a former marine and i know how to chew someone out 
 so i go all r. <unk> <unk> on his ass 
 i shout are you thick in the head '' 
 david says in a stunned and offended voice excuse me '' 
 i continue are you slow or something '' 
 david no '' 
 me then why have you been calling here everyday and hanging up on my employees while they are mid sentence '' 
 jessica looks at me like i just gave her every xmas present she ever wanted 
 david i have n't been doing that i think there is some kind of misunderstanding '' 
 listen david you have been set up 
 we do n't get many incoming phone calls 
 everyday for the last 4 days you have been calling us at about the same time 
 you have a very distinct voice 
 we have been waiting for you to call today 
 there is no doubt that you have been calling my office and hanging up on the person as soon as they say the word no 
 your calls have been <unk> my peaceful office and we decided to take your sales call today '' 
 david uhh long pause i did n't mean anything by it '' who is running the business over there '' 
 david says in a <unk> voice i am '' 
 am i supposed to believe you are the owner of the company '' 
 david no '' who do you report to '' 
 david finally gives me his boss 's name and phone number 
 he also tells when he comes into the office next and i tell david he should probably confess to his boss before i call him 
 david agrees and apologizes 
 i end the call and jessica says that was the best thing to ever happen '' needless to say we did n't get any more calls from david 
 i never called his boss either 
 i thought our conversation was punishment enough and i am willing to bet david never hung up on anyone again.this is a bit of a long one but i think the payoffs are worth it 
 there are two payoffs - my revenge and karma also steps in with one of its own 
 mine is not a direct <unk> revenge but one final big payback to a major asshole who has it coming 
 i posted in /r/pettyrevenge and it was suggested i move it here 
 many years ago i lived with a real douchebag roomate a <unk> old scumbag steve personified - does n't pay bills but racks them up does n't clean but makes messes you get the idea 
 sorry but some character development is required 
 he 's also really bad with his money - his <unk> goes straight to the <unk> then he 's broke for 13 days til the next payday 
 he spends those 13 days on the computer that he made zero payments on in his bedroom trying to meet women online 
 of course online he can be anyone he wants to be not a pathetic loser so online he does pretty well 
 and in creating his phony life online he uses <unk> of people he knows in real life this matters later 
 oh and i need to mention he 's a deadbeat dad 
 has 10 year old twin boys and brags about how he 's never paid a cent in child support 
 ca n't have utilities in his name wo n't file a tax return all to hide from child support 
 owes tens of thousands if not more 
 i tried turning him in for it but faced a wall of bureaucracy and <unk> i could n't <unk> 
 so let 's call him dd for deadbeat dad 
 anyway he meets a young woman from colombia online and over a few months they fall for each other 
 of course she 's falling for a total liar and fraud 
 and she seems to be a genuinely nice girl 
 she thinks she 's meeting a nice guy who wants to start a family some day kids are very important to her 
 dd repeatedly makes clear she 's never to know about his kids or child support issues 
 she really does n't deserve this guy to happen to her 
 they decide it 's time for him to go to colombia so they can finally meet 
 she just wants to meet - of course as far as dd the mooch is concerned he 's going to stay for life and mooch off her apparently her family doing well not wealthy but <unk> 
 so he saves up '' does n't pay any bills enough to go and by enough to go i mean just enough for the plane ticket - and literally not another dime in the world 
 he 's all in on this trip 
 now this was around 2000 ... no smartphones no tablets no airport wifi ... the second he leaves the house he 's disconnected til he gets to colombia 
 so the instant his ride pulled out of the driveway i signed into dd 's email and sent her a simple one sentence email - ask me about my kids when i get there '' 
 apparently it went over about exactly as well as i 'd hoped 
 they were over before they left the airport 
 now of course dd has no money and his return flight is n't for a month 
 and her family does n't want him at their house anymore obviously 
 but there 's a saving grace for him - he 'd told her during their <unk> that he 'd studied to teach <unk> and is fully qualified to do so in reality it was his boss at his former job who 'd done it - dd is barely <unk> and could n't teach stink to shit ... well her dad is apparently a <unk> in colombia 's department of education their equivalent and a very nice guy and had found dd a job he could have once he arrived as a surprise 
 now he only offers the job to save face himself at work and to get dd to earn money to go home get his own place basically get out of their lives 
 all he has to do is provide proof of his <unk> 
 of which he has none whatsoever 
 tl dr - scumbag steve flies halfway around the world to get told off and lose everything 
 story <unk> some obscenities <unk> at one point a couple of years ago i worked for a calling center 
 basically that 's what it was literally 
 people would receive different letters from different clients of ours and call in to schedule an appointment if they were interested 
 pretty harmless stuff at least i was n't calling people out of the blue and <unk> them 
 so one day a couple of months into the job i received a call 
 i started out with the normal thank you for calling am i speaking with said his name 
 all of the letters sent out obviously had name and address on them so saying their name made it a bit more personal and less robotic he confirmed that yes i was and spent the next 45 seconds calling me every name in the book 
 he told me he was sick of getting the letters that i was a cunt and that i was a slut and a whore and if i lived any closer to your office i would come over and beat your brains in with a fucking baseball bat <unk> '' when i could finally get a word in edgewise i told him we would be more than happy to put him on the do not call list and to have a nice day 
 right before i was able to hang up he yelled do n't you fucking hang up on me cunt i will find you and kill you '' okay first of all i was working from home 4 states away from the return address he had received so i was n't too worried about that 
 it just pissed me off that he made the choice to pick up the phone and call the # from a letter that he obviously was n't interested in 
 he could have just thrown it away 
 so later that day when things slowed down a bit i did a google on his name it 's a pretty rare name and found out 2 things 
 1 he has a facebook with 2 friends 1 of them being his mother the other being his brother and loves playing <unk> 
 2 he is a fucking neo-nazi who makes comments on some pretty extreme websites 
 this includes but is not limited to threats against the dirty <unk> who live across the street to him he wanted to rape them until they bled so they knew what real pain was threats against <unk> <unk> threats against the president 
 now i am not saying this happened but the fbi may or <unk> not have received an <unk> with this guys name phone # and address along with copies of his threats to the commander in chief 
 i mean maybe that happened 
 who knows 
 : be careful who you are a dick too i guess is the moral of the story 
 or just do n't be a dick 
 even better this happened years ago 
 there was a spike of petty vandalism going on along my road 
 i live in the rural bit of town and after <unk> at night it 's abandoned and easy to <unk> from which made it an ideal target 
 mostly it was teenagers going down the road and hitting mailboxes with a baseball bat 
 every week 
 my neighbor decided he was sick of it 
 under the <unk> of <unk> the post he installed a metal pole between his mailbox and his <unk> 
 it was hard to see during the day much less <unk> at night while doing 60 down a country road 
 it was also planted well into the ground with a little concrete for good measure 
 he said he saw it happen from his porch one night 
 the car was <unk> down the road and mailboxes were flying off whenever it passed them 
 then the car got to his and there was a scream as it kept driving 
 the next day you could see the ruined mailboxes up until his 
 at his there were two <unk> of a wooden baseball bat 
 he said he actually felt kind of bad for the idiot as he thought they would be cruising down the road and it would just give them a <unk> but the kind of people who go down the road smashing mailboxes are not the kind to drive slow with your friend hanging out the window swinging a bat that would require intelligence 
 god knows what it did to that asshole 's <unk> was the tech support lead working on a government program supporting <unk> engineers 
 very smart people 
 most had doctor or masters degrees in their particular field 
 all in all nice people but a few had zero people skills and were a pain to deal with 
 anyways one of my workers we 'll call him ben had this beat down look on his face after getting off a call 
 ben was a super nice kid 
 always had a smile on his face so i knew something was up 
 he said he just got off the phone with the grump '' not this real name of course 
 apparently the grump had forgotten his password twice already and called back cussing poor ben out about the password complexity requirements 
 nothing too crazy 
 password had to be 14 in length with at least one upper/lower case letter and one special character 
 ben said the grump hung up on him and did n't think he figured out a new password yet 
 told my team i 'd take his call next time 
 me : <unk> how can i help you 
 grump : <unk> # <unk> you @ <unk> 
 i ca n't get this # $ % @ & amp 
 new password to work and i 've tried 50 $ % & amp @ # $ % $ times 
 me : i 'm sorry to hear about that 
 lets try a different password together 
 it needs to be 14 in length with at least one upper/lower case letter and one special character 
 maybe like <unk> '' 
 grump : how about <unk> '' no special character was used me : well the length is right but you were yelling so it sounded like all up case letters and i did n't hear any special character 
 grump : @ # $ # $ % @ @ # $ % @ # $ % get you 're & amp % @ # $ % i 'm not dealing with this # @ $ % @ # $ @ # $ 
 @ # $ f*ck you 
 click after he hung up i looked over at ben and saw a smile jump across his face as i told him to <unk> grump 's account 
 i sent an email to management letting them know what happened and firmly stating my staff will not be treated this way 
 an hour later i got a call from my lead apologizing about the grump 
 hr had spoken to him 
 then said i needed to <unk> his account and create a new password for him 
 i personally delivered the new password to mr. grump which by the way is about 5 foot nothing and maybe 100 pounds 
 he did n't speak a word to me as i dropped the note card off 
 the note card read : remember passwords need to be 14 characters in length or longer with at least one upper and one lower case letter and one special character your new password is <unk> '' this story is from a female friend i had in college and took place almost 30 years ago now 
 she had an apartment that had a school basketball court right behind it 
 one afternoon she was studying for exams and these dickhead teens in a fancy car showed up parked with the sunroof and doors open and began to shoot some hoops while blasting some shitty music loud enough to rattle her windows 
 she tried to do the right thing at first ... she went out and kindly asked them to turn it down a bit 
 they responded with a long stream of abuse such as fuck you cunt 
 stupid whore '' 
 etc and laughed about it 
 they did not turn down the music 
 this loud music went on for about another 40 minutes 
 at one point she looked out the window and observed that they had left the car there with the doors open music still blasting but had moved <unk> the way across the field which was about the length of a football field 
 so she grabbed a bucket and filled it with an entire gallon bottle of liquid bleach took it outside and poured it all over the interior of the car 
 all over the seats and the floor and the dash 
 they did not even come back to the car for another 20 minutes or so leaving the bleach more time to do it 's magic 
 she knew they came back when the music stopped and she heard them yelling what the fuck 
 shit '' 
 and a stream of other such stuff 
 they were super angry and were looking all around 
 they may have suspected her but they had no idea where she came from and they did not see her now 
 she told me they got in an drove away which means they had to sit in it too hopefully <unk> their clothes and maybe even burning them 
 i do n't know the girl <unk> because she was evil and i was afraid of her myself but i always think of that story whenever someone pisses me off with a parked <unk> dad used to be an extremely fit guy back in the day i.e 
 before he had teenage sons and has gained a lot of weight and with it came <unk> 
 after being in denial for a year he came to terms with it and started eating right again and bringing his lunch to work instead of hitting the grill for a quick burger and fries to and started <unk> again to help lose weight 
 after a while he noticed his meals going missing out of the fridge at work and he started asking around to his co-workers and most of then pointed out ralph '' was eating whatever container my dad described his food being in 
 he approached ralph '' about it and ralph quickly fessed up and said it would n't happen again but he continued anyway 
 after a while my dad got aggravated not because he would have to find a replacement for his meal but because this guy would blatantly eat the food in front of people not giving two cares who saw 
 so my dad hatched a plan 
 he decided to make ex-lax brownies and bring a plate to work with him 
 now most of his co-workers hated ralph '' because he 's already eaten their food and ended up in on the joke 
 so they knew to steer clear 
 my dad walks in with his lunch '' and sees ralph chilling out 
 he tells ralph to stay away from his lunch and not to eat it and ralph agrees to do it 
 needless to say food went missing and ralph ran between his office and the bathroom so many times he ended up shitting himself 
 after cleaning up as much as he could ralph went to the boss and ratted my dad out saying he was poisoned by him 
 my dad gets called in is asked about his food '' and told the boss that he told ralph to stay away from the food 
 boss looks at ralph and asks if this is true ralph says that 's not the point '' 
 boss responds with sending him home because he smelled like shit and ended up <unk> him to another branch a week later 
 tl dr my dad got tired of his asshole coworker eating his lunch that he slipped ex lax brownies as revenge i just found this thread and reading some of these inspired to jot down my own 
 for the revenge itself just skip down below so i 've always had a ... rough relationship with my father 
 he 's a good man a good provider and truly and deeply cares for me and my <unk> 
 i do n't want my story to suggest otherwise i love my father very much and have always treated him with respect and learned to deal with his nature 
 <unk> <unk> that said he can be a <unk> son of a bitch an <unk> <unk> at home and short temper when confronted in anyway 
 by way of example when i went far far away to college my first trip back home i decide to be nice and buy gifts for my immediate family 
 i get home give everyone their gift 
 i bought my dad a great $ 60 <unk> he 's really hard to shop for 
 after the gifts are handed out he takes me aside and goes never get me another gift with my own money he was paying for my school at the time if i want something i 'll buy it - i do n't need you to do it '' 
 after i graduated college i got a job in the legal field within a week of graduation 
 at the time i was living at home 
 after 3 months my work was <unk> up like crazy 
 that month i <unk> about 120 hours a week at work 
 i did n't have a day off the entire month including weekends 
 so after 5 weeks of this kind of schedule there 's a brief <unk> and i get 1 day off saturday 
 this was completely unexpected and because of this my mother was not at home that day 
 in light of my dad 's temper she had a personal rule to never to allow <unk> edit : my dad and i to be home together without supervision - a wise rule 
 well that day it was just the two of us and my two kid sisters 
 long story short he throws me out of the house that night and in 12 hours everything i own is in the back of my car as i report back to work another 120 hours that week 
 **revenge** i got my own apartment and life moved on 
 fast forward two years later 
 we as a family have a big anniversary - 25 years since we moved to america we 're first generation immigrants 
 leading up to the event i learned from my grandparents that they actually brought all of my dad 's vinyl records from when he was a teenager with them to america 
 the kicker was my dad either forgot or did n't know this at all 
 so i get a great gift idea 
 i bought a vinyl to mp3 <unk> and went through and <unk> the exact <unk> of my dads teenage years as a gift for him 
 so come the big day our 25 years in america 
 i take my dad aside and tell him i have a gift for him if he wants it 
 his response was along the lines of eh fuck that '' 
 i look him the eye and say in our native tongue no gift no problem '' and throw the thumb drive in the trash and walk away 
 turns out my grandfather told my dad the next day what the gift was and my dad actually cried something i 've never seen 
 i would never wish my father ill but i have no problem saying no gift no problem 
 a few years ago i entered some of my photographs in the amateur section of the county fair 
 while looking through my competition i notice one is submitted by a professional photographer from the area 
 just to make sure it was who i thought it was i stuck around at the end and watched them pick their photo up 
 at the time i was working at the local college as an event manager 
 i ran <unk> various smaller events <unk> and helped plan graduation 
 this same professional photograph asked for permission to photograph our larger rock concert 
 i denied it 
 the photographer submitted a quote to photograph the fund <unk> i denied it 
 finally it comes to graduation 
 as graduation approaches i receive another quote from the photog along with several others wanting the job 
 the session fee from the offending photographer is reasonable and the package deals that would be offered to the students for purchase were competitive with the other offers but i denied it 
 this photographer lost out on about $ 800 of session fees the chance to sell prints to 400 students for an hour shoot and a nice portfolio building opportunity 
 all they got was a $ 40 prize from the county fair 
 edit : the photog in question was operating out of their own studio and had been advertising as a professional photographer for a few years minimum from what records i ran across 
 <unk> first post on reddit 
 i work for a direct lending company in loan <unk> 
 this job is almost 100 % commission and getting paid relies heavily on me guiding potential borrowers through the application process and babysitting their app through the <unk> stage 
 the money can be great the only <unk> is long hours and a lot of time wasted on absolute shit leads 
 the leads come from online sources and are <unk> out through our jr. sales basically low level low skill selling who 's primary job function is to transfer interested parties to us licensed officers 
 this can lead to what could be considered a minor conflict of interest 
 the jr. 's goal is to have as many transfers as possible ... resulting in low quality transfers people who were either tricked or not that serious and only want market rates and to say bye 
 needless to say some of the jr.s send over some junk ass leads on a constant basis 
 i 'm talking mainly about using deception or <unk> to trick borrowers into speaking with me 
 this wastes my time and leads to many unpleasant and pointless conversations 
 time is money 
 after several attempts to <unk> this through their dept 
 managers i decided to get even 
 this is my paycheck you 're starting to really fuck with here 
 i found out their personal phone numbers using my company directory and sent some <unk> to our lending partners stating they wanted information on refinancing 
 by <unk> i mean 'a lot 
 and by 'a lot i mean every single partner i 've ever dealt with in the past 
 for any reference on how annoying this can turn out to be go on lowermybills.com and enter in your name and phone # 
 within seconds the calls will start 
 and they wo n't stop until you answer every 
 single 
 company that ends up getting your info and asking to have your number taken off the list 
 lowermybills.com is just one of our partners 
 we have seven in total 
 tl dr - coworkers in another department send me shitty leads to <unk> their daily numbers fucking me over so i get them some numbers of their own 
 enjoy changing your phone numbers guys 
 be a little more ethical in the future 
 edit : i just noticed i left out a pretty important part which is the fact that since the leads went through our partners they were sent to our systems leading the jr.s to unwittingly <unk> their own cellphones a couple of times 
 they 're bothering themselves 
 i was a <unk> little kid since young and as far as i could remember this happened when i was about 11. my mum had a friend from china and that friend has a daughter 
 let 's call her d in this case 
 d came to <unk> to study and my mum wanted to help out by letting her to stay in our house while she continue her education 
 she was about 15 at that time if i was n't wrong 
 i remember there was this once she claimed that she has lost one of her accessories and her bottle of <unk> polish to which she made a big fuss out of it 
 being so innocent i offered to find it for her which i did 
 that bitch then went to tell my mother that i was the one that had stolen her items because i found it so fast and despite my cries and my <unk> that i merely helped her to find it my mother refused to believe me 
 and because of her that following night i was canned and sent to bed without dinner and not to mention all the additional punishment i was made to do the following day 
 since then i bore a grudge towards her and i <unk> out a plan 
 she had her own room and whenever she heads out she would lock it up 
 my mother has a pair of spare keys which she had cleverly hidden somewhere in the house 
 so one day i happened to find out where the keys were and i used them to gain access to her room 
 during that day she did n't bring her phone out and she had also left some electrical devices on her desk 
 i stumbled upon a clear nail polish remover on her desk as well and i had this brilliant idea of what it seemed like a revenge 
 i poured the nail polish on all the electrical stuff i could think of including the insides of her phone 
 i then locked her door and put back the keys 
 that following night i heard screams from her room 
 followed by my mum 's shouting of i do n't think it 's my daughter 
 she does n't even have access to your room '' 
 and that following day i found the room vacant 
 my mum then explained to me that d had moved out 
 her room has now been <unk> into my room 
 and 7 years later i still think that it 's the best revenge prank i 've ever had since i was a kid 
 not me but my wife and i were in a chinese restaurant in <unk> and enjoying a nice dinner 
 a few feet away from us is a table with two <unk> high school age girls 
 they had ordered this special meal huge combo of a ton of different <unk> meant for two or more 
 suddenly we hear this yelling and the two girls have booked into the parking lot with the waitress unable to catch up 
 after being pretty upset the waitresses start to clean up the plates and then start laughing 
 as we were regulars they came and told us the story 
 bitch left her brand new iphone 
 i laughed and told her to call the cops 
 she said no i sell the phone it 's worth more '' 
 we all had a good laugh until this fat lady walks in and discretely says i think you found my phone '' as we were walking out 
 the waitress gleefully replied : oh yes we found it 
 i think you accidentally forgot to pay your bill though '' 
 awesome dinner 
 tl dr king <unk> tried to book on a $ 60 dinner and left her $ 400 phone 
 baby <unk> had to roll her ass back and pay the <unk> went to check my email on our shared computer and discovered it was already logged into an account my wife had made to <unk> with her affair partner 
 when i realized who this other person was a lot of things made sense in hindsight about how my wife had been acting the past several months 
 the top email included the hotel room number and time they were set to meet 
 i picked up her elderly and very traditional parents and told them i had a surprise 
 i took them up to the hotel and found the room 
 i pretended to be room service when i knocked and my wife answered in a state of <unk> 
 her parents were really confused and she was extremely embarrassed then immediately angry 
 i said something like have a nice life '' and left 
 from what i heard my wife had to rely on her affair partner to drive her parents home since my wife did n't have her own car at the hotel 
 she <unk> on her parent 's opinion of her 
 she always felt growing up that she never <unk> up to their standards so their approval was very important to her 
 marriage is a big value to them and she got caught <unk> cheating 
 from what i understand she is still very much on bad terms with her father as a result 
 edit : this is not my story 
 i compiled it from comments in another thread 
 <unk> 4 states to copy the text instead of providing a <unk> mod confirmed it 's okay to also provide the link 
 link to the original thread 
 this story starts out back almost ten or twelve years ago 
 i had a pretty good job as a land surveyor made a good living life was good 
 the <unk> i had at the time he had to quit due to health reasons so i got a brand new <unk> 
 all was going ok until he decided to be a complete bitch 
 the job involved covering some pretty rough <unk> lot of <unk> <unk> line in the florida summers <unk> of snakes out 
 great job for me but for this guy it was a reason to <unk> and tell me just how much money he <unk> be getting paid you know the kind 
 well after a particular <unk> of a job we have to set a few property corners and get back to the shop 
 no ... <unk> guy is too good to stay half an hour later to actually finish a job and proceeds to call his fiancee to come pick him up 
 by the time she got there to pick him up i 'd went and set the <unk> by myself 
 it rather pissed me off 
 well the guy being the <unk> asshat he was had given me his <unk> card ... for a window <unk> thing he did out of his garage ... a few weeks earlier 
 he had also been complaining that his neighbors were gay 
 wheels began to turn in my head and i had a nice little <unk> you plan in no time 
 after work i went over to <unk> alabama where the porn shops are and found a nice <unk> mag and asked the cashier for a subscription form for it 
 on the way home i stopped in a circle <unk> and got a money order for one year 's worth of the mag 
 with his address from the card and a nighttime <unk> i got his neighbor 's address 
 i filled it out in his name to his neighbor 's address and mailed it in 
 about a month later he come in to work looking like someone had just kicked his puppy 
 boss asked him what was wrong and even i was not expecting the reply 
 my fiancee called it off 
 she thinks i 'm gay '' 
 my plan worked a bit too well 
 the neighbors got the mags in his name and went over to give them to him but she was the one they gave em to 
 she opened the black plastic and the shit hit the fan 
 i was <unk> the inside of my lips till they bled to keep from laughing because this big <unk> country boy would have killed me if he knew i was the reason the love of his life walked out and left him 
 tl : dr sent gay porn to a coworkers neighbor and caused his fiancee to leave him 
 okay technically this was n't me and more my brother 
 little bit of backstory : i graduated high school almost a year ago and of course was going to need a part time job to cover my needs and whatever i 'll need for college 
 my brother who manages a pizza franchise store and supervises a couple stores owned by his boss told me he can hook me up with a job but at a corporate store of the same company he knew the manager 
 but i wanted to work at a retail instead of a restaurant so i turned his offer down 
 i tried applying to jobs for about 2 months but no place hired me simply because i was 17 at the time 
 with college going to start in a couple of weeks i was desperate and bit the bullet and asked my brother if he can still get me the job 
 long story short i got it 
 i liked working for the store that hired me 
 i would usually cut and roll the dough that they use for the pizzas 
 i loved cutting and rolling dough 
 when i would cut with other crew members we would always tell each other crazy stories and shit and we would always have a great time 
 after 2 months of cutting and rolling i was just as fast as the people who taught me 
 we would always challenge each other and sometime we would also get the manager involved with our <unk> and he would join us 
 but the problem was it was a bit far away 
 it takes around a 15 minute drive to get to the store from my house 
 sounds like a terrible excuse when some people drive up to an hour to get the their job but this is part time people 
 although i enjoyed that store i felt like the drive was n't worth it because there were 3 different other stores that were closer to my house 
 so i talked to my manager and asked for a transfer to the closest store and i got it 
 people were sad i was leaving and i was sad i was leaving 
 it was a great store 
 but on the bright side i only had waste 5 minutes worth of gas instead of 15. this is the part that just made me angry 
 at first the new store i was digging 
 the people seemed nicer 
 i was getting the usual same amount of hours as the last store i came in 3 days a week and work the 3 hours i was scheduled 
 sometimes you would stay more if they needed you and usually they did 
 but i started getting screwed about after a month being there 
 the schedule was being made by the co-managers 
 there 's 2. one is one of the funniest mother fuckers i 've ever met 
 we cut and rolled dough once together and it was fucking hilarious 
 he used things that were n't meant to cut dough to cut dough 
 he got a pizza ring that 's used mainly as a template for <unk> and <unk> pizza sheet outs and went to fucking town 
 he then got the <unk> from the dough mixer then started using that shit as fast as he could 
 he used so a lot of things to cut dough that he really should n't be using to cut dough it was great 
 he even used a fucking lid of a bin 
 but the other co-manager 
 she 's garbage 
 and she was out to get me 
 the good co needed time off for unknown reasons and all the duties of the co-managers was left to the co-manager that hated my guts 
 when we would do dough it was dead silent 
 i could n't <unk> a small conversation no matter how hard i tried 
 the only time i ever talked to her was when i introduced myself 
 and as it turns out she 's the sister-in-law of the manager who hired me 
 she would only talk to one crew member and the managers only 
 assistants co 's and actual manager 
 she is known to send people home early 
 like really early 
 she has sent me home after only 2 hours of working 
 she would send me home right after i finished the dough instead of teaching me or training me in something else 
 if she felt like i was going to take more than 2 hours to finish she would send someone to help me so she can send my ass home right after my 2 hours so i could n't just take my time 
 she was the sole person left in charge of arranging the schedule 
 and apparently her first decision was to only give me 2 days for the entire week 
 i did n't mind because i was scheduled for 4 hours those days meaning i was going to only lose 1 hour of work that week 
 but i remembered who she was 
 i knew i was only going to work for 4 hours the entire week 
 and i did 
 luckily i was only scheduled for 2 days that one week 
 although every week after that i was getting 3 days a week i was still only getting 6 hours work weekly while in the other store i was getting up to 17. so i called my brother asking him what i should do concerning my co-manager problem 
 he just told me to talk to the manager 
 so i did and she had a word with the co. and what does she do 
 she schedules me on tuesday saturday and sunday 
 managers have tuesdays and sundays off 
 tuesdays i can make because i do n't go to school tuesdays and saturdays were the only days me and the manager go in on the same day but i was put in closing crew meaning i would get there an hour after the manager has already left 
 so my complaint only bought me one more hour of work 
 i could n't complain to the manager anymore because i would never see her anymore 
 so i then call up my brother again with the bullshit i 'm going through 
 my brother again suggested the obvious of me going to the store when the manager is there and talk to her again even if i do n't work that day 
 i then told him about her and my old manager being <unk> 
 my old manager knows my brother in case you forgot and my brother showed his love for me in the greatest of ways 
 he calls up the manager who hired me and asks if there 's any co-managers that could use a better pay check and that one of the stores that 's only 2 cities away he supervises needs a co-manager asap 
 apparently my brothers boss pays his employees a bit more than the corporate stores 
 so my old manager talked to his terrible sister-in-law whom i hate btw about the offer 
 and after about 2 weeks of her telling the entire store that she 's thinking about going to the franchise store she agrees and leaves my store and goes to the franchise 
 that 's not it my friends 
 when you transfer from a corporate to a franchise store you basically have to quit the corporate job then get rehired at the franchise 
 so she basically quit her job at my store 
 but it does n't end there apparently my brothers boss was thinking on closing and relocating that store because it was n't earning enough money and she had no idea 
 not even the manager of the franchise store had any idea 
 she was happily working and earning more money for about 3 months until the store owner decided to bite the bullet and <unk> the store 
 where was he relocating the store to 
 detroit michigan 
 we live in california 
 she was offered the chance to keep her job but she would have to relocate <unk> cross the country which she refused and got fired 
 she tried getting her job back at my store and failed 
 i 'm not sure if it was because i spilled a lot of <unk> on how badly she did her job which are a lot btw but this is long enough already 
 or if the manager realized that they can do their the job with just one co-manager 
 she complained to my old manager who complained to my brother and he claimed he did n't know that was gon na happen knowing dawn well it was 
 i 'm not sure what happened to her after that 
 but i 'd like to imagine her getting a shit job or having to start all over again at the bottom 
 i did n't know that any of this was going down until i told my brother that she left the store for another one then he told me 
 i love you brother 
 edit : wording edit 2 : forgot to put the first edit 
 edit 3 : i understand that what i wrote in the description does n't make her seem like she deserves it 
 but i have replied to a comment with more reasons on how bad she <unk> just in case ... a while back i worked at a pretty large tech company with several branches across the country 
 at one point my team had this manager player 
 he was an idiot who did not understand any of the technology we supported 
 he also sucked at managing any issue was immediately passed to his supervisor to handle 
 player 's boss had requested weekly updates 
 his <unk> in our other location would type up <unk> of what his techs were working on projects and the like 
 player got cc : ed on them then directly <unk> them and would present the same weekly report to the <unk> boss 
 i mean <unk> 
 * did he really think this would fly 
 what a <unk> ... player also hired his incompetent friends 
 anyway player had 2 kids by 2 different baby <unk> was n't married to either of them this was over 10 years ago and raised a few eyebrows in a corporate environment 
 we had three females on our team and he situated them in <unk> directly around his cube 
 player surrounded himself with the female techs like a <unk> and would joke about it 
 one of the female techs newbie came over from the customer service department and did not feel very secure in her new position being new and not very technical 
 newbie was young and very attractive 
 she lived with her boyfriend pretty far away so she had a long commute to work 
 player would instant message her frequently saying really smarmy stuff and constantly asking her to stay the night at his place since her commute was so bad 
 newbie felt pressured and told me what was happening showing me the <unk> 
 i advised her to go to hr but she refused to do so she did n't want to rock the boat 
 we had gone through sexual harassment training so i knew that i could complain to hr even if the harassment was happening to someone else but i did not do so at the time as that is n't what newbie wanted 
 i suffered under this moron 's micromanagement for a long time 
 complaints to the big boss went nowhere because in a large company it is sometimes difficult to get rid of a manager 
 one day though player went too far 
 a gal in a different department came back from maternity leave and was showing off her baby pictures to coworkers 
 player made a joke the baby really looks like me huh 
 implying that he was the baby daddy he was not 
 oh boy 
 you bet your ass i complained to hr 
 i mean really it was just a matter of time before someone would sue the company because of his actions 
 shortly after the big boss announced that player 's position had been <unk> 
 several months after that i heard that player had a had time finding a job but was now a store manager in retail quite a step down from his previous position 
 i 'm pretty sure he never worked in tech again as he has no linkedin profile 
 justice is sweet 
 i hope he learned his lesson but jerks like him usually do n't 
 the <unk> ago i worked in the guest services office for a large hotel company 
 we handled everything from basic reservations to i sent my kids into the room first and there was a couple in there already and now i have to explain to my kids what a blow job is '' 
 but that 's a story for another time 
 a little over half of our properties were <unk> which means that in exchange for the prestige of our name and our global booking system you had to operate according to several strict rules ... a whole book of them in fact 
 in our office we enforced the rules and if your franchise did n't meet muster we could refund your guests costs and bill you for it 
 goodbye revenue hello meeting with standards enforcement 
 because our end of the operation was given a lot of power to resolve guest complaints our office 's practices are also written into the franchise agreement 
 therefore we had <unk> classroom training as well as hands on training once the classroom was finished 
 we required that anyone who contacted us received a letter to confirm the resolution of the letter and letter writing was therefore a skill we tested for in the interview process 
 not that it mattered all that much because we had form letters for most <unk> and you could edit them to fit the specifics of a given situation 
 also most of our busy season hires were college kids working a summer job and to make money for school 
 of course every job gets a few rotten apples 
 one of ours was a special case who i will call deeds 
 deeds had a classic case of mine excrement <unk> not have an <unk> '' coupled with the best example of the <unk> effect i have ever seen <unk> in my life 
 because i was a senior representative in the department with proven writing skills i would get to <unk> the letters that the <unk> were sending out 
 if approved they could be sent if not <unk> would be written in purple ink and returned to the employees inbox 
 deeds never got off the <unk> list but it was noticed we was closing out his cases with a letter anyway boy with the added benefit of not <unk> the resolution to the hotel <unk> 
 one of these made its way to the ceo and that is when the shit hit the fan for deeds 
 the letter that had him on the carpet said dear customer its you 're own fault that you did n't understand how hotels work 
 sincerely deeds '' this was sent to one of our loyalty program customers who spent over 300 nights a year in hotels 
 not your everyday stupid on mr. deeds 
 after begging for his job with the department manager and hr manager he was placed on an instant final warning and probation for six months 
 i got the <unk> job of being his mentor 
 i had to sign off on everything he did before he could do it 
 effectively this had me doing two jobs 
 the joys of being a responsible employee am i right 
 eventually he seemed to straighten up and his parole ended 
 immediately he started to fuck things up though 
 at this point he had switched to a night shift so i never saw him but i was kept in the loop on his misdeeds because he was my broken toy for so long 
 almost every day he would bully a night desk clerk into breaking the rules because he did n't want to explain the rules to a whiny customer or he would <unk> decide to refund money for something we did n't cover 
 like a $ 100 check because the poor guest had to wait in long lines at <unk> during halloween or making the front desk pay to order a dozen pizzas because the hotels outdoor pool was closed on christmas 
 those of us on the day shift would get angry calls from general managers and owners and we would have to arrange to get billed for these outrageous expenses 
 needless to say this ate into our <unk> budget for <unk> goodwill payments and management was pissed 
 the department manager stayed late one night read him the riot act and told him he had to stay strictly within guidelines if it was n't in the franchise agreement book and he could n't get the poor <unk> at the hotel to read the required action on page <unk> then he could n't do it 
 last chance next mistake and you 're out buddy 
 deeds realized we all hated him and started looking for <unk> <unk> 
 he thought we were friends because of my six months of hell trying to get him to follow the rules so he came to me for advice on how to interview for a management position at a hotel 
 hotels loved hiring from our office because we knew the rule book inside out and were so <unk> by strange customers that nothing <unk> us 
 i saw an opportunity and have him every to my <unk> brain could devise to get him gone gone gone 
 he shortly got a job at a hotel in florida have his notice and spent his days bragging about how when he was at the hotel he would be calling us suckers all he time to make us do his work for him 
 he was so proud that he was going to get to live on site for up to a year so he could save on rent too 
 he basically stopped doing the job we were paying him for but instead of discipline we all decided it was better to let him slack than make someone else fix his mistakes 
 soon he was gone and an exception was made to give him employee discount cards from our stock so he could stay at a couple of hotels on his drive from <unk> lake city to florida 
 on his first night as a guest at a hotel he tried get the desk clerk to upgrade him to a bridal suite but fucked up two ways 
 first he demanded it instead of politely asking for it and second it was the gm filling in for his night <unk> who was sick 
 the gm called to verify employment and one of the night supervisors have him the run down on mr. deeds then had him hand the phone over to deeds and told him in no uncertain terms to be a good little boy go to his room not bother the staff and check out early 
 the gm was on board with this so the rest of the night was <unk> 
 the next night deeds pulled the exact same shit at the next hotel again the gm was filling in but he was n't as easy going as the first time 
 he called angry as a <unk> sailor fresh from a tour aboard a <unk> who just found out that a vengeful wizard has turned every hooker 's vagina in new york during fleet week into a buzzing <unk> 's <unk> just when young <unk> sonofabitch snaps the <unk> into place on his <unk> flesh <unk> 
 livid i mean our good gm was 
 he demanded deeds be fired for bullying him and his desk clerk and when told he only had the employee discount card so we could get rid of him <unk> he demanded we take action 
 we assured him that the appropriate steps would be taken 
 we will call the night supervisor steve 
 steve left a massive email and supporting faxed statements from both hotels managers for our manager who i will call jamie 
 jamie called both hotels early the next morning having read the email about 3 am when she got up to take some meds for her multiple <unk> 
 she was in the office two hours before we opened so she could call both hotels and discuss things with the managers 
 then when the rest of us arrived she has every employee on staff that morning take some time and write up every bad experience we had ever had with dumb ol deeds 
 the she faxed it all to the owner of the hotel where he had just got a new job called the desk to see when the owner would be in took a <unk> until said time then called the owner back to outline the situation and suggest they call the other two hotels for first hand <unk> before making a decision 
 when deeds rolled up in the u-haul the owner was waiting with two security guards a restraining order <unk> him from the property her uncle was a judge and did a favor for family a pile of documentation about his terrible behavior and a notified letter <unk> his offer of employment 
 so here was deeds two thousand miles from and friends or family with no job no home and no sympathy 
 tl dr even <unk> did n't have as many people sticking so many knives in his back so you could tell if he was man or <unk> 
 edit : <unk> to appropriate i thought this subreddit might enjoy my tale of long-term revenge though reading other posts of the past couple of months i feel i may be far out of my league here 
 nonetheless may you find some <unk> in my revenge ... <unk> started some years ago 
 ** the culprit culprit was a middle-aged c-level <unk> at my company 
 when i started working there i was informed that culprit had some kind of grudge against the department i worked in not because he was wronged but something he carried with him from his previous job 
 even without the warning culprit did a fine job of making it clear he was a douchebag 
 he had no experience either at the executive level or his department 's function a <unk> function ironically and i found he 'd falsified his resume and his actions made it very clear 
 he <unk> his staff to such an extent the company lost $ 500k in just one instance - and he manipulated this to get a $ <unk> bonus 
 culprit was also the <unk> - if you told him your spaceship cost $ 24 billion he 'd say his cost four solar systems and an ocean of kitten blood 
 this is important 
 at every turn culprit blamed my department for his own <unk> 
 he turned his staff against my department and in a sadistic twist of fate this legacy is directly responsible for much of the company 's current failure - but that 's another story and in *every single <unk> with my department culprit found a way to be <unk> manipulative irritating and a roadblock to success 
 as an example i scheduled a meeting with culprit two other <unk> and <unk> guy in culprit 's department to discuss how to eliminate a massive problem his staff was creating - massive as in causing the company to miss client appointments and pay out lots <unk> lots of money 
 culprit agreed to the meeting time but <unk> *literally* two minutes before - leaving the other <unk> and i hanging out in the conference room which was perhaps 20 feet from culprit 's office 
 when the c-level 's confronted him by walking the 20 feet he said he was busy with stuff '' 
 my blood is boiling even now 
 to avoid a heart explosion in front of my computer please simply trust me on this : culprit is a grade <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shit-eating douchebag 
 and his main target was my cohorts and me 
 <unk> to quite some time later 
 ** by this point my entire department had left the company it was starting to tank and culprit had been laid off with a bunch of other people 
 i was hanging out with my old boss and coworkers when someone mentioned culprit 
 talk went from his douchebaggery to his new job to eventually how delicious it would be to exact some long-term subtle vengeance 
 and dear reader this is how the website was born 
 **the revenge** of idle curiosity i checked to see if www.culpritsfirstandlastname.com had been registered 
 good <unk> it was n't 
 this i <unk> as a sign from on high - and you know what happens when those are ignored whale intestines for those who do n't 
 of course i immediately purchased the domain name paying for the next 10 years in a lump sum 
 definitely worth it 
 then i installed a crappy website framework and threw up a basic blog about page and forum 
 all of these were liberally <unk> with references to culpritsfirstandlastname & lt socially-frowned-upon sexual proclivity & gt '' - which was in fact both the site 's title and the theme of the site itself 
 i wrote blog posts that <unk> culprit 's <unk> and <unk> to his <unk> level of technical skill 
 i <unk> the forums with graphic conversations about socially-frowned-upon sexual proclivity 
 i set up the home page so it displayed the top 20 explicit pictures from a google image search for socially-frowned-upon sexual proclivity 
 i littered culpritsfirstandlastname & lt socially-frowned-upon sexual proclivity & gt about the site like bird <unk> at a <unk> festival 
 <unk> it went a step further 
 ** after setting up the domain registration to change to a different company every three days i started searching for culprit 's name on the internet 
 try searching for your own name you 'll probably get a bunch of <unk> results from <unk> <unk> etc 
 who knew that <unk> can claim and edit those <unk> 
 so i claimed every listing i could find and set www.culpritsfirstandlastname.com as the home page <unk> using different throwaway email addresses 
 i even created profiles for culprit on a few of the sites that did n't already have him and linked to culprit 's new website 
 i can only imagine people casually googling culprit 's name clicking the seemingly innocent www.culpritsfirstandlastname.com link and running horrified from the explicit pictures that show up on the home page 
 it helps me sleep at night 
 every once in a while i google culprit 's first and last name 
 often www.culpritsfirstandlastname.com comes up as the first or second result 
 sometimes it 's buried on the second page 
 every time though i get warm fuzzies thinking about how permanent online information is and how hard it is to remove something from the internet 
 good luck culprit getting anyone to take you seriously again 
 *tl dr : why did you click 
 *so back when i was 14 i played ball in an <unk> summer league 
 i play <unk> so i called all the pitches by the normal routine of putting fingers down to <unk> which pitch i wanted thrown 
 anyways were playing a game against a good team and its pretty close 
 however there was this one big <unk> on the other team who would always look back at my signs while he was in the batters box to steal what pitch was coming 
 every time he did it i told him to stop being a pussy and just play the game 
 he did not <unk> 
 so after he got two base hits i was pretty fed up so i told my teammates 
 my one teammate kevin came up with the idea to flip him off the next time he looked 
 i thought this was a great idea 
 in comes the troll into the batters box and without a doubt he starts to steal my signs again 
 after the first pitch i called time and met with the pitcher on the mound and told him that i was going to flip this kid off and to then throw at his head 
 he was down with the get down 
 so i assume my position and see the kid peering into my crotch again for the signs 
 i flip him the ol bird and start laughing 
 the kid then exits the box and starts throwing a <unk> fit about how i flipped him off '' 
 the umpire is confused and thinks the kid says i was flicking him with my hand so he tells me to cut that out 
 i keep laughing but the kid is still aggravated 
 the <unk> then tells the kid to get into the box and play ball 
 he eventually does 
 the next pitch comes right at his head and he <unk> out of the way 
 at this point my entire team knows whats going on especially our large first baseman will 
 the kid is <unk> but continues to try and steal signs and **every time he looks i give him the middle finger 
 ** the balls and strikes count gets to <unk> and so i call for a curveball no middle finger and whisper to the kid that a curveball is coming and that i bet he couldnt hit it 
 well the curveball comes hits the dirt and he swings and misses 
 we were playing regulation and since i didnt catch the ball cleanly the kid could try to advance to first 
 he does exactly that but remember this kid is not the fastest player 
 i calmly throw the ball to first base and he is out by a mile 
 our first baseman will catches the ball and stands directly on the bag pretty much blocking the kids way 
 the kid flustered then tries to bulldoze will 
 will is huge and stuffs him with ease and the kid gets <unk> to the ground 
 the umpire comes over and <unk> the kid out of the game 
 the kid starts crying and <unk> still laughing 
 ** we won the game and i was a <unk> away from the cycle 
 tl : dr fat kid tries to steal my <unk> signs during baseball game 
 i give him the finger get him aggravated strike him out and then get him tossed from the game 
 i went to a boarding school in rural australia which had a problem with the leading brothers abusing kids a problem that went on for decades 
 the older of us would try to protect the younger but there was only so much we could do 
 at the time the police were very closely tied with the school and turned a blind eye to all but the worst behaviour and it took one hell of a lot of effort to even have that exposed 
 thankfully through the long work of some of my <unk> from the time the problems have come to light and <unk> are being made 
 back in the 70s and 80s we were powerless kids though 
 after i left school one of the worst of the brothers was clearly still active 
 a few of us wanted revenge that 'd hurt him 
 not too long after we were informed of the dates he took for a choir tour during the christmas break 
 at the beginning of that summer we went and collected meat milk dog shit and all manner of stinky items and broke into his car he had this <unk> mercedes he was all too proud of and placed it under the seats to ferment in the heat 
 a couple of days later we realised roadkill would do a great number on it and we dropped the better part of a whole <unk> in the back seat 
 and so it went on for another six weeks until he returned 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> birds of all kinds and a couple of <unk> we stacked the inside of his <unk> with roadkill up to the dash 
 by the end we needed to mask ourselves to even approach the car the stench was coming out the vents 
 our quarry returned and we heard nothing of the car or the attack until a <unk> later when he disappeared 
 no information on where he went where he moved to what became of him until the <unk> when some of his deeds became public and so many adults came out of the woodwork with the knowledge of support and he stood no chance 
 last i heard he was still in <unk> 
 for a while i regretted what i helped do 
 i felt i should have done more and instead of playing around behind the scenes doing the somewhat heavy handed passive aggressive thing i should have worked hard to bring this man <unk> speaking to others affected has made me realise none of us ever had the power to do that alone and it was only after half a lifetime and a complete swing in the country 's culture against respect for <unk> like my old school that it could successfully be exposed 
 now i 'm proud of the small part i played in making his life <unk> dad went to college at <unk> madison and would ride his bike between his classes 
 now as some of you may know in winter it gets very cold in madison it 's not uncommon for it to be 10-15 degrees below zero 
 on one of these freezing cold days my dad was <unk> to class wearing his heavy ski mask and <unk> to protect him from the weather 
 as he rode down the street he saw ahead of him a man pulling out of his driveway in his car this man saw my dad approaching on his bike as he was backing out made full eye contact with him and then abruptly continued out into the street hitting my dad knocking him off his bike and bending the frame 
 at this point my dad collected himself and upon seeing the man driving away hopped back onto his now bent bike and began to chase him 
 now i should mention my dad grew up in a fairly sketchy neighborhood in chicago and as a <unk> of being held up one to many times carried a <unk> buck knife in a holster on his side at all times 
 as he was chasing this man in his car my dad pulled off his mitten with his mouth grabbed the knife and <unk> it 
 at this point the man driving the car looked in his rear view mirror and saw my dad in his <unk> ski mask holding a mitten in his mouth and a large buck knife in his hand rapidly approaching 
 his reaction was to speed up and run a red light at the next intersection at which point he was promptly <unk> by another car 
 as if this was n't enough revenge a police car also happened to be waiting at the intersection and pulled up with their lights flashing to the car at which point my dad folded his knife removed his ski mask and rode by slowly smiling and waving 
 tl dr my dad was riding his bike a guy in a car looked at him then hit him my dad chased him with a knife the dude then crashed his car and got <unk> an update i 'm still owed my money but my war is n't totally <unk> or over 
 for those who do n't remember my ex employer took me for about 10k 
 they <unk> back salary into shares based by convincing people based on deceitful <unk> and empty promises 
 i reported them to the cra for tax fraud because they used <unk> tax credits incorrectly essentially using research credits for private profits 
 i also reported them for every criminal act i could think of and contacted partners to inform them of how deceitful the company is 
 i have no information on the audit if it 's happening or the progress or outcome 
 i am not on the loop on that but the cra did say they would be randomly '' audited shortly 
 however given that i do n't see the insides of the company i ca n't say much i can however say that the big application i wrote for them is no longer in the wild 
 it appears i 've help ensure that the company lost one of it 's biggest contracts and that alone should financially <unk> any money they owe me 
 i ran into the ceo today and sat down for a informal discussion 
 he claimed he ca n't pay me because then he 'd have to pay everyone 
 very much a bullshit claim and easily worked around 
 they could partially buy back shares from everyone and work towards being in the clear but clearly their interest is to <unk> their money and continue being dishonest scumbags 
 i will be filing in small claims to reclaim my money and will try and do another update then but for now i 'd like to at least say that i 've done enough damage to the company that paying me would have been the easy solution 
 everything else is just cake from this point forward 
 either the audit will fuck them entirely and i 'll possibly get my money back but at least in fucking them i 've been successful 
 the revenge component is done now i 'm just <unk> <unk> not sure if this is petty or pro ... i lost my job a couple years ago and had to move out of state 
 the owner of the apartments i moved to hired me to be the maintenance guy i was the first repair man she had that was n't hooked on meth 
 i agreed to lower than minimum wage but it was under the table so i was sorta ok with it at the time 
 i worked my ass off she would give me one to two days to turn apartments over 
 i laid carpet linoleum paint you name it i did it 
 i cleaned the <unk> places in the world 
 fast forward 2 years ... i was needing some money to <unk> my id so i asked for a check most of the time i just applied my wages to the rent she shut me down and said she did n't have the money i was n't able to get my id so i was n't able to take another job 
 i was stuck being her slave that summer i had a apartment that needed to have all new everything even toilet 
 the place was a mess 
 she had another <unk> help out but his gf went into labor that night so he was n't able to help ... <unk> was she never adjusted for his absence and called for a inspection for 3 days after i started ... i half killed myself to finish in time the night of the second day i hurt my back trying to lay carpet by myself ... my back hurt really bad so bad it was hard to walk 
 she was informed that i was injured but did n't seem to believe me she was only worried about the inspection 
 i <unk> out as much as i could and finished in time to pass 
 my back was hurt so bad i was laid out for a solid month crazy pain 
 i 've never felt that type of pain before ... two weeks in she bought a bunch of <unk> dust and plants for the yard 
 i was doing the best i could but it was hard to even walk but i was getting it done 
 she noticed i was n't working as fast as she wanted and decided to give me a lesson on how to use a shovel like i do n't know it really started to make my blood boil but i tried to keep my mouth shut but she was n't done ... she went on to give me a speech about how she needed the biggest bang '' for her buck 
 wrong thing for her to say considering i 'm the first guy to not rob her blind and i was n't even getting min wage and could even get a check when i needed it most ... i lost it threw the tools down and walked of 
 fast forward a week i decided it was time to move 
 i found a better job and was getting ready to move ... i still could n't forget the biggest bang '' speech just could n't let it go ... <unk> i took weed killer to all the bushes she just bought and drilled small holes in all 14 metal <unk> 
 tl : dr do n't forget to get the biggest bang for your <unk> this is n't quite the normal revenge story as it all happened in a video game specifically eve online a spaceship mmo 
 now for those that do n't know it eve online is to hardcore gamers what hardcore gamers are to regular people 
 it 's the most insane of the insane 
 shit happens in eve that does n't happen anywhere else 
 <unk> the <unk> basically have no rules in playing some very basic do n't abuse bugs - scamming stealing etc 
 is all fair game 
 it 's also slightly complicated : 
 there is something called plex '' which can be bought for ~ $ 20 real money and sold in-game 
 it grants additional <unk> and is a way to estimate in-game money to real money 
 enter me 
 bored depressed looking for something to do 
 i decided to try yet another mmo '' and see how it went 
 i joined one of the newbie organizations and it was miserable 
 i learned but they were very <unk> 
 so i jumped ship to an alliance in <unk> high risk high reward space and part of one of the larger coalitions at the time 
 members - & gt corporations - & gt <unk> - & gt coalitions 
 there were <unk> rules and it was more freeing and fun to play 
 i quite enjoyed myself for a time but there was something i could n't shake off 
 the other members of the coalition 
 they were toxic they belittled and berated everyone for trying to do anything for trying to help for trying to make things better 
 anyone did something and it was met with a chorus of jeers 
 i liked the alliance the coalition but i could n't stand the members 
 they 'd go so far as to even occasionally scam each other and i got hit by this once 
 most questions i had or mistakes i made were met with a torrent of abuse 
 i quickly grew to hate the individuals 
 but i could n't jump ship again 
 i was a marked man having been in this alliance 
 i decided on revenge instead 
 having a large amount of time on my hands i discovered something that i could do as a relatively newish player that most players did n't like doing that i enjoyed and with all my time i was able to do it a bunch leading to some minor appreciation of my work among the very few people who tried to keep the whole mess running 
 again to choruses of jeers 
 i earned a slight reputation and constant posting on the forums made me a known person 
 so i started an investment doing all of the math showing people how it was a good idea and asking for a modest but not outrageous amount of money 
 i managed to get it and slowly paid it back over months time 
 for reference this tale <unk> almost 9 months 
 i continued my activities and slowly got promoted through the ranks 
 i dipped and <unk> here and there always polite always helpful 
 slowly my access grew and i was eventually invited to an inner money-making scheme where we trusted each other with good chunks of our money for all of us to make much more 
 now with such a large group owning large amounts of rich money-making space with such toxic people how were we not invaded and kicked out of our space 
 how did we get it in the first place 
 we had a big brother '' bb who <unk> helped us get this space and it was well-known that anyone who messed with us was also messing with bb 
 this kept us safe except for skirmishes and people were willing to show up for skirmishes they knew we 'd win 
 time goes by 
 my activities lead me to being essentially inner circle but not quite - the inner circle would decide things then task me and only me to do them and i became <unk> head of intelligence for this very large <unk> members coalition 
 and i still hated their guts 
 and i still bided my time 
 i paid off the investment in full - smaller amounts than this had been scams and by this point i was fully trusted 
 around this point bb decided they had enough of us that we did n't deserve our space and that they were <unk> us 
 my plan <unk> i knew i wanted to deal massive amounts of damage but this gave me the chance to do even more and i promptly messaged the head of bb explaining who i was what my plan was and would they like some help 
 i was granted with doubt this has never worked before '' everyone who 's ever offered to turn coats has been a plant '' and they <unk> asked me what i wanted in return for my services 
 i told them i wanted nothing i just hated the coalition with a deep burning passion and wanted to see them burn 
 i had been mentioning a plan for a <unk> scale investment and money making opportunity for awhile now and immediately put it into effect 
 to make it look legitimate i had set the entire thing up as if it would actually happen giving so many layers to the deception that no amount of investigating would reveal any inconsistencies 
 i asked for an outrageous amount and due to my previous activities and reputation i got it and more 
 the stage was set 
 the invasion began and as head of intelligence i was in charge of making all of our intelligence spreadsheets google docs were used i made them all handled the access and <unk> and they were the only source of a large amount of our intelligence and i coordinated <unk> during battles 
 while in the command channels to better relay the intel 
 while streaming the command channels to bb 's commanders so they had perfect intel of what we were thinking and what we were going to do 
 while gaining <unk> access to most of the command forums 
 i know at least two alliance fleets died without a fight due to the intel <unk> 
 i suspect many more fleets got killed as a result 
 at last the moment was ripe 
 i had gotten the massive investment i had access to various alliance assets i was still in the money-making group that gave each other assets and i was the owner of the intel documents 
 i stole it all then proceeded to wipe all access to the intel documents 
 i got away with so much stuff that i literally could n't count how much i had managed to get 
 i copied the command forums 
 i finished it off with a taunting message to everyone in the coalition 
 bb shortly won the war and the alliance shortly fell apart and offered me a spot 
 i happily accepted and they 're a much nicer bunch of people internally 
 they 're not nice to <unk> i 've been pretty happy ever since my life 's turned around and all in all operation successful 
 be nice to your teammates 
 you never know what they can do 
 tl dr : the people i was playing with were mean 
 i helped burn their <unk> to the ground and stole everything not nailed down 
 edit : i forgot to mention the final loot tally 
 it took me a few weeks to sell scrap or donate i gave stuff to some of the actually nice <unk> who lost everything and would be quitting <unk> literally everyone who asked me for some and still ended up with <unk> billion isk in loot 
 a plex at the time sold for <unk> isk 
 remember a plex costs almost $ 20 
 edit 2 : forgot to mention i got to the point where i had the alliance paying for my <unk> 
 edit 3 : since i was asked i realized i did n't post the value of a fleet 
 fleets in eve for <unk> of the type we were engaged in are fought primarily by <unk> with a <unk> one cost around <unk> 
 then there are a huge number of support ships usually costing less <unk> cost a ton more but i wo n't get into them to the point where a fleet could well be <unk> <unk> 
 for the sake of numbers let 's say the average ship cost 200m 
 fleet cap out at 255 people but often multiple fleets are created to form one large fleet ... <unk> still called a fleet 
 from here on out i 'll just reference the one large fleet 
 so i got two of them blown up at around <unk> people each time with ships costing something like 200m per person 
 if anyone who has a higher understanding of fleet <unk> and costs wants to help edit these numbers i 'd be glad to take <unk> i know backstory is boring so i 'll make it brief 
 i have a fairly serious speech <unk> 
 it 's gotten better as i 've grown and developed confidence but it still gets me at really awkward moments 
 as a result i am fairly quiet and hang out with a small <unk> group of friends 
 at the time of this incident i was 14 years old and in reasonable physical shape 
 i am in the new zealand <unk> corps so i 'm an experienced camper and enjoy being in the outdoors 
 at the end of year 10 grade 9 in the us everyone in my <unk> went on a <unk> hike 
 we were meant to travel <unk> each day so fairly challenging 
 now it is at this point in my story that the <unk> shows his ugly face 
 i 'll call him blimp because that 's what he was shaped like 
 he was fat nearly obese 
 he constantly mocked me and my speech difficulty 
 as luck would have it we ended up in the same <unk> group 
 the first day of the <unk> began fine 
 blimp ate two days worth of food <unk> himself with candy he 'd brought from home 
 because of his weight he slowed down the group and by the end of the day we 'd only gone <unk> 
 at the end of the day i lay in my sleeping bag and the <unk> of an idea crept into my mind 
 on the morning of the second day i suggested to our instructor that we increase the pace 
 he was reluctant at first but i reminded him that we only had two days left and we had to travel almost <unk> so he <unk> 
 we set off at a cracking pace 
 since everyone in the group was reasonably fit all of us could easily keep going 
 all of us that is except for blimp 
 you can probably guess what happens next : blimp was forced to run in order to keep up and by lunchtime he was sobbing in pain shame and fear of being left behind 
 **edit : realised i need a tl : dr so here it is : fat bullying shithead is shamed on a forced march 
 **i 'm going to share my story of a girl that changed my life 
 originally it was in a good way but then it got bad 
 then worse 
 then kinda good 
 then really bad and <unk> 
 so here 's how it begins : in the summer after my freshman year of college i met this girl 25 who was older than me 19 but she and i had a lot of mutual interests especially the games we played so we started talking 
 she always seemed like the hard exterior type and i assumed that she had no interest in me 
 but then we started talking more and more and i realized she was definitely attracted to me 
 she told me about her divorce how he beat her and cheated on her and my heart just melted 
 she was such a good person and no one deserves that kind of treatment 
 even after this whole ordeal i still would never wish that upon her because that 's fucking <unk> and awful 
 we started to get closer as we talked about our <unk> our interests etc 
 we connected a lot 
 it had been <unk> months since the divorce and she was just starting to feel good again and knowing that i was a part of that made me happy to help her 
 soon enough we realized we had true feelings for each other and wanted to pursue something more than just friendship 
 so we did 
 now here 's one thing that i 'm going to be honest about 
 this was my first serious relationship 
 in my past i have been with girls and only said yes to the <unk> label because they wanted to 
 i was just looking for some fun but i was fine with moving forward if it meant that we could still have fun 
 ironically i 'd actually start to get feelings and then the relationship would wind up ending 
 so naturally i had my walls up and decided to just start playing it safe 
 and then i met this girl 
 for once it did n't start physical it started emotional 
 i was getting feelings and then i started getting physical 
 it felt like things were going right 
 hell 
 fucking 
 no 
 let 's call this girl bitch 
 so bitch and i started off amazingly well 
 we 'd have phone convos at night that ended with us falling asleep together we 'd have skype dates and we 'd game together 
 it was getting awesome and i felt so close to her but now here 's where i should mention one thing : we never made our relationship public 
 she wanted to keep it <unk> since she was still getting over her divorce '' 
 well after the breakup i realized that she was ashamed of me and i 'm guessing it had to do with the age difference 
 the funny thing is she and i talked about meeting each other 's parents a lot and how it would be awesome for each of us given our personalities 
 she meant so much to me and i would talk her through all the panic attacks she 'd have and try to be the best guy to her 
 i fucked up in my previous relationships but this time i refused 
 i wanted to be the good guy 
 the sweet guy 
 the great boyfriend 
 hell i remember one time she posted one of those pictures with the quote a good guy wakes you up at 3am to tell you he loves you '' and had the he loves you '' crossed out and above it saying with cookies and ice cream '' 
 so for our three month anniversary i sent her a box of <unk> cookies and a gift card to cold stone and she was so happy and whatnot about it 
 okay enough of this sappy shit 
 it 's time to get to the bad parts 
 first of all around five months into the relationship she just stopped talking to me 
 i got really confused but assumed that she needed her space 
 i would still reach out every now and then 
 then on thanksgiving she tells me that she was relapsing with memories from her ex-husband and i understood and told her that we 'd take a break 
 the day after new year 's she called me crying saying how she wanted me in her life and how she loves me so naturally i felt great again and said yes 
 1-2 months into this new relationship and i started realizing that one of the guys that used to game with us we played <unk> <unk> wow etc. for proper context would always be extra <unk> with her 
 and she would giggle about it and be the same way back 
 naturally i would n't say hey fuck off talking to my girl like that '' because we still had n't made our relationship public yet 
 i would talk to her about it in private and she told me that he was just like a brother to her and that 's all 
 i had some apprehension because i 've been in fucked up situations in my past with cheating but i trusted her 
 so i 'd tolerate everything that happened and just took it on the chin 
 another 3 months later she broke up with me 
 i was planning on studying abroad at that point so her breaking up with me definitely set me off on a fuck this shit '' note and i left for london with a <unk> state of mind 
 i hated the world and did n't give a shit about anyone 
 once i started deciding to work out i made friends with other guys who made it their summer goal to help me through this by showing me the proper <unk> for the <unk> i was doing and even helped me gain my confidence back through this 
 i started meeting girls even had some fun throughout this and things were going well 
 i was finally starting to wake up in the mornings in a neutral state rather than fuck the world '' 
 but then i found out 
 turns out that bitch fucked that brother '' friend of hers and less than a week after i left he actually drove down to where she lived to spend quite a lot of time with her 
 i hear from him directly how this had been going on for quite some time and that he was having a great time with her he saw me as a friend and had no idea of my relationship with bitch 
 i hope 
 so now i was back to fuck everything 
 my friends at the gym still helped me but this time i was lost 
 i was empty 
 i was worthless 
 i thought that i was never meant to have a serious relationship 
 i thought this was all for nothing 
 and then i get a call closer to the end of the summer 
 i had been working while studying abroad and had been making quite a bit of money doing it 
 it was helping me to know that while learning a lot i was saving a lot too 
 i had talked to her well before our breakup when we were talking about the possibility of moving in and i said how i 'd wanted to save up during the summer anyways so at least it 's for something <unk> 
 she was living with a relative so she was excited at the thought of us living together 
 so this call was from her telling me how her house wound up getting burned down from some electrical issue i think i loose wire or something 
 and she was upset and did n't know what to do 
 she even told me how her dog died that dog was adorable and amazing i actually felt bad for her because she was a good girl 
 i was just shocked 
 i wanted to feel terrible for her but i was just ... not 
 the caring part of me wanted to help her 
 but after all of this crap with her cheating and talking to this guy while taking gifts from me and ignoring me oh one thing i should mention 
 my grandfather died during our relationship and she did n't really console me 
 like all she did was tell me how it was much worse for her when her grandfather died and start crying and get me to console her 
 whenever i truly needed her and oh she never fucking told any of her friends or family about me i just could n't bring myself to care 
 i wanted to show that i was truly fucking done with her and that after all that she 's done to me she does n't deserve any of my love and caring 
 she asked me if i could help in any way to send money to her in order to help her out 
 when i told her i 'd think about it she said that if possible a check would be best and that she 'd really appreciate it 
 that 's when i realized what i could do 
 i wanted to be slightly subtle vindictive and spiteful all at the same time 
 while i definitely loved her dog i know that bitch loved her dog so much more 
 so i asked her for her address and told her i 'd send a check 
 she said thank you and then said she had to go and hung up 
 yes exactly like that 
 she did n't even say bye she literally said i have to go now thank you '' and hung the fuck up 
 so i sent her a huge package of dog food with an attached note saying i 'm sorry for your loss '' 
 i blocked her on my phone facebook and steam after that 
 tl dr bitch cheated on me for the majority of our relationship tried to get me to help pay for her burned down home well after breaking up with me and me finding out about the cheating so i bought her food for the <unk> remains of her dead <unk> a few years back my brother-in-law bil young guy in his early 30 's was diagnosed with cancer 
 our family is was pretty close and everyone took it fairly hard 
 at the time i also happened to be looking for a new place to live 
 well my bil and sister have a few rental properties and were looking at buying another one 
 they asked if i would be willing to rent it if they did 
 being a single female in my early 20 's i stressed to them i probably could n't afford it but if it was in my price range of course i would but i also asked them if they should really be <unk> on that right now maybe you should take care of bil 's cancer and worry about your real estate when he 's better ... anyways you ca n't tell them what to do at all and they bought a house anyways 
 well they told me i could rent the basement suite for less then my max price because they know i 'll take care of it 
 i agree and we go about things 
 well as i 'm moving in they bring me a lease contract to sign but the rent is over $ 200 more than what i had told them my max price was 
 i question them about it with my crap half moved in naturally and they kind of <unk> me by saying things like <unk> we thought it would be okay and 'i guess we forgot to factor in a b and c. 
 <unk> '' i think to myself but arguing with your bil that has cancer is extremely difficult so i reluctantly sign and accept my lack of social life due to my inflated rent 
 fast forward to last year my bil is getting significantly worse and given under 3 months to live 
 i made the trip to the hospital 1.5 hours away several times as much as i could afford and often caught rides up there as well and he looked bad 
 as in i did n't think he 'd make it another month bad 
 in canada where we live health care only does so much and basically told him there was nothing left they could do for him 
 well i did some research and found a specialized cancer treatment center in the states that gave him a shot at beating it 
 i asked my sister to make a few calls knowing more than i did about his specific situation and see if they pull take him 
 she told me they would but it was far to expensive 
 i asked how much and she said <unk> 75 000 
 i immediately got together with friends and family about starting to raise some money i had also found out the they did n't have life insurance with 2 small children and they would lose everything when bil died essentially they were right fucked 
 now i 'm not the type of person to hold events or generally just be social at all 
 i actually have mild social anxiety and dropped out of college because of it but i somehow managed to rally together the entire community 
 a friend started them a <unk> page and gave my sister control my sister also started a second one on <unk> 
 i found a place that would give us 200 seats free in a bar for a fundraiser in which we could sell ticket to 
 unfortunately it was around christmas time and the only date they had available was a last minute cancellation ... about a week and a half away 
 now i do n't know if any of you have thrown any type of event but that 's not enough time to organize crap like that 
 somehow and do n't ask me how because it was such a blur and i do n't think i slept at all i managed to organize hundreds of people find a band sell all of our tickets collect auction donations create <unk> to bring in more money get several large corporations to donate <unk> find decorations create a <unk> and get a ton of personal donations over 5000 dollars to be presented to the family because they were going through a tough time ... all while working a full time job 
 while planning i became extremely concerned with the <unk> and expressed that in depth to my team 
 all auction items must be watched at all times all money must be tracked all paperwork copied and account for etc 
 i also told my sister to not worry about a thing just worry about taking care of bil 
 while she not only <unk> by completely <unk> to do everything she insisted on doing but talking down to me and ignoring all of the important things i was trying to express she was actually a huge bitch the entire time 
 i tried to shake it off assuming she was just stressed 
 a few days before the fundraiser i tried to get the treatment center info from my sister for my speech but she kept blowing me off so i called the center myself 
 the <unk> that my sister were asking were completely different than what the girl on the phone told me 
 at the end of the conversation the girl says so you 're bil 's sister 
 that 's so weird 
 his wife called the other day and did n't seem nearly as interested in the payment options as you are 
 around the same time i noticed my sister has changed to fundraising goals from 70 000 to 175 000. i was far too busy to give it much thought at this point though 
 so the day of the fundraiser my sister walks in and i say genuinely pleased to see her oh awesome 
 you made it 
 have you decided if you want to be involved at all '' 
 she <unk> and says i do n't even want to fucking be here '' 
 i 'm a pretty ballsy person and any other day i would have promptly punched her in the face and walked out but this was for my bil so i smiled and said oh i 'm really sorry to hear that 
 why do n't you have a seat my dad and just relax put all your food and drink on my bill and i 'll take care of it 
 we 've got you a ride home if you want to drink and i 'll take care of everything else for you 
 i love ya <unk> '' 
 as <unk> host and the main organizer of <unk> i was running around like a chicken either my head cut off the whole night 
 the only times i saw my sister was sitting on other guys laps bitching about her husband bidding on auction items how fucking <unk> or telling her friends i 'm a cunt she also was a bitch to my friends and had i known that at the time i would have called it off right then and there - you do not fuck with my friends who have supported not only me but you through this 
 about half way through the event one of my team had approached me telling me a gift card had gone missing 
 fuck 
 that 's all on me 
 i quickly rallied everyone to help but my sister had quickly come over and told everyone it was taken care of 
 i forgot about it until my friend that donated that gift certificate showed up and asked about it 
 i had no answer and sister was effectively evading me all night 
 the next day since the fundraiser ended up running until after 2am i called around to everyone except my sister looking for the gift card 
 i put about 9 people 's stories together to figure out what happened 
 my sister stole the fucking gift card 
 for herself 
 from her dying husbands fundraiser 
 then she blamed everything on me and made a bunch of wild false accusations 
 basically i got numerous phone calls texts e-mails and facebook messages to the point i had to shut my phone off and <unk> my facebook telling me what an awful person i am and how could i steal something from bil 's fundraiser and blame it on my poor sister 
 <unk> what 
 what 
 that 's good for my depression and anxiety 
 so i called my mom bawling telling her i wanted to die and i do n't understand 
 she yelled at me and told me to apologize to my sister 
 fuck that - i did n't speak to anyone in my family for over 9 months 
 i had concrete evidence proving she did it 
 i could have got her charged 
 i spent my entire vacation fund on them and did n't even get a fucking thank you 
 my theory that i <unk> together a few weeks after is that my sister expected bil to die before we could raise the money to send him for treatment leaving her with a nice little chuck of money to take care of her stupidly expensive lifestyle 3 very expensive vehicles 4 houses property on a lake a holiday trailer quad boat etc 
 well shit i do n't do anything half-assed 
 within a few days we had raised half the money by the end he had enough to go before she changed the total 
 out of the 70 000 or so raised i single <unk> raised over 50 000. also who leaves their dying husband as home to look after their 2 small children under 5 to go to mexico 
 a week after the fundraiser 
 i decide to let herself shoot herself in the foot and just move out of the house they owned asap 
 this happened to <unk> with their <unk> trip and they tried to sue me 
 they had no grounds to do so and i actually ended up with 50 bucks from them - ha 
 but now i 'm getting a little revenge 
 i could n't bring myself to tell the entire world what they did though i easily could have but i did decide to fuck with them 
 while i lived in the rental i did a bunch of work on it for them for free so there was plenty of extra paint <unk> etc around 
 i looked up the most common and <unk> <unk> in our area and how to <unk> them 
 then i went shopping 
 the list included fish heads shrimp pest <unk> clearance meat etc 
 i left the place immaculate 
 except for the rotting food in the walls 
 yup 
 i punched a hole in the wall filled it up in several places <unk> <unk> and painted over it 
 i hear the place is <unk> now and going through renovations 
 tl dr : i spent an obscene amount of time and money on a fundraiser that my sister stole a gift card from and blamed on me so i filled the walls of her rental house with rotting food 
 edit : a word 
 edit 2 : for those asking my bil is still alive though i have heard his health is <unk> 
 so far as i know things change quickly around here and i do n't really care enough to keep up he has not been send to the treatment center that we all <unk> for 
 they say they ca n't afford it which is a lie i know all the numbers of the fundraiser and how much it was to send him there 
 they have not sold a single thing they own but he is supposedly attending treatment a province over 
 they say that the money is going towards that but the treatment itself is actually free 
 i believe they have used some of the money to fly him over for treatment 
 that 's all i really know ... hi prorevenge 
 i 'm posting here on the suggestion of some fine people over at <unk> 
 this story chronicles how someone got what was coming to them even in the otherwise powerless position of an employee in a customer is always right '' society 
 <unk> : wall of text <unk> i 'll preface by saying that i 've been working in a grocery store for over a year now and have culminated my own collection of <unk> <unk> with people <unk> on making everyone around them despise their entire existence 
 this story starts with my second day out of training on a register as a cashier 
 it is currently super doubles '' week where our store will double the value of coupons up to $ 2 meaning a $ 2.00 coupon is worth $ <unk> for <unk> workers 
 this is obviously very bad for a new employee because the store gets a very bad case of the <unk> '' and 1 in 3 customers will actively try to scam you to get away with <unk> or fake coupons 
 management does n't seem to mind however and i 'm thrown on a register still quite nervous about the job unsure of what to expect 
 fast forward 4 hours later : i 'm approaching the end of my shift i 'm a little more confident and more <unk> and have already seen a lot of really scummy customers 
 then <unk> comes to my lane 
 barely <unk> '' of <unk> blonde <unk> hair a <unk> purse a torn <unk> sweater and bunny slippers 
 yes that 's right bunny slippers 
 it to be referred to as ms. a is an infamous customer who is unbeknownst to me at the time notorious for picking out new employees and scamming them 
 she has picked me out because she spent hours at a time in the store for around a week to see who is new who pays attention to what and who her best option is 
 really if it was n't pathetic i 'd be impressed 
 anyway the transaction goes <unk> and she being a veteran scumbag gets away with 3-4 coupons off her total 
 i am told this by the customer service clerk csc who reviewed my till 
 it was at that time i vowed to get her back and get her back good because beyond being rude and smelling a little like <unk> she had a smug look of hah i 'm better than you and you work in a low job where you ca n't even say anything about it '' 
 you see i 'm a vindictive sonofabitch and i really do n't like getting taken advantage of 
 as a preparation for my plan i took a picture of the coupons she used with my phone and stashed them back in the folder where they are kept 
 fast forward 5 months : i am now a self-checkout clerk 
 much better at the job now the csc who first told me about ms. a scamming me is a good friend of mine at this point 
 another super doubles week is upon us and ms. a sure enough makes another appearance 
 same slippers same purse same hair 
 i ask the csc if she can make a copy of the transaction ms. a makes by using the customer service desk computer 
 the csc agrees staying that it 's probably a good idea if she ever does get caught 
 ms. a knows not to try going through my line by now as i am experienced so she goes to a newer cashier to try to scam 
 i go to the new cashier 's station to help her bag 
 i do n't say anything about the coupons despite blatant scamming but i do snap a picture of the coupons and grab a copy of the receipt from the csc at the end of the shift to store away 
 ms. a came in 2 more times that week and repeated the procedure i was able to collect evidence at 1 of the instances 
 fast forward 3 months : i am now a <unk> <unk> veteran of retail working as a csc dealing with the worst <unk> that society can cough up at me 
 i have now culminated about 13 <unk> transactions that ms. a has pushed through a register at this point all showing in rather great detail what items were voided how many coupons were used and even what the value of the coupons were and when they were scanned 
 my old csc friend is a co-manager at this point and has been in on my plan for vengeance for a while now and is actively trying to help me catch her in the act 
 during a slow day my friend calls me from the front desk to her office 
 she says she has a plan to deal with ms. a for good : she will ask the security guard who watches self-checkout when the <unk> are pulled at night to contact the police to be on standby during our upcoming super doubles week 
 i did n't know that it was possible to request that police remain on standby for such issues but somehow my co-manager friend did it 
 fast forward 1 month : super doubles 
 i prepare for a rough week of but i want this with this coupon they 're the same thing '' 
 and why did n't this coupon that says 'do not double double '' 
 then it happens 
 ms. a <unk> into the store 
 i hear over my <unk> ms. a is here <unk> tell the security guard '' 
 i <unk> do and sit back <unk> waiting for the fireworks 
 ms. a <unk> unaware of the world of pain about to be lowered on her slowly <unk> the shelves for what she wants for over 2 hours if you 've worked in retail before you know these types of people 
 do n't they ever get bored of going from store to store 
 christ go watch some tv or something 
 she goes to a very new cashier and proceeds to attempt scam the hell out of the poor girl asking to <unk> one item add another scan one coupon clear another item then add another item 
 a relatively simple confusion <unk> used to get away with getting extra coupons 
 <unk> clarity purposes : i will <unk> that this is fraud and theft 
 do n't do it and if you do stop it 
 all the employees know your face name and buying habits 
 ** i make a copy of the register 's actions up front as i always do with ms. a but this time was different 
 as soon as ms. a swipes her card two police officers <unk> walk up to ms. a and ask her to step aside and speak for a moment 
 ms. a obviously distressed yells no 
 leave me alone i 'm doing nothing '' and tries to push past the officers 
 the two officers are not in the business of dealing with her crap and quickly grab her and take her aside bunny slippers in tow 
 her <unk> purse still on the counter 
 the purse <unk> <unk> on the edge falls over after the commotion 
 3 unopened bottles of <unk> and a 16 pack of <unk> batteries roll out onto the desk 
 i could n't contain my laughter and i said aloud fucking score '' 
 and then proceed to close off the cashier 's lane and guide customers elsewhere 
 ms. a. did n't return a police officer came and took the purse the day 's security tapes my copies of the months of transactions and took a picture of the attempted stolen goods 
 nothing else was said about ms. a for quite some time 
 fast forward to yesterday evening 
 my co-manager friend and i are at the front desk she is working in the front office in accounting and i am counting <unk> from the day 
 i hear her on the phone nothing too unusual 
 a little laughing muffled speaking and so on 
 she steps out from the office with a grin from ear to ear 
 ms. a just got convicted of theft and some drug charges long jail time from what i understand 
 your transaction records pretty much sealed the case '' 
 apparently the dm of the store personally was at the court to see how it all played out 
 holy 
 shit 
 best day ever 
 see i like to think i learned something about the nature of retail and the customer is always right '' at the end of this ordeal : it 's just a <unk> game to see who is willing to step in shit enough times to eventually start smelling so bad they ca n't deny it anymore 
 it may not always work but when it does sweet baby jesus it 's like christmas and when they do catch the people responsible like ms. a quickly found out they soon learn that there are no coupons for <unk> mom lives in a college town with her partner and one of her <unk> is gardening 
 they like to sit out on the porch on nice nights and were doing just that when a drunk college bro parks in front of their house and starts walking through their front garden 
 my mom points out that he 's walking through her garden and he calls her a <unk> cunt and continues on to their neighbors still through her garden who are throwing a party 
 mom # 2 who is pretty handy takes a valve <unk> remover to his tires and within minutes all four of his tires are flat 
 drunk college bro returns to his car now even drunker does n't notice and drives off on his rims 
 mom calls the cops 
 this tale reminded me of the time my boss was having lunch and got blocked in by a ups truck 
 the parking in front of the restaurant was <unk> and you had to feed a meter for up to 30 minutes of parking not unreasonable and usually plenty of time to eat lunch or shop 
 <unk> john was a good guy and a good boss but he had his limits 
 these limits were tested when he found his work van blocked in by a ups truck when he came out 
 it was one of those big ones - you know the type 
 this was not the first time so john lit a cigarette and waited patiently before being joined by another person who had parked there and was now blocked in 
 surely the ups driver would be back shortly after all it only takes a few minutes to do a delivery and such <unk> were usually gone in a short amount of time 
 this was not one of those times 
 after about 10 or 15 minutes he began to seek out the offensive driver peeking into several local restaurants & amp shops but no luck 
 the ups van stayed where it was 
 john was running out of cigarettes and patience and he had appointments to keep 
 he then looked inside the open door of the ups truck hoping to find a clue as to where the driver might be 
 clues were not to be found ... but the keys were still in the <unk> 
 <unk> 
 * he looked around again still no sign of the driver 
 so he climbed into the driver seat and started the engine put the massive truck in gear and moved it forward far enough for both him and the other guy remember the other guy who was blocked in 
 could get out 
 but now the truck was in the way of other cars 
 feeling that the rude ups driver had already used up his <unk> of <unk> time he decided to keep going 
 he smiled at the other driver and drove down the street 
 he later described the feeling as a <unk> mix of <unk> and apprehension half expecting a shout of <unk> from the driver or a police <unk> demanding he stop stealing the truck but none came 
 he proceeded to the end of the block then drove past the intersection and around a curve 
 still not good enough 
 he turned into a residential area made another turn and parked the truck next to a fire <unk> and blocking the entrance to an apartment driveway before walking the few blocks back to his truck 
 along the way he stopped at pay phone this was before cell phones and called the local police department and as a concerned citizen reported the illegally parked truck ~ which by that time had been illegally parked for about an hour technically the truth 
 not sure what happened to the truck or the driver ~ john went on to his appointment and we never heard any more 
 but we did notice that ups trucks never parked in that area for more than five minutes after that 
 *edit - <unk> – <unk> <unk> points 5 hours ago <unk> it was april 1st 2012 and i was in <unk> mode for exams 
 i had popped an adderall and was extremely <unk> on my work when all of a sudden my phone buzzed 
 unknown number : <unk> i saw ur ad on cl and i wan na buy ur phone please '' <unk> <unk> i get back to work and within 2 minutes my phone rings 
 a different number 
 hi i 'd like to buy your phone please '' 
 sorry you 've got the wrong number '' 
 as soon as i hang up i realize ... <unk> fuck this is a prank 
 * i get on craig 's list and immediately find out that my roommate is selling my brand new iphone 4 for us $ 100 
 call me asap at <unk> '' *that motherfucker 
 * in the next two hours i got a total of probably 100 calls and texts 
 i was gon na get him back good 
 with the adderall still <unk> through me i racked my brain for the best possible prank i could pull 
 then i remembered i had introduced him to the deep web two days ago 
 we were surfing it we had checked out the <unk> the silk road even the <unk> 's advertisement pages 
 and at one point on his computer we stumbled onto child porn 
 i knew how i was going to prank him 
 when he got home there was an official fbi envelope waiting for him 
 inside **this <unk> i lifted correct names <unk> court addresses court dates and official language other than <unk> <unk> but that did n't really matter 
 as soon as he opened it up he almost started crying 
 i had to tell him it was a prank within seconds because he just broke down 
 i was in an accident that left me unable to work for quite a <unk> 
 it was obvious that i wasn’t at fault – it was an open and shut case but that means nothing until the judge brings his <unk> down 
 the claim <unk> the amount of insurance that the other guys had so the insurance company had nothing to lose by dragging the case out which they did 
 their lawyer managed to get adjournment after adjournment hoping to <unk> me out and settle for a <unk> 
 he almost succeeded 
 in the years following the accident the bills piled up my marriage fell apart and my credit <unk> was destroyed 
 i <unk> and sold anything i had of value just to put food on the table 
 i eventually had to get foodstamps to survive 
 i lived in a small town and this was humiliating to say the least 
 the worst part was the little half smile their lawyer would give me at the end of each adjournment 
 one night while trying to glue a toy together for one of the kids a revenge plan presented itself 
 it was time for him to feel what it was like to have his life interrupted 
 the courthouse had a several story parking structure that everyone used 
 it offered a number of good hiding places 
 this was before there were security cameras everywhere 
 i took a small pin cut the head off of it so it was just a small straight <unk> with a pointed end and then super glued it to his door <unk> 
 i did stay to watch and sure enough he jammed his hand into the pin while opening his car door 
 the pin fell to the ground – he never saw it 
 by the way he jumped and screamed i’m guessing he thought it was a <unk> on his <unk> 
 i then waited a few hours and then used a pay phone this was years ago at the court house and dialed his office 
 when he came to the phone i asked him how his hand was i <unk> my voice 
 he immediately made the connection 
 i then told him that he had <unk> himself on a <unk> needle that came from an aids patient 
 his scream was most satisfying 
 the whole call lasted less than a minute 
 i did see him in court a few months later and he looked like hell 
 i wasn’t in a loop to learn how he reacted but i assume he <unk> a lot of aids testing before he was satisfied that he didn’t have the disease 
 i’m guessing hoping that he did have a certain stigma during that time 
 in <unk> i was a fine and applied arts major in college 
 basically i was a guy who loved to paint 
 as such i took a job at a major retail art 's and craft 's chain 
 we had a great group of people that managed every department 
 i would work 20-30 hours per week 
 it was primarily for the discounts i would receive on art supplies 
 in fact when old oil colors had expired '' i would receive both the <unk> price and the employee discount 
 life was great 
 pay was good and everyone got along 
 i had worked there for 9 months and everything seemed to being going well until they hired a new person as their assistant store manager 
 her name was unique this only matters because of future background checks but as soon as she was hired she decided to change things about the store 
 i am a person who is liberal in many <unk> particularly when it comes to fair and equal treatment of all people 
 but she did not see it in that manner 
 she was a very militant lesbian 
 at first we seemed to be friends 
 she asked me what i thought about her lifestyle and my response is the same as it is today ... everyone deserves the same treatment and opportunities 
 i do n't care what you do ... i am neutral in all matters 
 that was until she started firing people and getting her friends jobs in this store 
 she had a friend whom wanted a job in the framing dept ... well she went out of her way to fire a person 
 she was targeting people so she could hire her friends 
 she ever fired the <unk> '' gay guy from his position in the <unk> dept so her friend could get a job there 
 she was just a terrible person with a chip on her shoulder 
 things came to a head when she made false accusations against both the manager and the other assistant manager for harassment against her gender preference 
 she had her friends back her claims up 
 i knew that these 2 individuals made no such claim as one was a pretty good friend 
 i knew i was next ... and low and behold that day came 
 what she failed to acknowledge was that i had been watching and waiting prior to my termination 
 they became to comfortable in their positions 
 she and her friends would love to visit this local karaoke bar after work and sing 
 what she failed to understand was that i knew they also loved to go around the back of this bar and smoke pot between their sets 
 so i simply called the cops and told them that these people are smoking pot behind this bar 
 needless to say she was arrested as were her cohorts 
 apparently as per the <unk> <unk> they were holding 
 tldr do n't fire people and replace them with your own friends if you are going to do illegal activities and make them know to the staff that hates you so i’ve been only lurking reddit for a while but now that i’ve discovered this subreddit i’m <unk> because i have a story for you 
 this is by far the worst i’ve ever done to someone else but i don’t actually regret it 
 heads up this story is long 
 it happened when i was in my third and last year in a religious high school 
 the boy in question was in my class and even though he was friend of my friends i’d never actually interacted with him 
 semester started and he’s nice and friendly with me so i was too 
 then he stepped it up acting the gentleman offering to carry my things from my locker to our classroom even if those things were just a couple of notebooks 
 this is when it actually started 
 i’ve always been a private <unk> girl 
 i dislike it when people offer to do things for me that i’m perfectly capable of doing myself 
 so after a whole day of offering to carry my books at the start of every class i told him something like how i appreciated his wanting to help but that i was most comfortable carrying my things myself and if i ever needed help i would ask him 
 i was raised polite and i will die polite 
 so he backed <unk> one day 
 the next he kept at it and the next and the next 
 every 
 single 
 class 
 for almost the whole semester 
 it didn’t matter how many times i said no thanks 
 or how many times i asked him to stop 
 or how by <unk> i resorted to outright ignore his offers 
 he would sit close to me and take my things without my permission 
 sometimes he would forcefully take my books from my hands to carry them himself 
 he would poke me to find my <unk> spots and when he found out i don’t have them he’d poke me harder like he thought the <unk> spots were deeper and he’d find them if he kept digging and that was actually painful 
 he would ambush me everywhere and he would loudly <unk> i was lesbian with my bff this was a very religious school with textbooks on how <unk> was a big sin so you can imagine how well it would have gone if direction got wind of that 
 he was vulgar and seriously nasty 
 i’m sure he stalked me at least once 
 some people thought he liked me 
 now i’m also very non-confrontational 
 and i have very high levels of patience and tolerance that one professional told me aren’t exactly healthy 
 so didn’t tell him to fuck off just kept politely asking to stop but he just didn’t the school wasn’t helpful at all he was 18 and i was about to be as well so we’re adults who should had been able to talk this out with <unk> 
 when that semester ended and the very last one of high school started i was dreading my first encounter with him 
 it went on like usual but to my own surprise i was starting to discover i may actually had a <unk> supply of patience 
 i asked again for him to stop and still he refused to listen 
 i can’t remember if it was by the start of the semester or halfway but i do remember we were changing classrooms to take a class called values it was like ethics and <unk> rolled into one it <unk> you how to be a better person which given what happened i find hilarious 
 it was very early so the teacher and most of my classmates hadn’t arrived yet 
 the seats were arranged in a huge circle and he sat next to me seats were those <unk> <unk> fyi 
 he immediately took my mechanical pencil and i snapped it back 
 he took my notebook and held it out my reach then he fucking poked my side like he wanted to stab me with his fingers and that’s it 
 that’s the moment when my patience ran out and complete outrageous fury <unk> me 
 i saw black like my vision just went <unk> on him and all i could see was the damn smug smirk he gave me every time i asked him to stop 
 over six fucking months of having to stand his creepy bully self 
 i’d had enough of that motherfucker 
 he lowered my notebook when he poked me and his hand was splayed on top of it over his desk 
 i still had my mechanical pencil in my hand grabbed so tightly it was almost shaking 
 i was so angry i didn’t care about consequences 
 i stabbed his hand with my pencil 
 he was in shock didn’t scream didn’t move just stared at me face <unk> open mouthed eyes big and fearful like he was seeing me for the first time and i was something too scary to comprehend 
 i leaned <unk> and just whispered : <unk> 
 me 
 <unk> then i took my pencil my notebook and sat back in my seat all while watching how blood <unk> down his hand 
 mind you the force with which i stabbed him wasn’t that great just enough for the lead <unk> of the pencil to break skin and <unk> the lead between two knuckles 
 nevertheless it was strong and painful enough to send the message i wanted 
 he never again approached me 
 now i’m not sure why he didn’t tell on me 
 be it shame guilt or whatever else i was never called for it even when i’m pretty sure we weren’t alone in the classroom so he could have had witnesses 
 this was ten years ago and i last saw him about six or seven when a common friend <unk> a generation party 
 he came up to me and as greeting he showed me his hand 
 the skin had healed around the lead which he never took out because i could see a tiny black dot between two <unk> story takes place in <unk> united kingdom and is <unk> so apologies in advance 
 i 've had some dumb luck the past 5 years of my work history 
 i am an <unk> type 
 so i applied for a job i had been out of work for 3 years prior due to a hormone condition and depression at company a and got a job as a call <unk> in a telephone answering service 
 over a few years i kept that same shitty job title and pay but was actually more the office manager due to the workload and how much of a distance there was between what my daily work was compared to anyone else 
 so long story short i lost a baby the company owner made a comment in front of me to a client should have kept a hand on her <unk> '' meaning i should have kept a hand on my <unk> and not had <unk> so i walked out without notice and because i was the only one running admin in the place it all stopped and she lost her biggest client 
 : <unk> i landed another job at company b as an admin assistant 
 it should have been easy something low key to keep me financially until i could recover from losing the baby 
 also at this time i had moved house and was saving for my wedding which was made known to the owner of the company 
 that is why i applied for the lower ranked and paid position 
 within the year i was running an entire central production unit for a chain of cafe 's and <unk> 's 
 still on low pay and shitty admin assistant job title 
 you see a <unk> theme here 
 as i was about to demand a pay rise and proper job title for the work i did the owner puts the whole company into administration and cuts everyone 's hours 
 i sucked it up to keep the place going 
 i worked hard and got the cpu into profit 
 owner says everyone needs to slash their hours more because other <unk> are losing money 
 i refuse to cut mine 
 im already down to the bone financially 
 he agrees to have a meeting about it but instead <unk> off on holiday 
 i hear back from company c re a role i applied for as an admin learn i have a new job to go to so walk out the very next day 
 the place is still in administration many years later with massive job <unk> and they closed half their locations 
 turns out my work was the only thing keeping the cpu open and when i left they had to close it down because no one else knew how to run it and they failed a <unk> inspection too 
 company c takes us to the true prorevenge 
 at first things are amazing 
 great hours pay and im treated really well 
 i start to put the past behind me thinking the way things went at the last two companies must be a fluke 
 company c rewards my hard work with a pay rise and better job title after 3 months 
 but then they start to take me for granted ... after 4 months of being there i am moved to the sister company which is the installation branch fitting insulation under government grants to residential homes 
 i am to run the installation and warehouse operations with a small admin team and it will be temporary with my reward being a move to office manager when the current manager angela goes on maternity leave 
 on this basis i accept 
 the idea was when angela comes back she will be moved to oversee another dept so while i am running installations i have a nervous angela to <unk> as she is still my manager in theory and wants me to use her crappy basic spreadsheets so she can feel like she is still in control but i also have 3 <unk> swishy stupid and sly constantly coming in and <unk> each other over what they want and targets etc 
 i <unk> making everyone happy meet the targets and get <unk> and procedures in place - oh and i am still doing tasks from my old role as they do n't have anyone else to take care of that 
 i have issues with the team they hired to do admin under me 
 lazy slutty and shy 
 lazy plays on facebook all day slutty <unk> and <unk> all day and shy is quietly handling way too much but too afraid to speak up 
 so i report the team issues and they get pulled into a meeting 
 remember i am a senior administrator not a manager 
 i get brought in afterwards and director stupid <unk> that they are all perfectly fine and competent and its my fault they are n't doing their jobs 
 i suck it up thinking he may be right and try to work on my management style 
 nothing changes 
 in fact it takes director sly coming in on a day when all 3 are off and i am doing all of their jobs by myself for the bosses to notice how little my team actually have to do 
 but again why do anything about it when <unk> can take it on and cover it all as well 
 nothing is done about the 3 <unk> and my workload continues as is 
 shortly thereafter it is announced the new office manager will be claire ... i am livid but think maybe i am going to be made the official installations manager as this is <unk> at by other managers 
 i have at this point only been in the new role 2 months 
 then the stress got to me and i was off ill for a week 
 while i was off everything fell apart my admin staff stopped doing any work at all and some installs were reported as complete when they had n't been 
 so director swishy <unk> in and orders the whole place be audited 
 he <unk> me and <unk> me to look for another job 
 he tasks the audit to claire 
 claire is 24 years old and this is her second job ever 
 claire looks and acts much older than she actually is so you get <unk> into thinking she is better than she is 
 she is also the type to blame others for her mistakes or great at hiding them 
 she gets to the root of those installs being declared complete when they were n't as one <unk> <unk> his paperwork 
 he would have brought that in and given it to slutty who should have then <unk> the job and put the paperwork back out 
 but of course she did n't because she was n't doing any work while i was off 
 so the bosses ca n't pin the blame on me before i went off sick i was supposed to be off for 1 day and had left a detailed list of everyone 's daily job and tasks so other managers would know who does what and decide to pull me back into my old role and put lazy slutty and shy into lesser admin roles 
 this means no promotion for me 
 they then hire a new admin team and make one of them the fucking manager she has no experience and <unk> with the <unk> 
 but wait it gets better 
 2-3 months later i am now working directly under director sly and the operations manager lizard king 
 in fact i am doing all of lizard king 's work and taking abuse and bullying from him as no one else can stand working near him 
 i am doing jobs well <unk> my <unk> like <unk> for work and running the entire <unk> 
 i am in effect the assistant <unk> manager 
 no pay rise or job title though 
 now we get to the end 
 i effectively hold the keys to the kingdom 
 there is no part of the business i do n't know and have n't run or had a part in getting up and <unk> 
 i am <unk> upon for almost everything 
 they call me the <unk> of the office 
 at this point i 've been with company c less than 2 years 
 claire is still called the office manager but all she does is oversee a small team who submit completed installs to the <unk> for payment 
 she does n't know anything actually office manager related 
 i have a run in with director stupid 
 he allowed lizard king to bully his assistant so she quit 
 i am forced despite protesting to also take on her work which is wiping his dumb ass 
 he calls me after hours with stupid comments like did you <unk> x and call y after i emailed him to say i had before i left work and verbally told him i had emailed him 
 i arrange a really important compliance audit to allow time to get it done right and he calls them behind my back and <unk> cutting the time i have to do the work in half 
 this compliance audit costs us thousands and is really important to get more work 
 its all too much and i get sicker and sicker 
 finally i decide i will quit 
 i tell the office <unk> i am thinking of quitting knowing word will spread and it does 
 director swishy takes me aside and begs me not to leave he gives me a paid week off and says to come in the monday after for a talk 
 i think things are finally changing so agree 
 except that i notice on the sunday that director swishy posts on facebook that he is hungover and taking monday off 
 so i do n't go back 
 i get a phone call late on tuesday and director swishy is literally begging me to come in 
 i tell him everything and that he does n't even pay me enough for what i do 
 he starts to cry 
 his tears are like fucking bliss to me 
 cry fucker 
 i tell him no way i am done and he wo n't see me again 
 i then call up company d - who is their biggest rival and most hated nemesis 
 company d is owned by two former staff of company c who were treated like shit walked out and started up their own version of company c. they give me a job 
 i then remember i never signed a non compete so i call up company c 's best sales staff and offer them jobs 
 i get their top man to come join us and he brings a handful of install leads with him customers he was screwed out of commission on 
 company c panic when they realise and try to set the lawyers on us 
 there is no case 
 they then call us and <unk> us visit the office etc 
 we do n't back down 
 they actually think we have their entire lead database we do n't and are shitting bricks 
 finally i get a phone call from director swishy 
 again he is crying 
 please do n't ruin us 
 i know you are behind this 
 please just destroy the database and this will all be over '' 
 bla bla i let him think i am thinking about it 
 eventually company c is forced to buy a new database and only then do i call him back and tell him that we only ever had 5 or 6 leads he could describe as being on his database but those leads came to us through a third party and we had n't gotten any sales so <unk> them 
 company c have since closed the sister installations company down most of the staff were made redundant for unrelated reasons not my doing and are now a company of 3 directors 3 managers and 1 admin from 80+ staff 
 claire has been given all of my work and complains constantly as well as a <unk> 
 angela got fired for being useless lizard king has had his hours and pay cut and claire is going to be forced out soon as the owners are talking about selling up 
 i get all the updates from the company accountant whom they bullied so bad she lost her hair and is now working for me part time 
 & gt revenge : making your former bosses pay thousands for something they do n't need lose another <unk> on compliance <unk> they failed when you walked out and make at least one of them cry 
 twice 
 company d so far are treating me like a queen 
 if shit turns sour here it wo n't matter 
 i have the keys to the kingdom again ... tl dr 3 <unk> companies i worked for treated me badly and took me for granted 
 i walk out and leave them in shit 
 last company took a hit for over <unk> and made the owner cry 
 twice 
 so as a quick background for those who do n't know mtg magic the gathering is a competitive card game with cards <unk> from $ <unk> to $ <unk> in price 
 at our local game store there 's a guy who 's known for being pretty dodgy with trades he always has the latest cards but if you want to get them you kind of have to throw a few extra dollars worth of cards towards them regardless of whether or not your cards are worth <unk> harder to find or such 
 so my partner sees that said person has 4 <unk> '' very powerful cards that essentially give you 2 <unk> of <unk> what you use to cast cards without any downside i.e pretty much better than every other land out there to date 
 they are worth at the time $ 100 in mint condition and are pretty hard to find so of course she calls me excitedly asking if we can get them or not to which i say sure 
 a week goes by and we begin to notice that the cards seem pretty different to the average card visibly no difference but after some testing it becomes <unk> that they are fake 
 after parting with $ 400 for the cards you can understand why the both of us were upset that we 'd paid $ 400 for something worthless unusable and reputation damaging if we continued in trading them off 
 after confronting said player about these cards they inform us that they did n't know they were fake '' 
 so he 's not going to refund us the money even if we gave him back the cards 
 our shop owner says that he ca n't do much to stop this and suggest we come to a deal between ourselves which the guy is 100 percent opposed to 
 this made me angry 
 when he goes to the bathroom i check his folder and notice he has many high value trade cards that seem to have also been faked and he has been trying to trade for cash real cards or various other things from people in the shop 
 so i picked the folder up passed it to the store owner who knows magic like the back of his hand who <unk> that they are fake indeed but he has to witness the guy trying to sell them 
 the guy comes out the toilet and we pass the folder to him stating we thought someone had left it there and we were just worried as he almost caught us he pays himself into a high level tournament that cost $ 40 to enter in the <unk> and proceeds to get to the final round with almost $ 1000 in prizes this is a big deal 
 so the owner and i come over to the table and request to deck check '' the deck he 's playing with making sure his deck is within the rules standard practice in the tournament 
 he passes the deck over and the owner pulls out each fake card in his office in front of myself stamps them with a large stamp with the word proxy '' aka not a real card 
 in giant red ink hands the deck back <unk> the asshat from the tournament as well as requesting that he does not trade here until he trades non proxy '' <unk> cards 
 the guy flips his shit demands his money back demands proof which the store owner then gives 
 followed by general swearing and name calling and the like 
 the store owner looks him in the face tells him bluntly that he is calling the cops for fraudulent trading or something like that 
 and unless he hands his folder over with the fake cards he will see him in court and make sure he does n't play in any of the other stores around the state 
 the guy red faces starts screaming to which the store owner plain and simply picks him up and moves him outside he 's a 6 '' 8 fairly built guy surprisingly he <unk> the person from coming to his store and says that if he does n't leave immediately he will end up with a night in a prison cell 
 i go up take the guys trade folder and sell the very few real and good cards in his folder for about $ 500 and leave the <unk> in a bin with the folder in question with the guy not to be seen again 
 i got my money back and after hearing a bit of news from a store owner close by i found out that the guy had tried the same crap in another store and was immediately caught out due to our store owner spreading word of him 
 has n't been seen since 
 owner also offered a free tournament with same prize for all <unk> in the tournament scumbag got to finals in so everybody won : tldr : magic card <unk> scams $ 400 of cards gets caught due to my self and good store owner gets kicked out and banned without being able to grab his folder get about $ 500 from the remains and his expensive fake collection <unk> 
 also kicked out from an expensive tournament final round very publicly and <unk> 
 <unk> posted this in pettyrevenge was told to post this here so here we go : ** this is a story from when i was in 8th grade 
 to provide a little background i was a nerdy kid of less than 100 pounds with no muscle whatsoever 
 i was frequently bullied because of this usually just verbal but sometimes more 
 this kid named a realized that he could take my lunch and i could n't do anything about it so that went on for a few days 
 he had a particular taste for packaged meat <unk> this is important 
 after the second time he stole my lunch and i went hungry as a result i was fed up 
 i went home took a piece of beef jerky and soaked it in dave 's insanity sauce for <unk> hours 
 after <unk> the meat holy shit was it spicy and i have a high tolerance for heat i brought it in to school 
 i told my friends and classmates what was about to go down so that they could watch it happen 
 well what do you know a came around and snatched the beef jerky out of my hands at lunch 
 i hardly complained just told him it was a special <unk> of mine 
 he took a giant bite and started to talk about how spicy it was me telling him that was how i like it and with a big shit-eating grin on my face 
 fast forward to 10 minutes later and a was visibly sweating face red swearing loudly about the beef jerky he was still <unk> on so he did n't look like a bitch in front of his friends 
 he snatched my fruit snacks and <unk> ate them in front of me and then i knew i had to end this once and for all so i tried to think of a plan 
 meanwhile a spent the rest of lunch blocking anyone else from using the water fountain in order to wash the heat from his mouth 
 on the way back from lunch a still swearing at me i told him i knew a little trick to get the heat out 
 i told him to just <unk> the corners of his eyes right near the tear <unk> ... ... a spent an entire period crying into the water fountain to wash the spice out of his eyes 
 he never stole my lunch again 
 and neither did anyone <unk> time lurker 2nd time poster 
 my former 'best friend who i will call tim had a crush on me 
 i was in a relationship already with <unk> 
 being the naive teenager i was i did not realise tim had feelings for me we go a house party myself tim andy + friends 
 tim drinks for the first time 
 he creates a scene and starts telling my friends that andy abuses me ... andy has to be taken outside to ensure he does n't go ham on tim 
 i calm andy down and then i take tim into the room we sit on the bed and talk it out 
 he <unk> his love i get a bottle of wine needed it <unk> shit got real 
 i got tipsy ... he started sexually harassing me 
 i sober up freak out and tell andy that tim hit on me 
 tim starts telling everyone that i 'm a lying whore who cheats on her boyfriend if you call being sexually harassed whilst unable to defend yourself cheating then i 'm guilty 
 i lost friends over this 
 tim is extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive so i really do n't blame them for falling for his silver tongue 
 i was humiliated cried and left the party with andy who believed me as he was told by a mutual friend that tim intended to ruin our relationship 
 after the party i stop speaking to tim and most of my friends 
 fast forward a year ... ok so now i explain my revenge : i basically emotionally manipulated my former friend tim 's now best friend 
 this is pretty much a story unto it 's own 
 i found out where tim lived and currently worked 
 i waited for a job opening at tim 's workplace 
 i applied for a role i was <unk> for and was successful 
 i had to leave my job that i was at for over 4 years and also i had to <unk> college in order to take this full time sales job 
 when i saw tim i acted <unk> 
 i took him to lunch and expressed my guilt over what happened that night at the party 
 this is one of the hardest things i 've ever done 
 denying that i was harassed and acting though i was asking for it ... made me sick to my stomach 
 after this i had this fucker right in the palm of my hand 
 we were 'best friends all over again he trusted me entirely 
 i was out for blood and felt hatred toward him the entire time 
 this is important later : over my break i would fake interest in his job and got him to teach me all he knew 
 i got him to train me over my break for a period of over 6 months 
 in the meantime he had bitched about every single one of my co-workers and their dogs ... i wait for him to go on leave just before christmas i convinced him to go then lol and proceed to tell every single co-worker in that department what he had said about them the first day he was gone 
 boss received endless complaints the same day but expressed that he could n't <unk> him due to not being able to hire anyone else before christmas so this is where my 6 month administration and contract training kicks in 
 i demonstrate my skills to my boss and by the days end i take that fuckers job 
 my job was easy to replace as it was entry level sales his was not 
 to avoid a possible shit storm i advised my employer to <unk> tim and to also slightly change the title of my new job so he could n't go to the union and sue etc ... 
 tim calls me up and tells me everything 
 we even met up and i <unk> him 
 he was a mess 
 i told him that i could not believe i was given his position 
 i told him about the slight change of title on the job position too 
 about a week and a half later i stopped showing up to work 
 i told tim i no longer needed the job as i was going to work with a friend 
 i told him i did n't even give my 2 weeks notice and left just before the busy christmas period 
 i acted as though the job was beneath me 
 i acted as though i <unk> n't need the job just to rub salt in his <unk> 
 and oh boy ... did my <unk> attitude work 
 he started drinking heavily stopped <unk> and was pretty much disowned from his family 
 here this dude is <unk> and i carelessly quit 
 just like that 
 naturally he was pissed and so we arranged a meeting at a park with our friends to make up 
 i was going to let him off easy but no ... he hit my friend girl 
 i grabbed him by the <unk> of his shirt threw him down and dumped a large cola with ice on his head 
 i then asked him if he thought it was a coincidence that i started working at the same company 
 i saw him connect the dots dazed shocked <unk> ... i then burned some rubber in the car park and drove away 
 also do n't feel sorry for the company every last one of them was a piece of crap probably why i fit in so well with them : p 
 tldr got harassed took the fuckers job 
 until recently i had a small it consulting business a domain i have had since 1996 and a google apps account using my domain 
 today i use google apps to keep the family together under a common email <unk> and to keep track of all the accounts and subscriptions i <unk> over the years 
 i have a <unk> email definition so all email coming to an <unk> address ends in my mailbox 
 there was always some abuse - a couple of times <unk> used a fake address on my domain as the send from '' address and i ended up with thousands of bounced mail and a few angry complaints 
 i learned to live with the occasional trouble dealing with it when it comes 
 <unk> also helps a lot and this is not a real issue any longer 
 however during the past year or so a bunch of people started using fake emails on my domain for various services and social <unk> 
 for some people this is the ideal way : they can open an <unk> account use it but not be on the mass email lists and <unk> notifications coming from the vendors 
 well in the beginning it was a single <unk> guy and i just filtered him out 
 my <unk> turned out to be a mistake 
 today there are 3 groups that abuse my domain : the <unk> all young women the <unk> who all seem to come from a single <unk> and the malay guys 
 approximately 30 people 
 thanks to them i get dozens of daily <unk> from facebook <unk> skype and apple as well as hundreds of <unk> from the dating services <unk> sites gaming sites and whatever they bought 
 i was getting really pissed off and decided to fight back 
 my first action was 6 months ago against m a <unk> guy whose name was getting <unk> daily invitations to play silly games on facebook 
 all coming into my mailbox 
 i searched my mailbox and found out that he is also registered to <unk> 
 i reset his password and peeked at his files 
 mostly boring stuff <unk> with candles and cakes some travels 
 except for one folder where he keeps his smut collection 
 bingo 
 the guy loves girls with big <unk> and i am ok with that 
 one picture in particular caught my fancy he took a selfie of himself during anal <unk> with a girl whose face i saw in the family pictures 
 step 2 was to <unk> his facebook password and post the shared link 
 the facebook account was closed after less than 48 hours 
 i placed m on a google delete filter 
 action # 2 was a couple of days later : o is a nice <unk> gal in her twenties with a penchant for online dating services 
 she had subscriptions to at least 10 such sites plus paid subscriptions to several horoscope and <unk> readings 
 needless to say dating sites generate <unk> of marketing emails or at least so it seemed to me 
 and i really do n't think highly of people who manage their lives according to the horoscope 
 i am a one trick pony - what worked for m will work for <unk> i reset her password on 2 dating sites and changed her description to read : i like anal sex with older men preferably <unk> and bald 
 i also like dogs 
 big dogs '' 
 for a couple of weeks i would log into her dating accounts just to see urgent messages the <unk> perverts sent her 
 to be honest after the initial hysterical laughter i felt sorry for these guys not the perverts the email <unk> 
 maybe they just got bad advice from someone so i did not pursue additional revenge for a while 
 i am not a natural jerk 
 my domain name is similar enough to that of a hotel reservations web site and when people <unk> and send to me by mistake i usually respond to them and tell them to fix their <unk> 
 fast forward to may this year 
 a <unk> starts to stand out in the crowd 
 m this time a malay guy is a real jerk 
 he is trying to con some people in what looks like a <unk> scheme thank you google translate for letting me understand the email content 
 he made the fatal mistake of mixing business with pleasure and has a facebook account using his fake email 
 well i do n't have sympathy to jerks and to really stupid people who think they are really clever 
 thank you google translate for writing obscenities in malay and thank you facebook for having low default account security measures 
 m posted on his <unk> the following text : saya <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : saya <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 i did n't have that much luck with a s s and r : their facebook accounts are secured and require some security questions but i did change their passwords and locked them out 
 t is another <unk> girl living in <unk> and she uses her fake email as an apple id to buy stuff in itunes 
 this is really stupid of her and this is the highlight of my revenge : last week i erased her iphone via <unk> 
 i am getting 10 daily requests to reset her apple id password : looks like she has stuff in itunes 
 t if you are reading this tell your friends that stealing email accounts is <unk> and wrong 
 tl dr people whom i do n't know abuse email accounts in my domain causing me to receive hundreds of unwanted and spam emails 
 i retaliated by <unk> social media accounts posting on their behalf and locking them out 
 in one case i remotely erased an iphone <unk> to an abuser 
 a few years ago in my mid 20s i was engaged to a guy 
 obviously i thought he was worth it at the time but it turned out i was very wrong 
 my fiance was living with me though he still maintained a studio apartment across town due to his super <unk> parents 
 they were footing the bill for some of the wedding and we decided to keep them <unk> by keeping up the illusion of living separately 
 one day i came home and heard the telltale sounds of people screwing 
 my heart jumped up into my throat then <unk> into my stomach 
 i thought there was no way it could be what i thought that it must be some porn he was watching 
 it did n't sound like it was coming from a speaker though 
 i crept to the bedroom and found him <unk> in the woman who was going to be my <unk> of honor in a few months 
 i wanted to react right then but did n't trust myself in my potential reaction 
 so i left and started to think 
 here 's where the revenge comes in 
 i purchased a camera to hide in the bedroom and record when i was gone 
 if he was dumb enough to have another woman in the bed in my home he 'd done it before and would do it again 
 it was a matter of waiting 
 eventually i caught them and saved the recording to multiple places - physically and virtually 
 one long weekend we were supposed to go visit his family who lived a few hours away 
 i claimed i was sick but insisted he go 
 while he was gone i boxed up everything of his that was at my place which was most of what he owned and brought it to a storage unit about an hour from where we lived in an area that had a couple dozen storage <unk> 
 i then put the key for the storage locker in a <unk> in <unk> storage unit 
 in a town an hour in the opposite direction from the starting point or two hours from where his stuff was stored 
 i paid four months in advance for each in cash 
 i used different names and each location 
 i also ground off any identifying marks on the keys that would let him know what brand locks were used 
 that done i changed the locks on my place and printed a photo of him screwing my former friend in the box with it in case that was n't enough i included a cheap <unk> drive with the video on it 
 i also put a note saying good luck finding your things 
 finding the lock that this key fits is the first step '' 
 as a final burn i sent a copy of the video to everyone we knew 
 including his family 
 after reading this subreddit for three straight hours it 's time 
 my mother is a cunt 
 she <unk> the term <unk> 
 she got child support from my dad for four kids for a grand total of <unk> years and half his 401k 
 i was the youngest kid and got to experience the end of her first and second marriage and all of it 's <unk> 
 the second husband made 100k a year while she did temp jobs throughout their ten year marriage and spent every dime of the child support from my dad on herself and bills '' that she had to take care of 
 she expected my older brother and sister to pay her back for college tuition even though my stepdad paid for them both and all her personal bills 
 i turn 16 and i get my license 
 i am allowed to use one of her three cars since she ca n't afford to get one for me 
 a year goes by and the car 's transmission <unk> goes out 
 so she promises me that she 'll give me half of whatever i can sell the car for in order to buy myself one thinking i 'll barely make $ 1500 
 i end up selling the car for $ 3500 and so i expect her to pay at least $ 1500 
 does n't happen 
 my dad hates her just as much as i do so he tells me that i can decide how i want things to plan out 
 we tell her that there 's a car for $ 1200 being sold where he lives and that if she pays for it he 'll pay for maintenance 
 she ca n't bare to part with that much and says she 'll do $ 1000 
 so we agree and she gives my dad the money and we part ways 
 my dad turns around and hands me the cash saying he already payed for the car which he got for $ 800 and i can keep the money and the car 
 it was well spent on school since she refuses to help pay for college even though i have a job pay my own bills and live on my own with serious health problems 
 fuck the bitch 
 even though it was only $ 1000 it was the best money i 've ever <unk> is a bit of long background but it 's all pertinent 
 my boss was the usual middle management guy let 's call him mmg in an old contracting job 
 tightly wound entirely focused on his subordinates mistakes while trying to flatter upper management 
 i was under him and while most of the office feared him i was less than <unk> with his leadership 
 mmg would often make us complete several versions of the same product just in case management did not like the original product 
 no one ever saw these ghost product versions except once when he took a part of one and passed it off as his own work 
 added to the fact that he provided zero encouragement and had the humor of a block of wood 
 yet when upper management was around he was a completely different person 
 <unk> and <unk> he would assume a false <unk> with the staff 
 when upper management left he could n't care less 
 while we did n't hate him we did greatly dislike him 
 one instance made me want revenge 
 i strongly argued against a <unk> product feature that mmg just dreamed up '' 
 mmg argued equally strongly for it 
 it was more heated than i usually get 
 when upper management <unk> the feature mmg blamed the team for it and actually called me in to say that i should have been more clear in my objections '' 
 and he was a bit of a screamer 
 i was angry but ... i 'm not a got ta get revenge guy 
 so i bided my time and hoped an opportunity would <unk> 
 one day the entire company has a retreat 
 everyone is meeting with different departments and the atmosphere is chill 
 over coronas and <unk> <unk> i meet boss dude bd 
 bd is a family member of the owner but perfectly competent in his own right as upper management 
 bd headed a different department than mine so there was no office pressure 
 we both had similar interests and became fast friends 
 one <unk> that bd and myself shared was our <unk> of pranks 
 i told him old office pranks i used to pull before mmg and he loved it 
 but we never talked shop and i never raised the subject of mmg nor would i have even if given the opportunity 
 it was purely a <unk> relationship 
 fast forward to several months later 
 in the <unk> bd asked me to assist in some pranks in his department since i was an unknown there 
 harmless stuff mostly like pretending i was accounting and footing someone with a fake bill on their company card 
 or helping to post-it someone 's desk 
 it was a nice <unk> from my office of <unk> and was building my prank cred at the same time 
 i was tempted to use my influence to prank mmg but it never felt right and i thought it would end up being a mistake <unk> on me 
 but i know there is opportunity somewhere 
 then one day i receive an email titled * '' significant issue '' * from some senior guy i do n't know 
 my mouth drops when i see the photo attached in the email 
 it 's a actual picture of one of our product that our team works on with a close up of the instructions that i personally write and check 
 it reads normally until the end that says : -- - <unk> are additional important steps for proper operation of this product 
 however i am too drunk to write anymore so just agree to be careful ok 
 * -- - my heart stops as the email says this went out <unk> in the final production despite your check 
 we will now have to recall all the affected units 
 care to explain '' 
 i scramble to locate the file for the this product to check all its <unk> before i try to calculate the cost of this <unk> 
 as the instructions are usually <unk> i could imagine someone adding this into the product and it missing all subsequent checks 
 the weight of the world falls off my shoulders to see that our office put out the correct instructions without that addition 
 i have to take a moment to catch my breath before realizing the issue 
 i chuckle and start looking around 
 sure enough bd is outside the plate glass looking in and laughing his ass off 
 we go have coffee and bd explains how he <unk> the design department to make a <unk> of a fake instruction label to prank me with 
 i 'm a good sport though admittedly slightly miffed and compliment him on a solid <unk> inducing prank 
 bd is clearly proud of his efforts 
 a lightbulb goes on 
 i say wow i almost died when i saw that 
 i bet my boss mmg would have the same reaction '' 
 i <unk> and flatter saying how it would be nice to <unk> the prank 
 eventually bd is supportive of trying it out on mmg even though bd does n't personally know mmg 
 it 's revenge time 
 so ... <unk> bd stands outside the office i write an email to mmg that is a <unk> of bd 's prank email to me : -- - <unk> let me first state that i am committed to solving this issue and you have my complete attention as well as my apologies in regards to this attached picture 
 while i acknowledge this <unk> might cost our department insert large $ $ $ $ figure i think we can <unk> these costs 
 for the sake of our team in the near term i ask you to keep between you me senior guy who sent the first email until the team can devise a way forward 
 * -- - i went to an air show as a boy 
 loved it especially as those <unk> would scream as they flew past 
 well a few minutes after i hit send on the email and and mmg <unk> in his office and that scream increases as it flies toward my cube 
 the whole office <unk> 
 mmg 's face is <unk> and for a second i wonder if he is going to pass out while screaming are you a <unk> idiot 
 mmg leans on my desk and starts puffing 
 i am suddenly afraid for mmg 's health and start telling him to calm down 
 this seems to <unk> him more as he says calm down 
 are you <unk> serious you add horrible insults '' 
 he starts just going off about how we can do this to him 
 finally he takes the first thing on my desk some instant coffee packet and throws it against the wall 
 this <unk> bd to come rushing in the room to ask mmg to calm down 
 mmg apparently knows bd and starts <unk> about how i started a crisis -- basically trying to put distance between me and him -- and gaining some sense asked me and bd to come to his office 
 well the meeting was short for me as bd explained how the email was not only a joke but bd 's joke 
 after mmg calmed down mmg tried to laugh off his behavior 
 i apologized <unk> with mmg that the email shocked me too '' 
 however i knew the damage was done 
 at this point bd asked me to leave and bd and mmg had a short unknown discussion 
 after a few weeks mmg was transferred and i think he eventually quit not fired 
 bd cooled it on the pranks but afterwards seemed to be <unk> how the prank magically revealed a management problem 
 i was a pretty fucked up kid and to be blunt it showed 
 had a rich boy pick on me in high school on a regular basis 
 a bit of violence lots of intimidation the whole dance of doing everything out of view of teachers and a school system that <unk> <unk> targeting of weird kids and me naive enough to believe that the system gave a shit about me 
 standard high school bullshit i suppose 
 i figured out where he lived and dumped a bottle of stupidly hot sauce da bomb final solution 
 into his pool 
 as expected even diluted significantly the <unk> <unk> of him and his family were not terribly happy 
 found out they <unk> the pool without washing the walls spent a few hundred on <unk> it - and enough remained on the walls to force them to drain it again wash and refill : i expected retaliation and kind of even hoped that i 'd get the shit kicked out of me but but <unk> happened and all the bullies across the country decided to <unk> their <unk> for a few months 
 not mine but my brother 's story 
 he was driving across the city to a friend 's place 
 he was in a lane that was ending soon so flips on his turn signal checks over the shoulder and in the mirror sees a fellow a good distance back with plenty of room to spare and moves over 
 well the other fellow did n't much care for that as he 'd been speeding probably <unk> over like a typical bmw my car is <unk> fastest '' owner and as a result had to slow down to match my brother 's 10 over 
 now it was n't close or anything guy had plenty of time and room but he got right up on my brother 's tail and was flashing his lights and honking his horn 
 so there 's a red light up ahead couple cars stopped in front of my brother but the other lane is open 
 asshole jumps into the other lane but instead of pulling up to the stop line he stops next to my brother and does the roll down your window '' <unk> motion 
 my brother does guy starts yelling and cussing about how my brother nearly caused a massive <unk> 
 he just starts laughing at the asshole and says you had plenty of room sorry you had to slow down to only ten over '' 
 super polite and all 
 guy gets pissed rolls forward and peels out when the light turns green 
 a bit further down the road turns a bit then <unk> a hill 
 now the cars in front of my brother had exited off so it 's just him and the asshole who 's a good bit ahead 
 my brother drives this road regularly and knows the police like to hide just over the hill and our city was in the middle of what they call a big ticket event '' where cops all put in <unk> effort to set up speed <unk> and catch <unk> 
 so the asshole slows significantly for the turn and my brother having a good idea of his and his vehicle 's limits as well as <unk> with the road does n't slow at all and blows past the asshole <unk> through making sure to smile and wave as he goes by 
 asshole is bound and determined to show him up and prove how fast his car is so he lays into the throttle and by my brother 's <unk> is doing more than double the 50 km/h speed limit when he <unk> the hill 
 sure enough there are about six cop cars parked along with a couple <unk> and my brother sees the cop standing with the radar gun walk out point at the asshole and point to the <unk> 
 last thing he sees in the rearview is guy on the side of the road 
 just some idle speculation but around here i 'm told that the penalty for going double the limit is automatic license suspension court date and vehicle is impounded 
 i 'd bet dollars to <unk> his <unk> base <unk> was <unk> in the impound lot for at least a day or two and he 's probably taking the bus to <unk> dr : got violent drug dealers arrested after shooting my tv via gas bombs 
 somebody at /r/pettyrevenge told me to post this here so here you go 
 after my second year in college a friend and i moved in with another friend 
 he was renting a 3 bedroom house in a lower income area so it was pretty cheap 
 it was fairly close to the university campus and as all three of us were attending we were able to work it out where it would be a whole lot cheaper living there than on campus 
 the neighborhood itself was n't bad at all 
 it was mostly other kids elderly folks and a few others here and there 
 everyone in the neighborhood was pretty relax and chill except for our fucking neighbors 
 we 'll call them <unk> and jesse 
 now <unk> and jesse were brothers and <unk> of sorts 
 they ran a small in-home business selling product in niche market that required very little advertisement 
 they were meth cooks and dealers 
 obnoxious loud violent drug dealers 
 everyone hated them but nobody would say anything about it due to the constant threats they would make while <unk> out from there front yard 
 we pretty much fell in line at first 
 they would blast music and porn from there house from 7am until 7am 
 we 'd hear screaming matches at there house that became full blown fights on their lawn 
 huge fucking parties that would go on for days 
 and to our <unk> we ignored it all 
 well up arrives march and my income tax comes in i only get about $ 500 but <unk> that 's my $ 500 dollars and i 'm gon na fucking buy something for me 
 everything has gone to college and bills and i want to <unk> 
 i go out and buy a <unk> '' <unk> tv 
 it 's a <unk> but it 's the first <unk> i 've ever had 
 my friends and i set it up and oh boy did we have fun that week 
 and only that week for that 's as long as i had it 
 the meth bros decide they 're gon na shoot their bb gun at whatever the fuck they can see 
 at birds bushes <unk> and especially windows 
 well one little bb decided to go straight through my window and hit my tv cracking it while i was playing some <unk> 
 my face dropped and i heard laughing 
 which then immediately turned to death threats if i called the cops 
 now i know they had real guns 
 they had no issue showing them to anyone who looked at them 
 my friends and i were all disappointed at the turn of events 
 and both of them had submitted to not doing anything about it 
 but <unk> not i. the one time i purchased me a bit of joy in my life i grew up fairly poor it was taken away from me 
 so i plotted 
 and i plotted 
 and i plotted some more 
 and an evil plot i did accomplish 
 i saved up every gatorade bottle i purchased for about 3 weeks 
 and every other day i would go to a different store and purchase pool cleaning tablets and rubbing alcohol at a different one all with cash of course 
 now some of you might see what 's going 
 and you 'd be right 
 i had about 15 bottles saved up 
 and i made some spectacular <unk> gas bombs 
 i waited for a night when both of them were gone 
 it was about three in the morning so virtually everyone was asleep 
 i had prepared the gatorade bottles with the alcohol prior so i started loading the tablets into the bottles and throwing them over the fence 
 since i did n't break down the tablets it took a while for them to go off 
 i was able to get them all over the fence before the first one went boom 
 and boom they went 
 i go back inside and into my room 
 i hear them going off 
 boom 
 boom 
 one of my roommates wakes up and goes what the fuck '' 
 boom 
 he wakes my other roommate his room was closer and there both freaking out 
 boom 
 time to put my game face on 
 i scramble on out of there and react visibly scared 
 boom 
 i look at them and tell them to call the cops 
 boom 
 boom 
 he calls 911 and tells the cops he hears <unk> 
 i go outside and pretend to look like i 'm trying to find out what 's going on 
 boom 
 i tell my friend that it 's coming from next door 
 boom 
 he tells me that the cops have already been sent to the area by a previous caller 
 boom 
 boom 
 i tell him there 's a bunch of smoke coming from outside 
 boom 
 they tell us to stay inside 
 boom 
 the last one goes off 
 we close the doors and watch the <unk> unfold 
 right before the cops come the <unk> show up freaking out 
 right as they go inside about 3 cop cars show up and go through the front door 
 the officers haul them away and we go outside 
 they question us we tell them what we know 
 as far as the <unk> gas is concerned 
 it has already wafted into the atmosphere 
 they came back a couple days later and asked us questions specifically about the brothers 
 we told them what we heard about them and how they acted what they did 
 the officer left and that was the last time i talked about it 
 nobody knows about what i did but me 
 and it was the happiest we 've been in a long time 
 the last i heard about them they were doing hard time for their drug ring being in possession of illegal <unk> and human <unk> <unk> 
 edit : <unk> long and written by a potato with shitty <unk> so this happened during the later stages of the 90 's 
 1998 to be exact but i will not disclose the location or names of the people involved so i can stay compliant with sub rules as well as a <unk> <unk> i was made to sign after i successfully sued and won but more on that later 
 i was working for a business run by what appeared to be a normal mom and pop type 
 after about a month or two of working there it became apparent these mom and pop owner were in fact real shitty assholes 
 constant belittlement ranting raving sessions for the slightest mistake and absolutely cheap to bone when it came to wages 
 at the same time i was working two job due to shitty wages and at my other job there was a union drive happening 
 i was just out of high school back then and did not know anything about <unk> and the people who were organizing this did not <unk> anyone 
 they just threw a card in your face told you to sign it then left 
 i was not actually there for the card signing i was hired just after the cards had been signed and this was still a mystery to management 
 i literally was hired just before the shit hit the fan there 
 where i live and at the time labor laws were set up so <unk> % of the employees working at a business was all that was required to get a hearing before the labor board regarding certification 
 when <unk> % of the signed cards were received at the ministry an application for certification was faxed to the senior management at the location detailing all sorts of legal information i am not sure of all the details 
 i do know that at that precise moment no one could be fired demoted or have their wages changed until after the hearing at the labor board where a decision would be made to accept or reject the application for certification 
 by this point it turned into a lawyer show with lawyers from the union and business <unk> it out 
 this happens the place goes ape shit literally with middle management and union drivers in screaming matches it was fucking chaos 
 but i was not there i was at my other job dealing with bullshit i usually dealt with with the mom and pop operation 
 a month or two goes by and the newly organized business settle downs but there is anger resentment and hate bubbling under the surface 
 lines are being drawn and you did not want to find yourself on the wrong side 
 but me being a fresh faced 18 year old out of high school and not knowing what the fuck was going on chose to side with the friendly manager '' who hired me 
 after all it was him who gave me my shot not the <unk> of union drive and the union <unk> did nothing to <unk> me just threatened me with not wanting to be on the wrong side of the line when the everything was finalized 
 if i have n't lost you yet i want to take a moment to say for the record i am not <unk> 
 i am much older now and time has given me perspective and i do n't always agree with labor but i know a strong labor movement is healthy as well another debate for another time ... well the day comes when the pickets go up and this being a smaller town the fucking media is there as well 
 i left my other mom and pop shitty job and came to work at the newly <unk> business i was recently hired at 
 not knowing what to do i chose to cross the picket line and go to work 
 the results of that were to be placed in a group of socially <unk> after the pickets were down and business resumed 
 meanwhile i continue working both jobs the mom and pop job getting more and more insufferable each day 
 most of the workers at the union job wo n't talk to me and all this bullshit from both sides is really beginning to take its toll on a sensitive dumb as shit 18 year old kid that just wanted to work smoke pot and get laid 
 then i have an idea 
 i am done with the mom and pop job and their fucking bullshit 
 if a union drive can happen at the one place why not here 
 also and i am littering giggling like a little asian girl at this idea 
 why do n't i get the same union that i crossed at my other job to <unk> this place and get back in their good graces again 
 so i call up the guy who lead the original organizing drive and after a three hour session of coffee and note pads 
 he agrees to help me out and the next day i started to hand out cards at the mom and pop business 
 the union business agents i dealt with could not be involved at this point 
 legally the signing of the cards had to be done of everyone 's free will and it had to been brought forth by an employee not a union <unk> they supported me coached me daily on how i should tackle the problems that were <unk> but they would not show up at the business until after the application for certification was officially registered at the ministry 
 they were adamant about this but assured me they would be there guns ready the moment it happened 
 well i got my revenge on these petty power mad mom and pop losers 
 the union drive took its toll on all of us but in the end i could not get enough people to sign and i was fired 
 i called the union business agents and they told me not to worry 
 the drive was dead but they were going to sue my former employer on my behalf 
 what i never told the union was i always knew the union would fail 
 it was a smaller business compared to the place where i had crossed the line 
 the <unk> were way different and i knew the people at this business the mom and pop business really did n't give two shits either way 
 but this was a way to legally get back at the owners of the mom and pop and clean my reputation with the union at the same time 
 this was a small town and even know i was a dumb 18 year old i knew this was the kind of thing that would follow me around for ever 
 i wanted to be on the right side of the union if i ever needed them in the future 
 so the union sued them and won 
 i got a small settlement out of it not much money more satisfaction and i <unk> by rep with the union which helped me out many later 
 tldr got treated like shit and cross a picket line figured out a way to get back at the people who treated me like shit and regain my rep with the union who 's line crossed 
 *edit* for spelling on to the story i 'll try and keep it short 
 around <unk> today i received a call from a collections agency i 'd been seeing this number pop up random times everyday 
 so i decided to answer the phone 
 collections asshole ca from here on got short with me when i requested detailed information and then hung up on me when i asked for his full name 
 cue the *you do n't call me wanting money with no explanation and then hang up on me when i start questioning your claims to my money 
 so i called back took 4 calls before i got a hold of a supervisor 
 i finally managed to pry the info out of the supervisor and find out this collection is for a hospital bill i do n't even owe 
 argument ensues with me telling him i 'm refusing to lay $ <unk> for a hospital visit i never even had been to 
 he keeps threatening me with small claims and yada yada but i managed to get the company address a po box in buffalo ny and the number they were calling from was <unk> through nc 
 i looked around and could n't find an actual company listed under the po box or anything related to the phone number 
 nothing no company name no physical address for the office they 're calling from i know they are n't all working from a po box obviously 
 so i get suspicious and call up my attorney with the info i 've found 
 he informs me he 's going to have a look and call me back 
 around 3pm he calls to inform me that this collections '' agency buy outdated alright 
 small midwestern <unk> town '' bar 
 a couple of friends and i stopped in to have a drink and watch some live music 
 one of my friends who we call fat paul in the most <unk> way ever you 'd just have to be there sits down on a wrought iron bench outside the place in front of a big glass window 
 well fat paul '' sat down a little too hard in the seat and it taps the window behind it a little too hard ... ... causing the window which is about oh 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide to shatter and drop out of the frame all over the patio 
 on the other side of this window was a large liquor cabinet and the music was loud inside so nobody noticed 
 while we were sitting there staring <unk> at each other going what the fuck do we do 
 this ... ... extremely drunk <unk> fed midwest bar fly comes <unk> out cigarette in hand 
 the woman is the total stereotype that you 're imagining - too much makeup and <unk> old <unk> <unk> <unk> etc 
 sounded like freakin tom waits when she talked 
 and she had an incredibly nasty maybe even <unk> attitude to boot 
 she comes over and asks for a lighter never noticing the window and starts making passes at us all and trying to get us to buy her a drink 
 after a few more cigarettes the <unk> started getting old and after about the fifth time of her grabbing ahold of my arm and trying to pull me into the bar i say look dude 
 stop fucking pulling on me jesus christ i 'm out here trying to smoke '' 
 this causes a white trash nuclear meltdown 
 this drunken <unk> <unk> caricature starts screaming and calling us all motherfuckers '' and yelling at us to get the fuck out of my bar '' 
 something about this shrill <unk> ranting must have pierced the <unk> better than the shattered window because the bouncer comes outside pretty quickly 
 when he asks us what is going on the woman starts to say something and my buddy fat paul cuts her off and tells the bouncer : i dunno man she came out here drunk as fuck and screaming and yelling and then she bashed out that window right there '' 
 dude totally believed us called the cops and everything 
 we went ahead and split at that point but he was pretty intent on keeping the woman there 
 i always like to imagine she was arrested 
 bitch 
 <unk> back in the early days of high school i used to play a lot of xbox live and i 'd usually play together with my friends whom i knew in real life and one guy who we only knew through the internet but were pretty good friends with anyways 
 at first i had no problem with any of these people but after a while i could n't help but notice how much more often that a couple of them would generally just single me out and act <unk> towards me always trying to make me look stupid or an asshole and always trying to turn the group against me 
 they mostly did this because they wanted to look cool in front of the rest of the group and thought of me as an easy target for some reason 
 one was this kid i knew in real life but was n't really friends with andy and the other was the kid who we only knew online dave 
 for some reason these two were really good friends though probably because they were too insecure for real life friends 
 after a while of silently taking their bullshit one day i finally decided i 'd had enough and it was time to strike back 
 the thing about andy was that he was a compulsive liar 
 like seriously lied about the most mundane shit and would never ever admit that he was lying despite how blatantly obvious it was 
 i think part of the reason why he did n't like me is because i would always call him out on his pathetic lies 
 now andy had a particular lie that he always clung to which was that he had a girlfriend but that the reason we never met her was because she lived in new zealand and they we 're in a long distance relationship although she did n't have a phone and that they only talked through the internet 
 it was obvious that he was lying because he could never keep his story straight and the excuses he would make when you really had him backed into a corner were just straight up laughable 
 he even went as far as to make a fake facebook account for her with a picture he took from the internet and only had literally two facebook friends andy and dave 
 eventually i pressured him enough about it that one day he claimed that he and his <unk> girlfriend had broken up '' and that i could stop harassing him about it 
 now keep in mind that andy would never admit his lies not even to his best friend dave who for some inexplicable reason was too dumb to realize he was a compulsive liar 
 one of the reasons dave was convinced that she existed was because he talked to her '' on facebook a few times and hit it off pretty well 
 when i learned this i immediately realized my opportunity and from another friend of ours i happened to get my hands on dave 's phone number and this is where the fun really began 
 i sent him a text message letting him know that it was <unk> the name of andy 's supposed ex-girlfriend and that her father had finally let her get a cell phone 
 after a bit of back of forth <unk> texting and hitting it off '' we developed a romantic relationship and we 'd text message all the time and tell each other our secrets mine were made up of course and he 'd tell me all sorts of shit fully believing that we had a serious thing going on 
 and of course andy was totally cool with it '' because even though he had no clue who the fuck dave was really talking to he simply could not admit that she did n't exist so he just had no choice but to go along with it too which was hilarious 
 after a while i knew so much intimate shit about this kid and he really opened up and trusted me 
 i even sent him dirty pics '' which was really just forearm by my elbow folded to look like a pussy which he really *really* enjoyed if you know what i mean 
 i almost requested something from him to blackmail him with but realized that would open up a whole other can of legal trouble and i left it alone 
 so after about a month of this while quietly taking their abuse over xbox i finally decided i had enough 
 one day they particularly got on my nerves so in the xbox party chat in front of every one of our friends i just began reading off our intimate text messages and all the shit he told me as he slowly began to piece together what was happening 
 dave went dead silent and turned off his xbox 
 i then proceeded to undoubtedly prove once and for all to the rest of my friends that this girl was 100 % fake because andy was going along with it the whole time acting like she was real yet it was me therefore it was clear he was lying the whole time 
 the best part was that it really destroyed andy and dave 's friendship in a way that never really healed because they could n't trust each after andy had knowingly let dave have relations with a complete stranger 
 i also found out from one of our mutual friends that david was so upset about it that it made him depressed and at times he could n't even eat food it fucked with him so bad 
 needless to say i never really had a problem with either of them trying to fuck with me after that 
 in fact they both hated me so much that they refused to even be in the same xbox party with me ever again 
 they could no longer truly fit in our group of friends because as long as i was playing they would n't and at last the problem was solved 
 when i had to make up a credit in summer school i sat beside a skinny little weed dealer harmless spaceman 
 this kid arrived at school very day with a new bruise or bump and it turned out he was being beaten by a giant and very stupid goon until he turned over his weed 
 half way through the course i contracted a <unk> case of poison ivy and the skinny spaceman asked me where i had contracted it 
 after i told him he smiled and got this <unk> far away look in his eyes 
 the following monday the spaceman came to school undamaged and <unk> 
 giant stupid goon did not come at all 
 spaceman had rolled some poison ivy into a few joints and let goon take them from him 
 goon never came back to class and did not write the exam 
 stone cold spaceman 
 edit : i had no idea what spaceman was planning to do and i doubt he really thought it through 
 i never saw the goon again or spaceman after the exam 
 this all happened in the mid <unk> felt like sharing this with you guys as it 's kind of your <unk> 
 anyway few years back i was working as a hotel receptionist 
 we were a hotel of about 75 rooms so roughly <unk> capacity and we just so happened to have the bulk of 2 <unk> guests staying with us 
 needless to say we were busy and seeing as it was just us two on we manned the bar and reception they were joint 
 one wedding had a lot of these rich smarmy silver spoon in mouths type of people 
 they were n't all dicks in their party some of them were genuinely nice interesting people who were behaving politely and well behaved 
 it was for this reason that we kept the bar open for them 
 anyway as the night starts to wind down people are going to bed we shut the bar people are fine with this ... except one 
 this one smarmy prick who wanted everyone to know his upper class status his wealth what car he drove 
 <unk> 
 so we tell him that we will not be serving any more alcohol and that the bar is closed 
 nope he did n't like that 
 demands that it be left open and that he has spent loads of money to demand this the guy spent <unk> on a room and about <unk> on beer not earth shattering amounts seeing as people had spent far more than that 
 we politely tell him to <unk> to his room 
 nope again 
 this time he squares up to my friend 
 at this point i should note that my friend is a licensed doorman and ex military so he can handle himself 
 my friend proceeds to tell mr. high society that he will need to return to his room or <unk> the hotel 
 nope 
 he pushes my friend 
 i call the police as we could n't kick the guy out of the hotel and let him wander around as the hotel was on a <unk> which was in between 2 busy roads and it would be <unk> 
 the guy knowing he 's fucked up just sits there all quiet whilst we wait for the police 
 the police arrive and arrest the guy for being drunk and disorderly 
 here 's the <unk> part 
 they put the guy in the back of police car and talk to myself and my friend 
 whilst we 're talking we here this strange noise over the <unk> shoulder radio 
 that noise turns into some screaming to be let out 
 yup scared the crap out of all of us 
 so we all turn around and <unk> boy is holding the in car radio screaming at the top of his voice 
 yup police were n't impressed 
 so they <unk> him and station the other officer with him 
 they finish with us and they 're about to leave when they find the dirty bastard is laughing his head off at pissing himself on the back seat of the police car 
 so 
 much 
 win 
 because of this guy not wanting to go to bed he landing himself with an <unk> drunk and disorderly charge unsolicited use of police <unk> criminal damage and the cost to clean 
 and to add icing on the cake when his friends come down the next morning to check out and ask where he is and if we checked him out already we tell them all what happened 
 and they laughed their <unk> off 
 oh and we found <unk> on the floor where he was sitting 
 <unk> 
 tl dr bar shuts guy gets abusive to staff police called makes more trouble for himself by fucking with their radios pisses himself permanent criminal record public humiliation by his friends when i was in middle school mainly <unk> grade things called paper wasps were insanely popular among everybody 
 basically all you had to do to make one was take a piece of paper and shape it in an <unk> then you flung it at someone else with a rubber band 
 they hurt like hell 
 unfortunately since i was quite <unk> i would get attacked by these on a regular basis especially on the bus when no teacher was around the bus driver did n't do shit 
 most of them came from a kid we 'll call seth 
 he sat at the back of the bus where all the popular kids sat and would always shoot them at the back of my head when i was n't looking 
 when i would try to confront him about it he would blame the many kids sitting in the area and continue once my head was turned 
 starting in the middle of sixth grade this went on until my seventh grade year was nearly finished 
 i tried everything to stop it 
 the principal came on the bus one day to try to <unk> anyone from shooting them telling us that the bus driver would report anyone who shot them 
 this helped for a few months but after a while the attacks would begin again 
 shooting these things at me was a favorite past time among everybody and soon seth was n't the only kid who would be doing it 
 even though i did n't like it i had barely any friends and i sort of made myself believe that this was their way of accepting me into their circle 
 then this happened in art class one day in seventh grade which made me believe otherwise 
 i was minding my own business while at the same time looking at seth and his group who were <unk> in one corner of the room 
 this made me anxious because it did n't look like they were doing their project 
 i spotted a few of them of a group of 12 or so looking at me and laughing 
 i figured they were planning something so i was planning on <unk> myself from the class once i finished the project we were n't allowed to leave the room long-term otherwise 
 but just as i was about to turn my work in seth casually gets up which gets me more anxious and before i can react he takes out a rubber band and shoots a wasp in the worst place a guy can be hit in 
 yup 
 i obviously do n't react lightly to this and <unk> to the floor while the whole class <unk> out in laughter 
 the teacher tries to calm everyone down but even when she does this the damage is done 
 seth and the rest of his buddies get sent out of the room and while on the floor i realize that what he hit me with was n't paper 
 this was a completely different material later dubbed metal wasps '' 
 i forget what they actually made it from but they <unk> so hard that i had to keep myself from crying which would make the whole ordeal even worst 
 because of the embarrassment i got my parents to take me home where i planned my <unk> revenge on seth who made my school life a living hell 
 on the way home i made my mom stop at the store where i would get the supplies for my revenge 
 i bought dozens of rubber bands and paper along with the material that was used for the metal wasps i do n't think it was actually metal though 
 i spent the rest of the day practicing my aim and before the days end i had it 
 unfortunately i could n't take out my plan the very next day because seth and his cronies got suspended for three days 
 but that meant i had plenty more time to practice 
 when the day finally came for seth 's return i stuffed my bag with dozens of rubber bands and <unk> wasps -- all of which were intended for seth 
 the day went on as usual but every time i would be picked on mostly by seth i would just imagine the satisfaction i would get once i had pulled this off 
 then it finally came 
 i admit i was nervous 
 i never did anything this malicious before and i feared i would get in trouble 
 but i decided it did n't matter and <unk> the rubber band and paper wasp turning around 
 seth was talking to a popular <unk> grade girl who we 'll call kelly 
 no one really noticed me -- they were doing their own thing but i focused on seth who was really enjoying his conversation with kelly 
 then i fired 
 and i got it in his eye 
 i stared at him <unk> 
 i did n't mean to get it in his eye -- i was actually <unk> for the side of his face 
 and then he started <unk> crying really hard 
 i did n't move at all still stayed in the same position so someone eventually figured out that it was me that did it 
 i eventually got out of my stupor and carried out my original plan firing dozens of paper and metal wasps and all of them hit seth 
 not one of his friends stopped me laughing as he <unk> from my wasps 
 as this was going on kelly laughed along with them for a short while before going back to her friends who were all popular and paid us no attention 
 the laughter and <unk> seth was enough to annoy the bus driver and eventually i was kicked off the buss a few blocks from my stop 
 before i walked off the bus driver said in seth 's defense you should n't pick on people who are weaker than you '' which made me and everyone else laugh even harder 
 literally the whole buss <unk> as i walked off 
 the best part 
 after the fact seth tried to get me in trouble with the school but he was ignored because they know very well that seth picked on me 
 and i 'm a good kid 
 i would n't do a thing like that i have no idea if they tried to contact the bus driver or not but the school sided with me 
 they thought that seth asked one of his friends who did n't side with him thankfully to do that to him 
 he got detention for trying to get me in trouble 
 tl dr : bully <unk> me for over a year 
 i give him a taste of his own medicine and humiliate him in front of all his <unk> a fine summer 's day in <unk> old <unk> i drove off from the lights at a reasonable rate 
 fuckwit driving next to me then decides that he must be in front of me when the road turns into a single lane and cuts me off forcing me to brake <unk> 
 i did not take kindly to this 
 i flash my lights he flips me off 
 well played fuckwit 
 however i also flipped him off in a spectacular display of both <unk> and <unk> 
 the road then becomes two lanes at the next set of traffic lights 
 i am in left lane fuckwit in the right 
 the lights turn green and i floor it 
 unsurprisingly fuckwit and his <unk> <unk> take this as a direct insult to his <unk> - he must be faster 
 so he goes past me but i do not give up 
 quickly we are <unk> over the speed limit of 60km/h 
 approaching another intersection i quickly brake down to 60km/h 
 victorious fuckwit shoots through the intersection 
 the intersection that i knew had a fixed speed camera 
 suck it 
 tl dr <unk> dangerously cuts me off i get him to speed through a speed <unk> figured after my more heavy and dramatic revenge story i would post a much more <unk> one where i actually do more than just walk away 
 tl dr down the bottom this happened a while ago but a post on the front page of reddit reminded me of it 
 back in august 2012 i started doing my certificate iii in networking at uni 
 the classroom was always noisy because of this particular group of classmates 
 it happened with every teacher except the ones that would n't take their crap the big teacher who straight out kicked them out and well the head teacher during other classes they were really loud and annoying and this is when i 'm trying to do my weekly tests and sometimes <unk> and studying for <unk> since i failed the first times 
 it was very very frustrating and difficult to <unk> 
 anyone who has done networking will understand it 's a lot to take in 
 it would happen every week 
 every time i would mention it to the other two teachers ones response was * '' oh but its nice to have some noise the other classes are so quiet '' * and the other teacher was this socially awkward teacher with a <unk> who did n't really do anything about it 
 so every time toward the last quarter of these classes these annoying students would fuck around and browse whatever they want laughing about all the stuff they 're seeing and what they 're going to do after class and since i 'm a slow <unk> i generally would still be doing my work and asking the teacher for assistance 
 i had previously spoken to these annoying students but they never really listened 
 now it pays to mention these pushover teachers are in their late 40s early 50s 
 their hearing is n't that great and to be honest neither is mine 
 i had discovered this application that allowed me to play really high pitch noises 
 i even showed it to my classmates during one of my classes where everyone was discussing work 
 so they knew i had it 
 in reality i was n't just showing it to them i was <unk> what levels they could hear it where i could n't 
 i think this was around ... <unk> 
 at levels they could hear it it was <unk> it was playing with their heads and they <unk> wanted me to turn it off 
 i 'm not <unk> bothered by it when i hear it so i do n't quite understand but i oblige 
 an intense feeling of happiness washed over me 
 justice was going to get served 
 i was ready i had my nifty little <unk> to get my revenge in my pocket 
 i felt like <unk> 
 skip forward a few days and we 're in ** socially awkward teacher 's ** class 
 of course the douchebag classmates start being rowdy toward the end of the class when i 'm still studying and getting work done while i 'm at the class computer 
 this is when i take out my secret weapon 
 i turn my phone speakers up and blast the tone at <unk> 
 occasionally making it go up and down by a bit to produce different pitches 
 i then call the teacher over for help with a subject 
 the teacher ** can not ** hear it 
 it was a success the most subtle type of revenge and i was doing it right in front of the teacher 
 as the teacher is helping me i can hear the comments of the the douche classmates on the other side of the room 
 douchebag 1 : <unk> i fuckin hate that noise thing <unk> douchebag 2 : <unk> so annoying 
 ** douchebag 3 : <unk> lets <unk> they then left the classroom and i was left in peace to study 
 for a few weeks i did this until i think they finally got the hint 
 it did n't matter though once the term was over i switched classes into a class where i had people i actually liked 
 **tl dr** classmates are annoying to me in class when im trying to study i do n't have the best hearing i find a high frequency tone generator and blast it at a tone that me and my teacher can not hear 
 they get angry and leave 
 i get to study in peace 
 <unk> went to a friend 's house to set up his surprise going away party and a man i had only ever heard of in passing opened the door 
 we shake hands and introduce ourselves 
 let 's call him richard 
 upon hearing my name richard says oh right <unk> you 're the <unk> 
 so you have seizures when i go like this '' 
 and proceeded to flip the lights on and off 
 now it was n't yet dark enough and he was n't doing it fast enough for it to actually set off a seizure but the thing about seizures is that people can literally die from them so as soon as the first moment of panic passed and i remember that i was <unk> 
 * so i punched him in the face hard enough to break his nose in full view of everyone else 
 somebody called the police but no one else there was an asshole and some of them had seen me <unk> before mostly absence seizures but i 've been told that those can be more terrifying to witness than <unk> seizures 
 so when the police came and i made up a story about how i had had a seizure because of something richard did to try to set off a seizure they backed me up and said that i would n't have known what i was doing 
 so they <unk> richard and escorted both of us to the hospital 
 edit : <unk> posted this on /r/pettyrevenge a long time ago from my old account 
 at that time i do n't think /r/prorevenge existed 
 here is the story : this happened almost 15 years ago 
 the year was <unk> and i was in my junior year of college 
 there was a hate site called <unk> 
 it was an <unk> site that contained lots of literature and posts against <unk> and indians 
 i do n't remember how i came across the site but originally i just thought it was a regular discussion forum and i joined it 
 soon i realized that the people on there were pretty much insane and so full of hatred that there was no way to convince them 
 once they found out i was indian *and* <unk> i started getting hate messages 
 eventually they just banned me 
 i then decided to harass them by creating troll accounts and spamming the board 
 they reacted by blocking my accounts 
 so i 'd create a new one and <unk> the cycle 
 this was getting <unk> so being a cs major i decided to <unk> the process 
 since this was in <unk> there was very little by way of <unk> protection or <unk> or any of that 
 you could copy the code for their submission form and submit a post from a local file 
 the first thing i did was to create a simple script that would spam the board from a single account 
 they would ban that user and then i would create a new one 
 they knew it was me and one of them even threatened to send a letter to my university '' which i laughed off because they had no idea where i was 
 i lay low for a few days to give them false comfort and then i decided to spam them right 
 the board 's <unk> form did n't have any protection either 
 so i wrote a script that did the following : - register a random username 
 - spam the message board for a random amount of time 
 - repeat 
 this way if they blocked the user another user would start up in a little while 
 i finished the script at around 10 or 11 at night so i started it up and went to bed 
 next morning i checked their site ... and i found over <unk> to <unk> spam messages on their message board 
 they were freaking out and talking about being hacked '' 
 they had also blocked all posts to the forum except for a few users and had started cleaning up the spam 
 after they cleaned it up they cautiously opened up posting to all users again 
 i did n't bother them for a week and they thought they were in the clear 
 then bam 
 i started up the script again 
 this time i had multiple instances of the script running so up to 4-5 <unk> were posting at the same time 
 the next morning there were around <unk> posts in *all* of their sub forums 
 the forum was pretty much unusable 
 they could n't even post because every legitimate new post would be <unk> out by the spam posts 
 they then made the forum invite-only but there was still a shit ton of spam to clean up 
 i checked in on the site from time to time to find it pretty much dead 
 they were still trying to clean up the spam and there were no new users or posters since it was invite-only 
 they never quite recovered and after a week or two the site went down 
 i like to think that i had something to do with that 
 : tl dr i stumble across a forum 
 i start posting only to discover that they are racist <unk> 
 i get banned 
 i use my <unk> <unk> skills to spam them into <unk> 
 site never <unk> and goes <unk> ago i worked as a truck driver even owned my own trucks for a while 
 one of the companies i used to trip lease to had several different <unk> 
 called them up one day to see if they had freight 
 was told they could n't load me till i talked to joe not his real name joe was in charge of safety which includes driver records 
 little background on joe is an asshole 
 he played favorites to the guys who worked out of the same terminal as he did 
 he and i went round and round a few times 
 back story 
 i called him up and he wo n't tell me anything on the phone 
 says i have to come see him in person and they ca n't load me till i do 
 i blew him off since i had about 15 other companies i was trip leasing to at the time 
 fast forward a week 
 i happen to be in the area on personal business and i stop in to see him 
 he is especially nice which should have tipped me off that something was up 
 he keeps me waiting about 20 minutes finally get to talk to him 
 tells me he ca n't load me because my license was under suspension 
 tell him i 'll take care of it 
 go out get in the car and just as i leave the property i get pulled over 
 the bastard set me up that was why he kept me waiting 20 minutes 
 gave the state police time to get there 
 they arrested me and took me to jail on a friday evening 
 did n't get to see the <unk> till monday 
 payed my fines payed my <unk> fees and went on my way 
 now i realize that it was my fault for not paying the fine 
 to be honest i got three tickets that day when i mailed them in 2 weeks later i missed one of them 
 at that time i was working pretty much 7 days a week 
 all my mail not that there was much of it was going to my brothers house 
 my brother failed to let me know he had mail there from the state 
 joe could have simply told me about it so i could have taken care of it 
 but no the fucker got me arrested 
 i sat on this for 8 or 9 years 
 one day i 'm out in the truck and see one of their trucks from joe 's terminal 
 i get on the cb radio and call out to him 
 me : hey abc trucking you got your radio on 
 abc : go ahead 
 me : does joe still work there 
 abc : yeah he does why 
 me : that asshole fucked me a while back tell him i have n't forgotten about him 
 abc : no shit 
 what did he do now 
 me : ca n't tell you it could possibly reveal my identity 
 but you tell that bastard i know where he lives i know where his wife shops i know where his daughters go to collage i even know where they sleep at night 
 tell him he fucked with the wrong person 
 abc : i 'll pass it on 
 i kept this routine up every time i saw one of their trucks 
 about the 4th one i ran into told me joe was shitting his pants 
 had pulled his girls out of collage 
 would n't let them or his wife go anywhere without an escort 
 was driving different vehicles to work 
 made his wife change her shopping habits all the time 
 i pretty much completely disrupted their lives 
 next truck i saw i told him to tell joe that having his wife and daughters escorted around was n't going to help him 
 pretty much i kept him running scared on and off for 2 years or so 
 i always took information one driver would give me and use it in my next conversation with another driver 
 so joe thought some one was always watching him 
 even though i had n't seen him since the day he got me arrested 
 i did find out that he became less of an asshole after that 
 amazing story a good friend just posted about <unk> with her father : my father is a shy and quiet man 
 growing up he and i weren’t close 
 he didn’t quite understand my overly dramatic responses to everything 
 we didn’t <unk> on any level 
 the only time he generally spoke to me was when he was angry with me because i was arguing with my mom 
 however when i was 11 i was able to form a special secret bond with my father 
 we did a very bad thing and then kept the secret from my mother and in my mind the authorities 
 this secret which will now no longer be a secret has bonded us together ever since 
 to this day we still talk about the time when we practically broke the law 
 my dad still <unk> with pride as if it was his <unk> moment 
 it’s a story i treasure because it’s ours 
 sunday was <unk> church day in our house 
 my mother taught sunday school my brother attended sunday school i <unk> in the children’s choir and my dad was a <unk> or some such ranking official 
 after church my mother would stay in town and pick up greeting cards at the hallmark store or refill prescriptions 
 on this particular sunday my parents had driven separately to church so my father wouldn’t have to partake in card shopping 
 my brother was going with my mom 
 i <unk> my options and decided to forego shopping and hopped in my father’s pickup truck 
 <unk> have to stop off at the <unk> my father said 
 my father was the owner and operator of the town’s only garbage removal company <unk> disposal service <unk> refuse you can’t <unk> 
 we didn’t have <unk> garbage service in our tiny village and my father had trucks employees a <unk> offices and he also managed the city dump 
 as a child i was always embarrassed of his work 
 kids would pick on me about being a garbage <unk> or <unk> having enough to <unk> later in life i would come to appreciate the financial benefits to being the daughter of a <unk> <unk> and have since been quite proud of my father’s business 
 as we pulled up to the shop i noticed two garbage trucks parked in front of the garage 
 my dad immediately started swearing 
 <unk> fucking son of a bitch 
 i’m god damned tired of his bullshit 
 he’s stealing from me 
 seven fucking dollars a month and he’s stealing from me 
 god damned son of a bitch 
 <unk> get in the god damned garbage truck ” this was probably more words than my father had ever spoken to me and the first time i’d heard him say the <unk> word 
 i was <unk> 
 as i climbed in the garbage truck my father explained 
 an angry guy who lived around the corner refused to pay his garbage bill and had gotten upset with my father about the fee of $ <unk> a month for garbage service 
 after some yelling he promptly cancelled his service with my father 
 then the guy started sneaking his garbage over to the shop at night and throwing it in the back of the garbage trucks that weren’t parked inside 
 he was in fact stealing from my father 
 my father continued on to say the guy wasn’t terribly smart as he always threw away his mail with his name and address and was easily identified 
 as we pulled up he had noticed new garbage thrown in the back of the truck not compressed including letters and <unk> 
 <unk> had 6 conversations with that guy about throwing his garbage in here 
 i told him i was going to take him to court if he didn’t <unk> i didn’t know what was going on but i was quite afraid of how angry my dad was 
 i’d never seen that part of him before 
 i thought maybe we were going to drive over to the guy’s house and fight him 
 i was truly scared of what might happen because i didn’t consider my dad a good <unk> he was too shy and nice 
 my dad backed the full garbage truck onto the street and turned the corner 
 we soon pulled up to a ranch style home with a sizeable front yard 
 i could only assume this was angry guy’s house but i was still completely unsure what my dad had in mind 
 instead of pulling into the driveway my father swore a few more times and backed the garbage truck through the front yard stopping <unk> at the moment the back of the truck touched the cement set of porch stairs 
 there were deep tire tracks in the grass and mud <unk> had formed where grass once grew 
 crime 1 : destruction of property 
 i was only able to <unk> what was going on outside through the side mirror but from inside the truck i noticed my father pushing buttons and pulling <unk> 
 then i realized what was happening 
 my father was dumping the entire garbage truck filled with trash onto the man’s front steps and porch 
 this was all the trash that truck had picked up and <unk> in a day 
 this was much much more than angry man’s trash 
 it was half the town’s trash 
 as we pulled away my father exclaimed “i bet he doesn’t dump his garbage in my trucks again ” i looked back as we drove off to see a mountain and a half of garbage propped perfectly in front of the house piled high on the cement patio 
 the wrought iron railing held it all neatly in place and the front door was no longer visible behind the wall of refuse 
 crime 2 : littering crime 3 : front yard invasion i kept imagining angry guy walking out his front door in his bathrobe <unk> and searching for his sunday paper only to find a mountain of trash he would have no way of removing 
 i imagined him taking a few seconds to realize who had done the deed and then calling the police to have us arrested 
 my dad just smiled 
 i think he was imagining the man in his bathrobe standing in a pile of garbage too 
 then in typical <unk> my father said <unk> tell your mother 
 that was probably <unk> in that instant i knew i was special 
 my dad trusted me with his illegal activities and now i had something in common with him a connection i’d never had before 
 although i was somewhat horrified of the whole incident i was excited to have something to talk about with my dad when i visited him in jail 
 i also was secretly proud that my dad was such a badass 
 we quickly drove back to the shop and got into my <unk> pickup and headed home 
 i was speechless and my father was too busy beaming to say a word 
 when we arrived 4 minutes later i didn’t look my mother in the eye 
 i feared she would see the crimes written in my pupils 
 i knew the police would soon be taking me away 
 based on what i had learned about jail from tv i determined i was an accomplice 
 i’d most likely be going to jail for 10-15 years and my father would certainly get life 
 i tried not to cry as i sat on the couch searching out the window waiting for the police to come 
 i was afraid for weeks always fearful when a car pulled down our street 
 the police never came and my father and i kept our secret 
 one day years later he told me the guy started coming to the dump <unk> after that and paid to dump his trash there instead 
 he never said a word to my dad about the mountain of trash and apparently no witnesses ever put me at the scene of the crime 
 now every time i bring up that story my dad laughs so hard he cries 
 he’s still so proud of the day he took down the man who stole from him 
 he always finishes the story with <unk> never did dump his trash in my trucks <unk> then he always says between tears <unk> guess we really did have a refuse he couldn’t <unk> i never did understand that <unk> but i too laugh until i cry just the same 
 i think this deserves to be here because this revenge took an epic 7 years to exact 
 for context i moved across the world when i was 11. in my country of original <unk> i started a year early and skipped a grade so if i had continued along this path i would be graduating high school at the age of 16. i moved to australia and because i had almost finished 7th grade but i was young i was told i needed to be <unk> to check my competency 
 fair enough i guess - my family expected as much 
 what we did n't expect however was the school counselor 
 he <unk> me asked some questions and then spoke to my mother afterwards 
 he decided that i should be put into 6th grade which was just starting due to start date of the school year even though i was about halfway through 7th grade 
 i believe his exact words were spaghetti is very <unk> which makes him appear more intelligent than he actually is '' 
 pretty crushing thing for a 10 year old to hear 
 you are n't actually that smart you just sound smart 
 so here goes mate i 'm going to prove you as wrong as i possibly can 
 i 'm going to be the best damn 6th grader you 've ever seen in yo life 
 fast forward to senior year of high school and it 's college application time 
 i 've been invited into several extended programs and as a result i 've finished two semesters of university <unk> and one of physics 
 this counselor meets with all students individually to discuss college plans or lack <unk> so he knew i was looking into international programs - specifically <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 several weeks after our initial meeting he approaches me about a program that 's being established in the middle east american campuses <unk> into international waters 
 the school had been invited to <unk> a student and he had chosen me because of my stellar grades <unk> and motivation to <unk> different options 
 my mother and i were invited in to discuss this possibility after i realized i was going to apply 
 i had already written my <unk> and needed to discuss some logistics as a nominated student him signing off as the <unk> references from faculty etc 
 i will never forget the expression on his face when my mum asked him if he remembered the last time they had met 
 i remember you '' 
 she said 
 we met about 7 years ago 
 do you recall what you said about spaghetti '' 
 he shakes his head 
 oh you told me he was <unk> and appeared smart but was n't actually that smart 
 is n't it funny that you 're <unk> him for this now '' 
 ringing dead silence and he goes bright red 
 for the record i was accepted to the program a liberal arts college with a sub 2 % acceptance rate and i 'm lucky enough to study and live all over the world 
 spaghetti : 1. counselor : 0 
 “the best revenge is massive <unk> - frank <unk> story happened a while back when i was in uni 
 back then i was studying overseas and lived with my brother who had a driver 's license and a car 
 we both went to the same school so i regularly hitched rides from him 
 the uni has a whole car park dedicated for students however as we both attend the largest faculty we usually had to arrive early for a spot or you would just end up <unk> for an eternity trying to find one 
 one morning we arrived fairly close to our lecture time and were desperately trying to find a park 
 we eventually spotted someone pulling out of a lot and we <unk> our parking intentions and waited behind the lot 
 as the car pulled out and engaged the drive gear this fucking prick takes advantage of the fact the driver was heading in our direction and <unk> into the lot as we had to wait for the original driver to driver off 
 <unk> we let rip with the horn and told him exactly what we thought of his behaviour 
 this prick then proceeds to exit his car grinning at us before flipping the bird and <unk> off to class 
 extremely pissed and running late we had no choice but to circle the <unk> again and pray we got lucky 
 and you know what 
 we did get lucky 
 we found a spot within a minute and decided that this fucking prick was going to pay 
 so my brother and i headed back to the pricks car with revenge on our minds 
 now the pricks car was an old bomb which probably meant that he did n't have a lot of money 
 this is important because we figured that if we let out all the air in his tyres he would n't have the means to tow it somewhere to get the air pumped back in 
 thus with my brother acting as a look out i slowly <unk> all the air in all four tyres 
 <unk> me late for class but grinning like a fool as a entered 
 my <unk> was not impressed 
 i left uni that day and forgot about the incident until the end of the week when i next had class 
 as me and my brother arrived we saw that the pricks car was still there in the same lot 
 this made me burst out laughing and i gave my brother a quick fist bump creating an impromptu tradition each time we saw his car 
 this carried on for the entire month as the pricks car started to collect parking tickets and was eventually presumably towed away 
 it was the most satisfying revenge i ever <unk> prorevenge it 's been a minute 
 but i 'm back with a new story that happened last night 
 okay so i am a bouncer 
 proof : username 
 tl dr <unk> supporters come into the bar 
 i throw them out 
 they wan na fight 
 good ole boy from alabama starts his wwe debut 
 titties and freedom 
 so a little background 
 i work at a bar in a college town 
 the dancefloor is outside and the entrance leads to an inside part 
 the university is famous because it has a large <unk> of foreign students 
 i 've <unk> through europe and i have a lot of foreign friends so i think it 's fantastic 
 mostly because a lot of them are 6 foot 8 <unk> volleyball girls that like to get drunk and dance <unk> on the stage but i digress 
 well recently at the bar we have been having a large group of fellas who happen to dislike america coming in 
 from what i have gathered watching them for several weeks throughout the night these guys like to <unk> their wealth and so called superiority more than anyone 
 they spend hundreds at the bar every night and tend to get pretty rowdy near the end of the night 
 that happens with a lot of people so it does n't bother me usually 
 but these assholes like to run their mouths about how much they hate america and how <unk> will win after they get drunk and they end up starting shit 
 i 'm not looking to get stabbed in a bar so i do n't appreciate that 
 i 'm not gon na throw them out for that though freedom of speech is the definition of america no matter how much i disagree with what they are saying 
 they can write their own death warrant in front of all these rednecks if they want to 
 i usually have to throw a few of them out when they come while they scream <unk> at me and tell me how they will whoop my ass and kill me 
 normal family fun 
 they never resist me when i am kicking them out though i usually just have to push them with one hand and they leave 
 pussies 
 not last night 
 well this weekend everyone from my town is celebrating <unk> gras in new <unk> so the bar was not nearly as packed as it usually is 
 these <unk> group of guys came in in about a group of 10. there were no football players or fraternity guys there that night so they were the big <unk> even more than they usually think they are 
 at about <unk> two of these dudes start pushing each other and yelling at each other pretty violently 
 i jump off of the stage and rip them apart from each other 
 well the taller of the pair who will be known as af for ass face wore his big boy pants that night because he yelled fuck you you american fuck '' 
 and took a swing at me 
 he was pretty drunk and all i had to do was lean back a little to make him miss 
 i immediately put him in a headlock as i usually do 
 well 
 his posse does n't like this 
 they do n't like this at all and they 're all really drunk 
 so they start to circle up around me 
 this does n't pose a huge problem because i 'm a big dude and they are not 
 i push through them as i 'm getting yelled at in what i was told was <unk> and get af inside 
 well working the door inside is my coworker d-wreck 
 d-wreck is a good ole boy from alabama 
 d-wreck is very pro-violence 
 well i get af inside and the bar starts clapping 
 you outta here mother fucker '' 
 you fucked up now '' 
 my boss sees me coming and throws open the double doors so i can throw this dude outside 
 leading up to the bar we have a <unk> with guardrails on it 
 this will become relevant soon 
 well as soon as i push af out the doors he turns on me 0 to 100 <unk> real quick 
 now it would be no problem for me to handle this asshole but d-wreck had different plans 
 i heard him before i saw him 
 there was a bald eagle screech in the distance and i could hear <unk> playing in the air 
 d-wreck comes <unk> out of the crowd and <unk> af over the <unk> railing like the wwe royal <unk> 
 af did a flip and landed straight on his back knocking the breath out of him 
 d-wreck not satisfied with his <unk> performance so far jumps over the railing with a flying knee into af 's <unk> 
 if it gives you any <unk> into the type of guy that d-wreck is he started barking at af 
 this scared the fuck outta the rest of his friends and they got their friend and <unk> it the fuck outta there 
 d-wreck howled into the night looked at me and yelled thank you 
 i 've been looking to fuck someone up all night '' 
 the best part was that we looked at them on camera and the dude that i <unk> tried to fight his friends and ended up <unk> ass in the parking lot and fucking up his face 
 they 've all been permanently banned from the bar 
 i guess if you support terrorism you should n't be so much of a pussy 
 then i went home and <unk> my beauty queen girlfriend in the name of freedom 
 because <unk> was a few years older then tony growing up 
 i was also the more adventurous type 
 at the time of this story i was in 8th grade and he was in 6th 
 i was having an awfully hard time in my english class surprise surprise and i was set to fail for the year if i did n't improve my grades 
 i however had more important things to do such as chasing this girl i was after 
 well that monday night tony let out that we had gotten our report cards for the semester 
 my parents asked how i was doing and tony advised them that i was pretty much guaranteed to <unk> my 8th grade year which i did by the way cause of english 
 my father was not happy that i had 1. hidden my report card from him 2. we about to fail english and have to repeat 8th grade he knew my activities i was into sports hanging out and finding parties 
 well my dad confirmed tony reports of my failure and grounded me that tuesday 
 i found out tony was the one who told them about the report card and i proceeded to dish out the pain to him in the form of a <unk> sibling beating 
 i thought i was free and clear as tony took it without saying anything even apologized for telling our parents about the report cards 
 well that friday night i had a party and the girl i was chasing at the time was going be there 
 now of course i was on restriction 
 however i knew my dad he 'd be passed out by 9 pm and my mom would be watching her tv and pass out around 10 pm and not check on me 
 now before i go further we lived in the country at a time where crime was n't much of a concern we never locked our doors or windows 
 did i mention it was cold as could be as well 
 this was the winter after all 
 well i began climbing out the window when my brother tony saw me he told me i should n't do it cause i was on restriction 
 i said shut up and do n't tell them or i 'll beat you again '' he promised he would n't say a word to them 
 off i went found the party and had an amazing time 
 even got in an awesome make out session 
 i also got very drunk it was an awesome time 
 it was well after the street lights where turned off 
 it was bitterly cold but i had such an awesome time i felt immune to the cold 
 off i went home i went to the very same window i climbed out of ... it would n't open 
 what the hell 
 it was locked 
 i tried several other windows ... all locked 
 i thought i 'd try the door that was locked as well both of them the back and the front 
 what the hell 
 first time in my life all the windows and doors where locked in our house 
 i even thought of my parents window which surprise surprise was unlocked 
 then i thought about it my old man was sleeping and no way would be my drunken self be able to climb through his window without waking him up and he 'd be furious 
 so i thought i 'd wait it out did i mention it was bitterly cold 
 not <unk> or anything but i was dressed for a party not an out door adventure 
 i must have waited about an hr before i decided i should just man up and ring the doorbell maybe my brother tony would open the door instead 
 so i rang the doorbell and at last 
 my brother tony was sleeping in the living room 
 he turned on the light looked at me through the window ... and smiled as he turned and walked away 
 that motherfucker it took several more minutes of my drunken ass ringing the doorbell for my old man to wake up in the middle of the night and find his <unk> son at the door drunk as could be when he was supposed to be on restriction 
 my old man was pissed and he proceeded for the first time in several years to pull out his belt and whip me 
 boy did he whip me and that was just the tip of the iceberg 
 i was further more restricted and had a terrible next 5 months 
 the next day i of course i went to find out tony to dish out an even greater ass kicking ... when he met me and said before you throw the first punch just remember what happened to you last time ... next time could be worse '' i thought for a moment tony had screwed me over good 
 he also never told my parents i was out partying 
 he just locked all the windows and doors in our house 
 that was creative thinking right there i decided at that point to call it even 
 i never fucked with tony <unk> uncle always likes to tell this story 
 hopefully i have the details down well enough from hearing it over the years 
 about 20 years ago he and my aunt used to live outside of cleveland in a nice little suburb 
 they had quite a few weird neighbors though 
 one of them was what i gathered as your typical scumbag stacy 
 she lived across the street and was as hot as they came but <unk> insane 
 her scumbag boyfriend lived across the neighborhood but close enough to be at her house frequently 
 behind them was walt 
 i do n't know his actual name but we 'll go with walt because that 's a good old man name 
 walt as they told me was a very nice man unless you were black but that 's a different story 
 he had some health problems -- typical old man stuff a bad back a failing kidney uncomfortable stuff 
 overall he was a friendly neighbor 
 once the scumbag boyfriend got settled in his precious relationship you could hear the sound of his shitty <unk> old chevy rattling down the street from a mile away 
 it was definitely him 
 what made it worse is that he often <unk> down the street at the wee hours of the night 
 now walt was an old man who could n't sleep with his bad back and my aunt and uncle were busy raising my <unk> cousin 
 their <unk> <unk> frayed quickly 
 so you ask how do you get revenge on a guy with a loud truck 
 they did n't 
 they waited it out <unk> their teeth and lived their lives 
 but you see scumbags find a way to bring you to the frayed ends of <unk> 
 at 2am he woke the neighborhood up with a loud bang 
 you could hear the shitty chevy speeding away down the <unk> cleveland roads 
 walt woke up and <unk> rolled out of bed to discover that scumbag drove up to his mailbox tossed an m80 firecracker inside and drove away while it made its loud boom inside the metal mailbox 
 this continued <unk> for a few weeks 
 <unk> hell no 
 one night my uncle rigged a device to grab it and chuck it back out of the mailbox 
 he described it as a rat trap with a paper <unk> on it 
 they waited 
 and waited 
 scumbag did n't do this every night 
 he 'd separate his attacks far apart enough so that right when you 'd forget about him bang 
 you 'd hear it once again in the loud metal mailbox at 2am 
 and you 'd hear the shitty chevy speed off 
 some dark tuesday night walt was still <unk> to sleep with his bad back and my uncle and aunt were trying to get in a tiny bit of sleep before my little cousin would rise and shine 
 by coincidence my uncle was awake when he heard a shitty chevy pull out from across the street 
 he heard it slow down and stop real quick with its shitty diesel engine disrupting the peaceful night 
 *here comes scumbag with another m80 
 * then a brief silence 
 then <unk> 
 ** the mailbox contraption flung the m80 back <unk> the <unk> where scumbag had just enough time to cover his eyes before it went boom in the passenger seat 
 the shitty chevy <unk> down the street once more this time a bit more <unk> 
 they did n't hear anymore shitty diesel engines at 2am for a long time <unk> told this should go here so here it is : i <unk> cut this guy off 
 i waved at him and yelled i was sorry 
 he followed me stopped at stop light and threatened to beat me up 
 tried to get me out of my car 
 i took pictures of his car he told me he’d shoot me 
 so i drove off 
 i 'm a guy who is very afraid of confrontation 
 i <unk> to a lot of research sites and i reverse looked him up based on his license plate number 
 i got everything i could 
 his car had a college license plate and a marine corps sticker 
 so with his full name his address and the school he went to he was easy to find on facebook 
 i created a fake facebook account with pictures of a girl i found on the net 
 and i <unk> him 
 he accepted and started chatting me up a bit 
 just in messages though 
 i could see everything about him saw who is wife was and that he had kids 
 one day he asked if i’d call him 
 so i bought one of those cell phones from a grocery store and texted him 
 told him i couldn’t call that my boyfriend was the jealous type but i wanted out 
 our texting went on and on and i eventually started sending him selfie shots of a girl i found 
 she had a full <unk> and i’d save each image for different days 
 he started texting me images of his dick and him jerking off 
 even a picture of him <unk> onto one of the pictures i sent 
 i started sending <unk> of <unk> cards to his home addressed to him no return address 
 he flipped and asked me via text if it was me 
 he insisted that we meet to talk about it 
 so i pretended to be my “boyfriend” and told him i was going to blow his fucking brains out 
 then i took pictures of everything the entire exchange and mailed this entire book to his wife 
 she ended up leaving and they got a divorce 
 the idiot never <unk> me from facebook 
 he lost his house had to pay alimony and child support 
 he whined about being taken to the <unk> by his <unk> <unk> 
 don’t know what to think about this one 
 i have this thing where if people really cross me on the road i’ll do background searches on them and then will mess with them 
 most stuff is i find out someone had a criminal record and i anonymously ask their employer if they know 
 or i <unk> to barely legal porn mags gay or straight and have it mailed to their home or work 
 but this one i went farther than i ever had 
 something about the way that guy kept trying to get me out of my car so he could hurt me scared me and made me really angry 
 but i’m really bothered by the impact this had on his kids 
 this guy was the last time i did the <unk> and <unk> thing 
 i think i may have taken it too far 
 this is my mom 's story 
 my <unk> dad would often argue over stupid petty things that drove my mom crazy 
 dishes were n't washed to his army <unk> she parked the car wrong in the driveway you get the picture 
 she held it in the best she could but finally found a way to get back at him in the most petty but <unk> consistent way 
 he loved raisin bran 
 it was his <unk> bowl of happiness every morning 
 little by little the raisins started diminishing in the box 
 the hell 
 sure enough each new box of kellogg 's raisin bran had only a dozen or less raisin 's in each bowl he poured 
 he bitched complained and even called up to complain to kellogg 's once 
 some days he 'd get lucky as he opened the box 
 a complete proper bowl of raisins ... yet the next day only a few 
 he came up with theories that the raisins would only come to the top of the box because of shipping even bring up this <unk> at dinner parties and try to get a discussion going 
 my parents eventually separated when my sister and i were in high school and we lived with our mom 
 nearly a decade later we are having a massive family christmas gathering and everyone including my dad is present they were on speaking terms 
 we are playing this truth or <unk> game family friendly version of truth or dare and it gets to my mom 's turn 
 confession it is 
 <unk> we all know you love your raisin bran 
 * '' massive laughter and cheers as its a well known within the family 
 *well remember how they <unk> out on the raisins for those 10 or so years 
 i used the <unk> that was out in the garage and <unk> whole box every time we got a new one 
 i only put a half a <unk> back in and put the rest on the coffee table for <unk> '' you could hear a pin drop in that room as my dad just shook his head he took his cereal seriously 
 he just chuckled a laugh and the room burst out laughing 
 12 years of doing this to him 
 an old story of mine i used to go to a public high school where the majority of students were low to middle class italian origin kids of immigrants 90 % + 
 tough going to say the least 
 when i was in high school i used to get bullied by a guy called renaldo 
 we had a few scraps either verbally or <unk> over the years 
 i was always the type of guy who wouldn’t take other people’s shit and while others balked at giving me a hard time particularly when i went through puberty and became one of the <unk> largest guys in school he somehow always managed to give me a hard time 
 it was a tough time but in a way i paid my <unk> early and learnt from a stern father that if people punched you you punch back and you punch harder and you 'll know if they are men or not 
 as luck would have me renaldo ended up in the same college i went to and he always managed to somehow <unk> be a little shit to me 
 what made things worse is that we fell for the same girl andrea who eventually became my girlfriend of over 4 years 
 everyone knew he had feelings for her and that it killed him she was with me and not him 
 he always tried to <unk> her with random calls and emails being the son of a wealthy father who owned his own construction company that he had nice cars lots of money a bunch of shit that i didn’t have and over the years worked hard to earn coming from a low income family that was having problems making ends meet 
 he was a constant issue the first year of my relationship and we had several <unk> years later after college and shortly after i broke up with andrea i received an e-mail from him out of the blue 
 i never <unk> with him facebook didn’t exist back then and he went out and told me in an epic letter which went far too long swore at me in excess and used terrible english no wonder he never finished college and dropped out to work with daddy 
 basically it was a no one liked me in college and to f off '' 
 i haven’t seen him in well over 2 years nor did we have any real friends in common 
 as a way of keeping my cool nor did i want him to have the satisfaction to get me mad i never responded to his emails he sent several 
 however i could n't let his taunting go without consequences 
 so i went online and googled his name 
 after searching around a bit i easily found a complete profile of him regarding his career where he worked and what type of work it was 
 his father passed away recently and he now owned his father 's business and had a team of employees working for him 
 i <unk> a bit more and hung onto the address of his place of employment for several weeks while i plotted 
 one day i proceeded to go into a local sex shop and i purchased the largest fattest <unk> black dildo that i could find along with some ky and i went home wrote a special note for him and put it along with the big fat black dildo and ky and boxed it in a standard box that couldn’t be traced back to me and sent it priority mail that required for him specifically to sign 
 the note read since you have so much time to search out people that never gave a shit about you to begin with i figured you 'd have enough time to go fuck yourself with this '' 
 one of our mutual acquaintances dropped me an email a few days later 
 this acquaintance worked for renaldo during his internship '' and apparently the package arrived while they were preparing to head out for a team lunch on a friday and he was very excited to get the box opened since renaldo thought it was something he ordered online that he was expecting and would make it a good weekend '' and he opened it in front of a number of co-workers and instead of whatever he ordered he pulls out ... .a giant black <unk> dildo 
 <unk> nsfw living with a guy from the age of 19 i was besotted 
 he was a little older than me and a drummer 
 as a teenager i was bowled over and besotted and it was only a couple of months after we met that i moved in with him 
 we 'll call him pbb for <unk> <unk> bastard 
 i really really loved him 
 even when he told me he was still in love with his ex who had cheated on him and would insist i should do the <unk> and shopping and cooking even though we both worked full time because it was his house he earned more than me and i did n't pay any rent all of my wages went into his bank account in his name 
 in case you missed it i loved him i really did even when he 'd started to go out and <unk> happen to iron his own shirt 
 wearing aftershave 
 even when he went out for a couple with the lads '' then stumble in the bedroom at 3am hardly able to stand ... his excuse 
 someone had <unk> his drink '' 
 i even still loved him when he came in at 3am with his <unk> shirt all <unk> aftershave on and with a <unk> tag glowing from his neck ... his excuse 
 my mate steve did it to me for a laugh '' 
 i moved into the spare room in protest surely he would come in apologise change his ways promise not to go out as often not come back as drunk 
 nope 
 this <unk> went on for 2 months i still loved him but moved out to my parent 's house at the age of <unk> i just moved a few things out with me just my cassette stereo lol a couple of decades old this story and my clothes 
 i even left my beloved cat behind on the agreement when i get my own place i can come back and reclaim him 
 for some reason he let me keep a key 
 i realised only a couple of days later i had forgotten the lead for my boom box 
 i knew he was going to be out with the lads at the time i was driving back from work so deliberately timed it when he was n't at home 
 pre mobile phones i 'm not having the pain of speaking to him too much i love him 
 in and out job done 
 i walk in something is wrong 
 the house is clean 
 not clean but <unk> 
 wait what 's this on the <unk> 
 a generic love card no occasion but you know the kind a la roger the rabbit how much do i love you 
 let me count the ways '' 
 inside was neat <unk> writing dear pbb i love you so much from & lt insert cheating witch 's name cb & gt 
 slowly i see the cassette <unk> machine is flashing with a message 
 my curiosity <unk> charges me over there o little red flashing light what can you tell me 
 the female voice <unk> oh pbb i had such a <unk> night last night i ca n't wait to do it again soon '' 
 looking around the room two wine glasses 
 by this time my head is like a <unk> 
 i run upstairs to the room and there 's a fucking wedding ring next to his side of the bed 
 wtf 
 i am <unk> crying drive back to my parent 's house in bits 
 i walk in the door sobbing so hard and loud my mum asked if i had been abused .. i could n't talk for the <unk> bubbles of <unk> 
 why does n't he love me 
 we talk and i want revenge but more than petty 
 i plot 
 i plan 
 i think of sewing <unk> into the <unk> of his <unk> 
 too much hassle 
 cutting his clothes up 
 not my style 
 i am too subtle for that 
 i want <unk> passive revenge 
 dad got a van 
 we went the next day saturday with the cat basket 
 everything that i had bought and left behind i was going to take 
 only things that were mine 
 that was the only rule 
 side note : pbb used to <unk> every saturday at a music store in town talking drums and shit 
 he was screwing the owner 's sister 
 i recognised her voice and name from the love card 
 so i took the washing machine i had bought 3 months earlier - did i mention he was a drummer - i replaced it with a <unk> and <unk> he used for <unk> 
 i took the <unk> of christmas ham that was out of date in the cupboard 
 i took the cutlery as it was <unk> <unk> and i bought it from <unk> 
 i took the teabags as i had bought the last lot 
 i took the double bed and mattress and i took my cat 
 just before we left i told dad to sit in the van i had my own special goodbye to say 
 the previous night i had found every single printed photo of his face 
 this took an hour before camera phones etc i cut them all up and ripped them into quarters 
 i hid <unk> under carpets inside <unk> with <unk> flowers behind picture frames under <unk> back of cupboards inside the freezer ice cube <unk> and behind the bath panel 
 nothing obvious to the eye 
 whilst i was in the bathroom i opened the cabinet and saw his precious <unk> aftershave 
 i <unk> over the toilet pissed in it and put the top back on 
 finally i took the cassette recording from the answer machine stopped off on the way home at a phone box rang the music store where he always hung out on a saturday asked to speak to him and said in a calm controlled voice : ** '' you have one week to tell her husband 
 or i do '' ** and hung up 
 i sold the bed the same day to a <unk> down the pub sold the washing machine cut price to an elderly neighbour and <unk> my cat into my parent 's home he loved it there 
 i had a phone call at 3am when he got home to see he had no bed or washing machine and <unk> down the phone that i was an evil vitreous bitch '' 
 when i got up in the morning i had to get the <unk> out as it was pre google and i had no idea what vitreous meant 
 3 months later part 2 came into play 
 i started to call his friends pretend i was drunk giggle and confess i had pissed in his aftershave so eventually word got out what i had done but it was too late by then 
 tl dr cheating <unk> gets my piss kissed off his neck for months by cheating witch edit : <unk> winter 2013 dallas texas <unk> my senior year of high school i had a free period in the morning allowing me to arrive at school a full class period later than everyone else 
 this particular day it was pouring rain the streets were backed up and i was running late 
 i got to school around the time i needed to be in attendance at my first class 
 being late i knew that most of the choice parking spots would be occupied and i would have to walk a little way further than usual 
 this would n't normally be a problem my teacher was cool and did n't mind if people showed up a few minutes late except that it was pouring rain and i had important paper assignments to carry inside 
 i pull into the lot and there it was : the holy grail 
 there is an open spot right up against the school 
 i could park there and run under the lip of the roof and get to the front door with nothing wet but my shoes 
 as i <unk> the parking space i saw the car 
 a late model audi the lowest <unk> of german auto making occupying not one but two parking spaces 
 this was no accident 
 he was not parked a few inches over the line he was parked directly on top of it 
 normally i would deal with this in a sensible passive-aggressive manner by <unk> myself into the space to the left of him leaving only inches between my car and his <unk> door but the school parking spaces were <unk> and i drove a large american sedan 
 instead i was forced to circle the lot until i found the <unk> <unk> space a good 200 yards from the building 
 i tucked my papers under my shirt but the <unk> was too intense and they were soaked along with my clothes hair shoes socks and pride 
 as i passed the <unk> on my way towards the building i was overcome with rage 
 his windshield wipers were of the variety that slide easily on and off the <unk> so i pulled them off and dropped them down a nearby storm drain 
 if i had to walk to class in the rain he would have to drive home blinded by <unk> : this was a <unk> high class apartment community in the southern california orange curtain filled with residents and managers who think every problem is <unk> by money and anyone else contractor service employee or other was below them and expendable 
 as the security contractor we were expendable and they made it clear because we were hired to replace the previous contractor that we found out were set up to fail by the same managers that hired us 
 we were n't hired to provide security so much as for the company to have someone to blame as their liability shield if something went wrong 
 the conflict : among the many residents thinking that their high rent entitled them to the right to complain about anything they wanted was one that we will refer to as <unk> he would call in and complain at any hour he wanted most commonly <unk> minutes from 10 pm when the pools closed to complain about people in the pool or to tell us how to do our job the pools close at 10 pm and most of the time he called before that just to say we needed to close them 
 he would complain we were n't doing out job did n't do out job he could n't sleep because a neighbor was screwing too loudly all sorts of ridiculous things 
 he also left his window open which was probably why he supposedly could hear everything and later became his <unk> <unk> 
 the property managers offered to move him to a different apartment but he refused because of his view of the pools on the top floor and the managers would always settle because he paid a really high rent anyways 
 after over a year of this we retaliated 
 conflict <unk> : the previous month 4323 had called in 3 times a day every day so i told the other security guards to pee in a bucket or contribute something <unk> and <unk> to the gag bag '' every time he called and it would be put to good use after 3 days we had enough 
 i was still in college as an engineering major at the time and after enough fluid mechanics and hydraulic lab work i had designed a <unk> revenge machine : basically a giant super-soaker with a .5 '' nozzle powered by compressed gas i used a <unk> tank because it was convenient 
 as security guards we had access to the roof and i already had a vantage point in mind for 
 i had a previously calculated set of tables to make the perfect shot a little bit of <unk> and a partner to help set up the shot and with the pull of the trigger we sent over a gallon of piss fish guts yellow dye and left over indian food through the window and onto their rug without even grazing the window edges all while under the cover of night 
 4323 apparently did n't have any idea what had happened the following morning complaining got them nowhere but they got pegged with the cleaning fine because 4323 could n't prove they did n't make the mess themselves and they were at home at the time which was even more surprising they did not hear a splash after all the noise complaints they made that year 
 tl dr : -guy # 4323 complains too much too long to security guard <unk> guard uses <unk> : makes giant putrid filled super-soaker -guy # 4323 gets fined for cleaning mysterious stinky <unk> stain on rug edit <unk> : for those asking more about the bad baby '' super soaker device : <unk> closest existing <unk> available water gun i can think of to what i used would be the stream machine '' if you can imagine a <unk> gas chamber behind the plunger it also had a main spring in the gas chamber connected to the media divider behind the fluid reservoir but it did n't actually contribute force but <unk> the <unk> of the device 
 <unk> actually was n't the first time i fired this contraption before just the first time i used the equipment off campus off record and using a fluid that was n't entirely water 
 the first time i tried it on a grass lawn on campus i did n't take into account the <unk> impulse <unk> principle : sum of forces = <unk> and the bad baby '' ended up <unk> backwards and shot some of us in the back of the knee with the stream of water 
 this problem was solved by standing on the mounting plate 
 also this contraption was originally part of a lab experiment and occasionally used to <unk> <unk> students to <unk> in engineering 
 <unk> the jet nozzle at the end of the tube was enough to keep the flow <unk> but there was a system of about 40 parallel straws each 2 '' long at the end of the chamber just before the shut off valve before the nozzle similar but not the same as a <unk> 's hose 
 these straws also had the double feature of stopping the plunger before it hit the end of the chamber like a shock <unk> if the shut off valve was left on before the chamber emptied 
 it also means that there was about 1/4 liter of fluid left in the straw and nozzle 
 for those asking why we felt # 4323 deserved the wrath of the bad baby : <unk> was n't just his calling in and complaining he was telling us how to do our job and how to solve problems before they were even a problem on a <unk> scale 
 he often did make phony calls to us about a <unk> in the pool area while we were already watching it this is one of the most selfish things you can do to call security attention to a knowingly false problem and forcing us to leave other areas vulnerable 
 if we were law enforcement he would 've been cited for harassment or false reporting 
 and we were n't the only people troubled by 4323 the management and other residents had growing problems as well 
 management would not act because of money and his making enemies made it harder for him to think of a suspect 
 he also had a bad habit of smoking off the balcony and raining <unk> onto the <unk> area below which we witnesses and did eventually cause comparable level of property damage but 4323 money meant more to the management 
 also last i checked 2 years after this incident and he was still making the same bs calls and complaints and still refused to move to another apartment clearly bitching was his hobby 
 <unk> for the people asking about the distance we used a <unk> triangle to measure the 30 shot 
 30 <unk> <unk> for the literal revenge machine tldr : ex roommate posts craigslist ad for a prostitute with my number and it soon <unk> 
 my roommate we’ll call him sleazebag was engaged to his girlfriend of 3 months 
 since we shared a room whenever we wanted private time we had to make sure the other wasn’t going to be around 
 it was all fine for the first few months but then it got excessive 
 they would text me once a day around 3pm usually when i would finish my last class asking if i could give them <unk> <unk> for a few hours 
 for a while i dealt with it and would go to the gym for a while 
 one day he asked if he could have the room for about 30 minutes which i replied “fine but i do have to study for an exam and need my stuff at some point <unk> well an hour goes by and i decide that it’s been enough time so i go into my room 
 they both yell that they had just started 
 i grabbed my books that were near the door and left 
 that night i get a hate filled text about how “i am the worse roommate <unk> and how i was <unk> their <unk> i just ignored the text and came back to the room when i was done studying 
 he then started doing petty things such as trashing my plastic and foam plates and <unk> putting his trash on my <unk> drawing <unk> on my work 
 well one day i was in my room on my laptop and i hear the two start cracking up 
 sleazebag goes <unk> take a look at <unk> he shows me an ad of craigslist with my phone number posted as a male gay prostitute 
 i tell him to remove the ad and that it wasn’t funny which he insisted was just a prank and that no one would call 
 soon i get a text from some random number 
 so at that point i decide to get some revenge 
 well they had a particular schedule sex every afternoon at 3pm 
 i had remembered there was a way to have two numbers to call each other 
 the number of the <unk> still in my phone because i never delete texts and i decided to have the two call each other 
 well my roommate answered and tried to find out how this guy got his number 
 apparently the man was lonely and had called and texted him multiple times a day usually around 3pm every day 
 well fast forward a year and i run into sleazebag on the bus and he told me how he got a house with his fiancé 
 seeing me reminded him of the ad which i had to report to get it deleted and he sent me a picture of the ad he had <unk> 
 this time though we didn’t share a room so i made an identical ad placed his address and the two numbers that called me i had call him and referred them to the new ad 
 let just say he didn’t find it funny anymore and deleted his ad 
 this happened about 10 years ago when i was still in high school 
 i used to work at a restaurant as a bus boy 
 one particular night a man came in by himself and ordered a pizza and appetizer and a few beers 
 nothing weird about him but it was a slow night and i distinctly remember him because i 'm fairly certain he had come in to dine before 
 he ate his food and left 
 i cleaned the table after he left and as soon as i was finished the waitress who had his table asked me if i accidentally threw his bill and money away 
 now at this point i had been working at the restaurant for 2 years and i always check to make sure there is n't any money or credit card receipt on the table before i throw anything away 
 well the guy had left without paying 
 yeah it sucks and yes the waitress got stiffed on a mediocre tip but it sucks knowing that we probably would never catch the guy because who is dumb enough to come back to a restaurant in which you previously <unk> and <unk> 
 well fast forward 3 weeks 
 it 's another slow night and i notice a familiar face walk in the door 
 he 's by himself and one of the waitresses sits him at a booth 
 now i know for sure that this is the same guy that was in the restaurant 3 weeks prior that left without paying 
 i asked the waitress what he ordered and it was an appetizer and a pizza 
 i told the owner that this guy was the same guy that stiffed the restaurant 3 weeks ago 
 the owner pulled up that old receipt and it was identical to what the guy had just ordered 
 one of the pizza cooks was pretty ghetto looking 
 he had lots of tattoos up and down his arms and had a general mean look on his face most of the time he was actually a very nice guy 
 so the owner told him to go stand by the door in case the guy tried to leave without paying 
 the pizza cook also made a point to not break eye contact with the customer 
 at this point everyone working knew what was going on so occasionally other employees would come to the dining room floor and take a peek at the guy 
 the guy started noticing that the employees were looking at him and he became obviously uncomfortable 
 the manager went to his table and explained that his food was ready but he would have to pay his bill before he received his food she did n't mention his other unpaid bill yet 
 he then requested that his order be to go '' 
 the manager went back and packed up his food 
 meanwhile the guy got up to use the bathroom 
 once he walked toward the bathroom the pizza cook watching the door left his post to go talk to the manager about what was going on 
 the guy saw his opportunity and booked it out of the restaurant 
 the manager and i both saw him leave so she ran out after the guy 
 she caught up to him pretty quick and asked why he left and that he did n't pay his bill 
 he tried to play dumb and said really 
 i thought i left money at the table '' 
 the manager told him no you did n't pay and you also did n't pay for your meal last time you were here '' 
 he then said well i only live a few blocks away i was just running home to go get money to pay for my food '' 
 the manager brought the guy back in and sat him down at the bar then proceeded to call the police 
 the cops showed up a few minutes later and asked the guy why he did n't pay this time or last time 
 the guy <unk> his right to remain silent and was put in hand cuffs and walked out of the restaurant into the back seat of the police car all while the employees and the few customers that were present were all clapping loudly 
 the guy never came back after that 
 tl dr : guy leaves restaurant without paying comes back 3 weeks later and tries to do the same thing 
 gets caught and <unk> an old apartment complex i used to live in i was in a unit on the top floor 
 the walls are rather <unk> but the ceilings and floors <unk> most sound unless you accidentally drop something really listen 
 honestly if you really <unk> you could hear the television show the people downstairs were watching but <unk> were never as <unk> as walls in this complex 
 most downstairs neighbors i had in the 5 years i lived there never complained ... until i had one that did 
 first complaint i had was in the form of a letter from my front office claiming <unk> video game noises and that i had a dog i had neither a console or a dog at this time and that i had to remove the dog and stop playing the console or be evicted and this was my first of two warnings or strikes on my lease 
 i walked right over to the office 
 pointed out since the notice was inside my unit if they saw a console or evidence of a dog 
 woman at the front office <unk> i was right and removed the warning from my file 
 a week later i had a note on my door from downstairs complaining about noise 
 i went down and knocked on the door 
 neighbor didnt bother to answer 
 later on that same week as i was in bed reading no radio or television on i had a cop knocking on my door for a noise complaint 
 i invited the officer in 
 he looked around agreed with me that there was no way any noise was coming from my unit 
 same cop came back twice 
 his last visit he said that he was fed up 
 he agreed that i was doing nothing wrong and that the police will no longer be entertaining any noise complaint reports from my downstairs neighbor 
 he also said the complex told him the same thing 
 next day i found my shoes suddenly felt very very heavy 
 get home got ta make sure there 's no dirt ... stomp stomp stomp 
 cooking 
 need to mince <unk> 
 why mince 
 let 's <unk> with a hammer 
 wham wham wham 
 hmm ya know this television show could use more bass 
 i heard beating on my floor 
 screaming shouting 
 police never came office never bothered me about it 
 i just discovered this <unk> today and am thoroughly enjoying reading all the pro-revenge story 's and thought id share mine 
 anyway getting on with my story this all happened the summer of my sophomore year of high school and the end of my junior year 
 so im walking with my girlfriend at the time and a few of our friends back to my house from our local park in the middle of summer vacation 
 the neighborhood the park is in does n't have <unk> so were walking in the street casually moving out the way as cars need to get past until this k5 blazer <unk> your unfamiliar with them k5 <unk> are basically <unk> where u can take the top off and be left with what i consider a pick up truck with seats in the bed with this obnoxious custom paint job is behind us we move to the side thinking nothing of it until they slowly pull up besides us and 4 guys with squirt guns spray us with god knows what ... <unk> and friends decided we would be better of just not pondering that they then speed off while some of my friends throw rocks and yell and i try to calm down my now crying girlfriend 
 fast forward a couple months after school has started again i realize the d-bags that sprayed us goes to the same school as us after see the obnoxious blazer in the student parking lot and decide to start to <unk> a plan for revenge 
 i wait out the rest of the school year till 2 weeks before our last day of school and its now sufficiently warm for my plan i go to the grocery store buy 2 dozen eggs and 2 gallons of milk and let them sit outside and ferment in the heat so everything was nice and rancid and disgusting perfect to use for revenge for what they had done last year 
 last day of school i skipped my 1st class of the day and what i had thought would be the hardest part of this was actually fairly simple because the d-bags left there window down allowing for easy access to the blazer so i <unk> plaster the insides of the truck with the rotten eggs and then poured the milk all over the seats and floor making sure to get some on the steering wheel walked down the street to ditch the evidence at a nearby convenience store trashcan and went to my 2nd class to let my revenge ferment some more till the end of the day when i gathered all of friends so we can see there <unk> and they were indeed priceless well worth waiting the entire school year to act on my plan 
 the owner of the truck opened the door stared inside and then flipped out while everyone coming out of the school stared and the owners friends trying to help <unk> out the chunks of milk and egg in disgust so satisfying 
 <unk> of the story revenge is best served after <unk> in the sun for 2 weeks 
 also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes its like 4 am and i have not slept <unk> was not especially mean when i was younger but when called upon to <unk> in i could be a little bitch 
 i went to highschool in a small town in the midwest and my <unk> history teacher mrs. smythe had a son who was a senior and stood behind me in choir 
 i 'm incredibly ashamed to admit what i said about her because this woman was one of the kindest most intelligent and supportive teachers i ever had and she was close to <unk> on a very <unk> frame 
 this lady had to use a scooter and <unk> meant for injured students to <unk> the campus just to give you an idea of how the weight <unk> her life 
 so i was just <unk> with some friends in the cafeteria and they started in on just how incredibly fat mrs. smythe was and many many <unk> comments were thrown about 
 i was n't really engaged in what they were saying for the first part but then someone said something about how many people could be fed if she were cut up for meat on a deserted island 
 i made some <unk> remark about how one of her <unk> was the perfect shape and weight of thanksgiving <unk> which for some dumb reason broke everyone up and my comment was passed along to mrs. smythe 's son sometime in the following week 
 i heard smythe jr was <unk> pissed about what i had said but he did n't really do anything other than give me the stink eye from time to time so i thought that 's all there was to it 
 i do n't know what it was that made him choose this particular day to play arson but i think he was probably <unk> over it for a while and finally decided to take revenge 
 i was standing in front of him in choir and i kept feeling some weird <unk> on the back of my neck like someone was blowing on it 
 i was wearing an old black <unk> track jacket with white <unk> that was popular c 2002 - it was probably 70 % <unk> and 30 % <unk> or some shit - but <unk> and <unk> 
 smythe jr was using a cigarette lighter to slowly melt the back of my jacket because the material did n't catch fire for very long like fabric but melted like plastic ... i began to smell a very odd burning <unk> and turned around to see little smythe casually toss a lighter down through the <unk> we were on into the abandoned orchestra pit below 
 <unk> 
 the entire back of my jacket had burned up to my shoulder blades and was <unk> with my shirt underneath 
 when everyone realized what was happening they were all hysterical with laughter cause if i wanted to have a <unk> upper body for the rest of the day i was going to have to walk around looking like a train crash <unk> : / - moral : do n't talk shit cause it will always come back around to give you light chemical burns 
 <unk> <unk> : dr : bully hits me from <unk> 6th grade 
 i start my long-term revenge in 5th grade culminating in a short fight and a bloody nose 
 some backstory : i was born in korea moved to the southern us until the beginning of 3rd grade and moved to the northeast for 3rd grade <unk> 
 the school i attended in the south was a more or less a <unk> 
 <unk> loved their children and confrontation rarely occurred between kids 
 so when i learned i would move to a different place it was extremely hard for me to handle 
 <unk> myself into the new school in the north was n't easy primarily because none of my classmates wanted to spend time with me or associate with me 
 this is how i spent most of my elementary to middle school years 
 the schools in my area were all elementary + middle schools put together however there was one chinese boy who showed interest in me and we started a <unk> relationship 
 unfortunately this child was kind of an angry child and having no one else to take out his anger on often acted physically violent towards me 
 it started off as simple pushing shoving and taking balls away at recess 
 it progressed through tripping into holding me down and then into kicking me in the legs and punching my stomach 
 of course i told many teachers and other staff members about what was happening 
 unfortunately nothing got fixed because there 's only so much teachers can do when an angry chinese lady is screaming about how her son is sensitive and that <unk> was the problem child i had to sit through that meeting 
 i actually so uncomfortable that i asked my principal if i could be excused to go home 
 by 5th grade this bullying had peaked at one moment where we were in art class finishing up our <unk> that we had been working on 
 we had just finished <unk> them and were getting ready to paint 
 he comes to sit with me to paint and before i can get a brush in my hand he picks up my jar about <unk> and proceeds to swing it and connect with my jaw 
 he then opens the window and throws it outside <unk> but chipped 
 our art teacher was an <unk> man in his late 40s at that time and he was n't having any of it 
 he yelled at the chinese boy sent him to the principal 's office and sat down with me in the corner of the room 
 i do n't recall crying but i 'm sure i was 
 and i 'll never forget what he said 
 in his soft voice he told me that he 'd been seeing this happen to me and none of the other kids intervene 
 he told me that i would have to take my stand and make sure that kid never even comes close to thinking about coming after me again '' 
 i understood this was n't something to tell other teachers about or my parents 
 my revenge started off quietly 
 his missing <unk> were found in the art sink a complete <unk> mess his <unk> bought with parent money used in music time was filled with glue his homework would end up missing he got <unk> for the assignment ... oops his backpack once ended up <unk> filled with pinecones and wet leaves while his books and pencils ended up <unk> in dirt 
 i noticed that he <unk> got more frustrated with what was happening that he started to redirect his anger towards me 
 so 
 the beginning of the school year in 6th grade he came over during recess to push me over step on me etc 
 he never got a chance to 
 the second he came over 
 i threw a ball at point blank range at his face 
 it connected and threw him off his balance 
 <unk> his balance he tried to retaliate by kicking 
 his foot connects with my shin while my tiny fist connects with his nose 
 i had never seen so much blood come out of one <unk> of the human body 
 to this day i have n't seen that much blood in one place since the great blood <unk> from the chinese boy 's nose 
 he starts crying teachers <unk> us to the principal 's office conveniently located next to the nurse 's office 
 i tell our principal that he got what he deserved because i put all the <unk> he gave me since 3rd grade into one big punch '' 
 i was sent home but not suspended 
 parents not angry but worried about me and what would come of it 
 chinese mother calls my parents to make me apologize 
 my dad takes the receiver out of my mom 's hand and hangs up on her 
 i went back to school the next day 
 but the chinese boy did n't 
 when he finally did return after a few days he still had a swollen nose 
 he did n't talk to me or interact with me for the rest of our middle-school time together and he moved on to a different high school 
 so when i was younger and living at home my parents got me to do chores which was no big deal except i really hated mowing the grass because i essentially felt like crap for the next 48 hours 
 this is despite my doctor warning my parents of my <unk> and <unk> them to not to let me do it or let me be outside while its being mowed 
 but my parents still make me do it and i have to <unk> my teeth and sneeze my way around the yard 
 one day my parents leave to go for a walk with my sister 
 i 'm kinda ticked because i would much rather be going for a walk than to sneeze my brains out mowing grass 
 so as i finish up mowing the yard just as they come back with ice cream in hand 
 none for me apparently ... they now are going to go to the mall and do some shopping and offer for me to come along 
 i ask if they would wait for me to have a shower and possibly stop for ice cream so i could have some too 
 nope they ca n't wait for me to have a shower and they would n't stop for ice cream anyways ... so they leave me behind again 
 i pull out the fertilizer spreader and large bag of fertilizer 
 i know approximately <unk> of a bag is the usual amount i am told to use for our size of yard so i load the rest of the bag about 3/4 of it into the spreader and proceed to spread <unk> in the yard 
 i then found the round up '' plant killer and loaded that up in our <unk> 
 this is the stuff that we used to kill grass around the shed and around the deck to stop the grass from growing 
 i sprayed an even light coat through the middle of the yard 
 guess who did n't have to <unk> the grass for the rest of the year 
 our grass was like straw for the rest of the summer and even the next year it grew back very thin 
 **tl dr** i was allergic to grass parents made me <unk> the yard even though doctors said i was too allergic 
 one day my parents take my sister to get ice cream and go to the mall without me so i get revenge by over <unk> and spraying plant grass killer through the yard 
 **edit : ** fixed <unk> <unk> <unk> note : ** i was 12 or 13 when i did this 
 i know very well how immature i was at that age 
 thanks for letting me <unk> i can <unk> to a coworker when he quit several years ago at my old job 
 he was for the most part a <unk> useless kid not worthy of any job that was n't <unk> 
 he eventually quit in search of better employment and that 's when it happened 
 he had been there for 2 years without promotion and decided it was time 
 the owner and his wife were <unk> old fucks who treated many of the staff like shit personal <unk> to do their bidding at their small mechanical company 
 when let 's call him rick quit they decided to ride his ass because that was their <unk> 
 treat you like shit normally 
 quit 
 make sure you know you 're a piece of shit 
 they laid into rick ever chance they got 
 being the company <unk> he was all over the place doing different tasks and could often be unsupervised for lengths of time 
 they should have known better and either paid him out or had him do <unk> work for his last 2 weeks 
 we had a problem on a hot summer friday around 10am 
 the <unk> in the main building were backing up 
 the main drain in the shop was n't <unk> and neither were the toilets or the sinks 
 everyone was annoyed 
 one of the guys in the tool shop came over to the main building to complain that the same thing was going on there too 
 main drains toilets etc 
 all backing up 
 shit was actually backing up onto the floors 
 they call a plumber to come out and bring a vac truck too 
 after a few hours of work they get us up and running again 
 next week the same damn thing happens again 
 shit backing up everywhere 
 call the plumber again 
 they roll out to get us going again 
 different crew this time 
 the guy tells us we have a bigger problem with the sewage lines and need to call the city 
 we get a crew from the city the next day 
 they come out with snakes and cameras 
 the problem is bigger than they figured 
 major blockage 
 gon na need to dig up the lines and do some major work 
 two days later a twelve man crew including a fucking <unk> and they start digging 
 they dig through asphalt to get town to the lines 
 the big boss is out there acting like he 's awesome and inspecting all the work as they go 
 the foreman informs the boss that there is a piece of plastic stuck in the pipes but that 's only at the head of the blockage 
 **what it was <unk> in place was reams and reams of paper towel shit and other sewage 
 i mean more paper towel that is in stock at costco is stuck in there 
 ** the boss <unk> his mind 
 it 's the fucking staff '' 
 what happened : rick had enough 
 he would disappear and for 90 min each day he was flushing roll after roll of paper towel down the drain 
 he 'd been at if for months 
 **edit : tl dr- <unk> employee <unk> <unk> amounts of paper towel down the drain leading to a sewer blockage followed by shit flooding and eventual sewage line excavation costing thousands probably 10-15 thousand of work to the city all bc the boss treated him like a piece of shit for a couple years 
 <unk> 10 years ago i was working a summer job as a lifeguard at a beach a few hours from my home town 
 i moved out of the awful employee housing when i got lucky and found a little house 1 bedroom 1.5 bathroom with a loft for the low low cost of $ <unk> 
 now to keep the costs down after the first month i rented some space to a three other <unk> a college age bulgarian girl who was super nice and a great roommate and a set of 19 year old twins from ohio or something who were two of the worst people i have ever met 
 the loft is by far the largest room in the house literally covering the entire <unk> of the building so i take that as my bedroom the bulgarian gets the other bedroom and the twins get the couches in the living room 
 they did your run of the mill roommate bs paying rent late stealing food leaving food out until our kitchen was overrun with <unk> 
 i also have reason to believe that they <unk> a break in and stole laptops and cameras from the bulgarian and i but this goes far beyond that they were really shitty people 
 i routinely found myself preventing them from doing what could only be called date rape or just plain rape 
 they would brag about getting girls drunk fucking them then stealing <unk> out of the girls purses real scumbag stuff there was a lifeguard party at another house and one of the twins got caught in a back room with his hand up a passed out girl 's skirt and would have gotten beat down for it if he had n't ran out the back door 
 the other twin decided to fight one of my friends in my front yard 
 i stepped in to break up the fight and was pushing my friend in to my car when the twin saw an opportunity to punch me in the back of my head when i was n't looking 
 i really regret driving my friend home instead of beating this kid down for the sucker punch but i honestly think he did more damage to his own knuckles than to me 
 so i 'm stuck with these two for the summer and that sucks balls but i 'm making the best of it 
 specifically i 'm charging the twins $ 300 each a month for rent for the two living room couches and the bulgarian pays me $ 400 for a private room 
 the twins cover rent the bulgarian covers electric and the leftovers go in my pocket 
 the only downside is that i have to play landlord to all three 
 before you judge me realize that they were still getting a pretty good deal living with me this house is two blocks from the ocean and on average rooms are going for $ <unk> also i was the only one with my name on the lease so i was assuming any liability 
 anyway the summer drags on all my friends go back to school and at this point it 's a few random <unk> the twins and myself working the beach in the <unk> 
 there is a small community college just down the road from the beach so at the end of the season there is an influx of freshman girls out on the beach <unk> 
 the twins <unk> are at an all time high after getting heaps of phone numbers from naive children and they decide they want to throw a party 
 being the only one over 21 they ask me to get a keg 
 i agree but under the condition that they pay for the keg deposit and tap 
 the night of the party comes and they are <unk> to tap the keg but i convince them to hold off until all the girls they invited start showing up 
 it turned out pretty much exactly as i expected not one person showed up 
 not even free beer could get people to hang out with these kids 
 we clear out the fridge and put the keg in it so it will be cold tomorrow night when people come over '' 
 i wake up the next morning for my day off and the twins head off to work 
 halfway through my morning routine i start thinking about all the bullshit these kids have pulled over the course of the summer and i come up with a plan 
 i call up my supervisor at the lifeguard agency we talk for while and agree that they do n't have any real need for me until next summer 
 i walk across the street to my landlords house and tell him that i 'll be leaving a week early and ask him if he could come <unk> the house for my security deposit before i leave 
 my landlord shows up just as i finish packing all my stuff into my car he checks out the house and gives me my deposit back in cash 
 i tell him the twins are staying and that any future rent or damage will be their responsibility he 's a pretty laid back guy so he agrees 
 he 's about to leave when i say hey man can you help me out with something '' 
 i tell him about the twin 's failed party and suggest that a keg of beer is far more than they know what to do with 
 he has a good laugh and the two of us unload the keg from the fridge and load it into my trunk 
 there were a couple cases of beer as well i give those to my landlord for his help 
 i 'm just about to leave for good when i notice an opportunity for a cherry on top 
 there is one lone <unk> one of those <unk> coronas they put in <unk> sitting unopened on the counter 
 i take it and carefully put it in the empty fridge right where the keg used to be ca n't leave the twins completely empty handed 
 i lock my old house for the last time give my key to the landlord and start calling my friends in my home town to tell them that we are having a <unk> 
 two hours into my ride home i get a call from one of the twins 
 he went through all five stages of grief during our short conversation 
 denial : you did n't take the keg did you '' 
 anger : you stole our keg motherfucker i 'll kick your ass '' 
 <unk> : bring back our keg or i 'll call the cops good luck dickhead the deposit is in my name '' 
 depression : we are having girls over tonight how will we be able to fuck them without alcohol '' and finally acceptance : fuck you keep it '' 
 a few hours later i 'm drinking to victory with my home town friends 
 tl dr : lived with a couple of scumbags for the summer got free beer 
 my dad was a great guy 
 pretty laid back but <unk> with <unk> <unk> skills 
 he took everything in <unk> until you crossed him 
 this is a tale about one of the poor souls who did 
 my dad lived across the street from a guy who worked in the same mill as dad so he would give dad a ride to and from work and come over when there was nothing else going on just to hang out 
 drank dad 's beer ate dad 's snacks what have you 
 anyway dad quite loudly questioned a company policy that disregarded a state holiday and they canned him 
 dad was annoyed but figured that 's how things work sometimes and took the unemployment comp happily 
 he went and informed the guy that he would n't need a ride that afternoon because he had been <unk> 
 the guy made a weird face and said that was fine 
 dad made a mental note of the weird look and went home to start his vacation '' 
 anyway dad had been outside playing with my nephew when the guy got home 
 dad gave him a friendly wave 
 it was not returned 
 in fact the guy did n't even look in his direction 
 dad figured maybe something else had happened at work that day that was <unk> and blew it off as nothing 
 but the next day he did n't wave again 
 just locked his car up and <unk> into his house like he was n't even there 
 so the day after that dad called to him and was once again ignored 
 dad was starting to get pretty miffed at this point 
 why was this guy being such a dick now 
 because they did n't work at the same place anymore 
 that 's dumb as hell 
 after a few days of this dad actually went up to his car and tried to talk to him but alas he was still ignoring him 
 with the numerous <unk> wearing on his mind dad came up with his revenge 
 you see dad was a drinker 
 not a violent mean drinker but a daily <unk> guy 
 and so was the guy across the street 
 so much so that he always had a few beers on the way to work 
 at seven in the morning while driving 
 dad never said anything because he grew up during a time when you could drink a bottle of whiskey while driving and the only thing someone would say to you was to not throw it out the window 
 but he was definitely going to say something now 
 about an hour before the guy left for work dad called the <unk> police line 
 he told them that there would be someone leaving their house at five of seven not only with a buzz on but with a beer in their lap while driving 
 he told them where he was leaving from and what direction he was going in 
 the <unk> asked him if he was serious and dad said and i quote like fucking cancer '' 
 at ten to seven dad sat at the kitchen table and waited to see if anything would come of his little tip 
 he saw the guy come out of his house with a few beers right on time 
 he heard the car start up saw him pull out of his parking space ... and then heard a <unk> whoop twice 
 dad smiled and went out on the front <unk> to watch the show 
 and it was a pretty good one too 
 apparently the guy had been busted for dui a few times so he was instantly arrested the car was impounded and he never saw the guy again 
 one time when he was recounting the story to my sister 's friend i laughed and said dad you 're a snitch '' 
 he looked over at me shrugged and said he should have just said <unk> 
 note : this story was set in a time when employment laws in my area were ridiculously lax ... so new zealand in the 1990s 
 my family comes from a small town the sort where people parking in the middle of the street to have a conversation with you is so natural an occurrence that the locals just drive around the parked car 
 <unk> bless them think the hold up is only going to be a second or so 
 they could not be more mistaken 
 so laid back but not <unk> dead 
 things do move but at a slower pace than other places 
 my mum goes into about the only chain store this town had at the time a place that sells clothes toys beauty products etc 
 she gets what she needs and goes to the counter there is only one 
 the cashier is just standing there chatting to her friend 
 hello '' 
 hang on '' 
 she continues talking to her friend behind the counter 
 mum wants a minute 
 and another 
 and another 
 and another 
 and another 
 eventually mum walks away hangs her items on the <unk> and then disappears to the back of the store 
 all the while the cashier remains chatting to her friend behind the counter 
 mum eventually returns to the cashier counter and yes she 's still busy chatting but without the assortment of garments she was <unk> on purchasing 
 rather the store manager 
 oh and she knew the store manager 
 did i mention this was a small town 
 so what 's been the problem '' 
 i was waiting here for five minutes 
 she just kept talking '' 
 now i should remind you this is a laid back town 
 but there 's a difference between a few seconds wait for someone to finish their sentence and having someone arrogantly tell you to wait for five whole minutes 
 oh dear 
 what would you like me to do about it '' 
 fire her '' 
 suddenly the cashier broke out from her conversation 
 what 
 you ca n't ask for him to fire me 
 you should have just waited '' 
 i know another girl who would be perfectly happy to take your job she needs the money 
 plus she 'd actually be capable of serving customers '' mum replies 
 okay <unk> 's mum 's name here 
 cashier you finish in two weeks 
 now serve this customer now and you cashier 's friend can leave the store '' 
 i ca n't remember if mum got a discount or a free gift but i do remember the firing 
 tldr arrogant cashier does n't serve customer for five minutes gets fired by annoyed customer 's request 
 edit : clarified language in response to <unk> thanks 
 i always try to remove <unk> 
 i just could n't see it <unk> 've never shared this story with anyone 
 when i was 11 i was pretty <unk> 
 i was n't bullied or anything just generally quiet and <unk> 
 in my art class i sat next to a girl who was both pretty and very annoying -- she was giggly and <unk> all the time 
 still she had a lot of friends while i mostly kept to myself 
 i ca n't remember how it started but she would <unk> the erasers from my pencils 
 she thought it was hilarious and other people did too 
 i had a mechanical pencil she stole it took the eraser out and ate it cracking up laughing 
 the first time i just shrugged it off 
 but a mechanical pencil without an eraser is annoying 
 if i used a wooden pencil same thing -- she 'd chew it off 
 and we were in the middle of doing <unk> so i really needed a pencil and erase 
 so when she ate my eraser the next day and the next and every time i got a new pencil or an eraser i was getting really sick of it 
 i asked her to stop and she just laughed at me 
 everybody would always <unk> her to do it 
 she did it until i had no erasers left and she thought it was so fucking funny 
 thinking back now i should 've just told a teacher -- but i did n't want anyone to think i was a <unk> baby telling on people so i took my own personal revenge 
 for christmas i asked for one of those long eraser pens the one where an eraser shaped almost like string cheese goes inside a plastic container and is pushed out as it 's used 
 i got one with several replacement erasers 
 i took one of them put it in the bath tub and peed on it 
 i let it dry and put it in the pen 
 i knew she would take care of the rest 
 sure enough when school started back up and i pulled my eraser pen out in art class she said oh is that my christmas present '' 
 giggling she snatched it from me pulled the eraser out and started chewing on 
 i just smiled and watched her <unk> the whole thing 
 maybe she finally got her fill of erasers seriously why was she eating them in the first place 
 or maybe that one put her off erasers forever because she never stole another eraser from <unk> used to have a couple living next to my parents house who were very noisy 
 they 'd usually invite people over for parties and stay up long in to the night with fairly loud music playing 
 in summers they 'd host their parties in their garden which was overlooked by most of our house 's bedrooms and they 'd be laughing and shouting really loud 
 this went on for about a year 
 my dad had tried to talk to them several times and they 'd always promise to be quiet next time but next time would just be the same shit all over again 
 so i decided with my brother to carry out our revenge plan 
 our neighbours had recently bought a brand new pick-up truck for which they were very proud from what we could gather 
 we used our garden hose to make mud out of a field opposite our house and then took that mud and coated the pick-up truck with it 
 we used my dad 's tools to even it out basically a couple of wood <unk> that are used on fresh cement to make its surface all smooth and even and after a couple hours we had managed to create a big block of mud around the pick-up truck 
 we wrote on it : <unk> : '' we went back in took showers and later that night our furious neighbours came over to ask us if we saw anybody messing with their pick-up truck 
 they did n't suspect us outright because nearly everybody in the <unk> was asking them to keep quiet to the extend that some people had called the police on them a couple time 
 but they knew why it had happened and needless to say they mostly kept quiet after <unk> happened last year on christmas day 
 my wife and i were visiting her brother for christmas and after all of the <unk> were done we wanted to eat 
 they did not really feel like cooking so we found out that mcdonald 's was open 
 well after we pulled up to the glorious double <unk> of gold 
 we went inside and ordered our food 
 they were super busy and the wait times were pretty bad 
 i offered to wait for the food since my brother in law had his three daughters that wanted to play in the <unk> 
 as i was waiting i kept noticing a lot of ice on the floor 
 as i continued waiting i noticed it was two teenage girls throwing the ice about 17 & amp 14 years old 
 they were giggling and carrying on 
 i ignored it until one pelted me in the head 
 i got my food and as i walked by and looked them dead in the eyes quit throwing the fucking ice '' 
 they stopped 
 we enjoyed our meal and time together 
 as i was leaving we filled our drinks up and left 
 as we were walking to the cars 
 the two girls from pulled up to me in a mustang 
 the younger one leaned her head out the passenger window and said sorry about the fucking ice '' 
 my sister-in-law without even giving me a chance sorry about the fucking ice bitch '' 
 and <unk> her large soda right in the girls face 
 they both drive away with the girl in screaming tears 
 we laughed about it the entire night 
 **tl dr : teenage girls being bitches got a face full of soda 
 <unk> i have a story of my shitty room-mate from 2 years ago 
 it was too pro for pettyrevenge so here it is 
 also its long hang in there 
 background on room-mate : my piece of shit room mate pos from here on out was horrible 
 he was going to college for no reason and was on a full ride through financial aid and bragged constantly about it 
 the problem with that is his parents are millionaires and he makes a shit ton of money showing cattle while i am white and squarely middle class and get only $ 500 per year in financial aid while paying out of pocket and with loans 
 he also bought a brand new $ <unk> truck while in college because he doesnt have to pay a cent for his college education just to give you an example 
 well he gets shit grades cheats on every assignment and test and parties nightly especially on thirsty thursday '' being an engineering student i dont understand this tradition as i <unk> the time for it 
 he comes home black out drunk at 2 in the morning and is extremely loud like windows shaking loud 
 he also drives in that condition 
 he is also a huge douche with house keep up 
 will not provide paper products at all i started hiding my tp as he 'll go through a jumbo roll per day will not clean and generally makes a huge mess 
 he is also very abusive to his gf 
 i could go on but nah you get the picture 
 the offense : he was so shitty to everyone all the time this was just the straw that broke the camel 's back 
 i and the other tenants 3 of us picked a weekend to clean the house 
 everyone agreed even pos did 
 then halfway through the week pos informs us that hell be leaving for the weekend so wont be able to clean third time this has happened 
 he has also filled except for one shelf our <unk> fridge only one in the house with shitty beer 
 he also decides to thaw raw meat not on a plate and wrapped in nothing but a paper wrapping on top of all of our he 3 other tenants food it obviously leaked through the paper and got all over our food and the fridge 
 we tell him to remove the beer before he leaves and to clean his shit up and replace our food that has been contaminated with raw meat 
 we remind him almost hourly of his for the rest of the week 
 friday comes around and by the time the rest of us get back from class pos is gone 
 he has done nothing 
 we were pissed 
 the revenge : we cleaned the house that weekend anyway 
 we also took the <unk> meat from the fridge and since his truck was still there his gf drove that weekend we grabbed his spare keys and spread that shit all over the engine 
 have fun when that puppy <unk> up 
 we then removed the beer 80 something cans from the fridge and set it in our yard with a sign free beer '' and waited 
 3/4 of the beer was gone by that night so we took the rest of it back inside and shook the shit out of every single can then hid them all over the house 
 we also replaced his pillow with cans of beer since he launches himself onto his bed 
 we then wait 
 pos returns and being the definition of stupid doesnt notice anything 
 goes to his room and <unk> onto his bed thunk what the fuck 
 why is there beer in my pillow '' 
 we are dying laughing but manage to keep it quiet 
 he <unk> us about it and we just tell him he should have moved his beer and not ditched cleaning he never noticed most of it was missing 
 he was pissed as his tiny brain couldnt register hat he was supposed to clean too and in general pitch <unk> not be a douche 
 then came the kicker 
 throughout the week he kept complaining that his truck smelled awful and he <unk> figure it out 
 well that thursday he went out to get blasted again 
 we threw the free beer sign into the back of his truck with his beer 
 2 in the morning rolls around and he busts through the door again near black out drunk bitching about how some nigger stole my beer '' 
 oh i forgot to say he was also under age at the time 
 he then leaves to go to his gf 's house driving himself again while drunk so we call into the cops <unk> his truck description and where hes headed as were sick of dealing with drunk pos and him <unk> everyone else in the town 
 he gets busted blows a ridiculously high bac and gets dui and an underage 
 the college drops his financial aid and he has to <unk> his truck to pay for college 
 justice is served <unk> 
 now you get to live like the rest of us <unk> 
 thanks for reading edit : to whoever ends up having to clean the engine bay on the truck i am so sorry 
 edit 2 : he also ruined the <unk> bearing on the clutch in my car 18 year old manual <unk> <unk> was getting <unk> 
 he had to move it after i parked it at the very end of the single file driveway just after the sidewalk as he was apt to do to show him how annoying it was 
 instead of asking me to move it he stole my keys never put them back where they were 
 took 2 days to find them and dropped a big cement block on my clutch to hold it in moved the car and then left the block there for 2 days 
 prolonged pressure on the clutch pedal <unk> the <unk> 
 bitch to fix 
 alternative title : the year i lost my fucking mind and turned into a psycho bitch this story takes place over the course of 2 years with a person i think is probably a <unk> or has a <unk> 
 it first began when i was <unk> i met derrick when he was 17 in the hallway waiting for my mom to pick me up because i was sick 
 we started talking and he offered to take me home in his truck because i looked as if i was going to pass out 
 on that ride home i fell head over heels for him 
 he was good looking we had similar interests and he seemed to like me back 
 now to give you some clarity i had never had a boyfriend before this 
 i kissed my best friend in elementary school because of a coin flip but i never did anything with anyone up until this time 
 before derrick i was as nonsexual as you can be 
 however i was a hopeless romantic and a lonely nerd in a school where i did n't feel like i fit in 
 i had 1 friend and i was n't allowed to talk to her because of my parents 
 this probably explains why i was as easily manipulated as i was 
 derrick was a senior in high school yet he focused a lot of attention on me 
 he made me a little mascot of the senior class and i made a lot of friends this way 
 we also took the same math class at the time college algebra 
 he would convince me to do both of our homework so he could finally pass the class 
 in my <unk> i agreed making sure to change my handwriting and give him some wrong answers 
 i was the nerd so this was nothing new to me 
 plus i wanted to keep him around 
 he asked me out 2 months after we met 
 this is where everything started going bad 
 first derrick started trying to control how i looked 
 he hated my short hair 
 i would pull my bangs back in <unk> and put on a heavy amount of make-up but he would still comment on how he felt he was with a 10 year old boy 
 he would n't talk to me if i wore the color yellow 
 he also made fun of my size 
 i was small i 'm still small to this day and i hardly had any breasts to speak of 
 my mother bought my clothing and she would buy plain color low cut shirts simply because they were the only ones we could get cheaply 
 one day while hanging out behind the school with his friends he yanked down my shirt by the collar showing all his friends my small breasts 
 he yelled at them well at least your girlfriends have <unk> '' 
 his friends after that would call me the <unk> wonder which would then spread around the high school for the rest of my high school days until i broke down and got a <unk> but that 's another story 
 he would also call me asian and make <unk> noises at me 
 i have <unk> eyes yes but i am not asian 
 i called him out on his bullshit there but that also spread around to the point where i quit my job last year because a girl from high school harassed me about it 
 now remember how i said i was nonsexual 
 he was <unk> 
 derrick would give me rides in his truck and during those rides he would ask for a kiss a french kiss 
 i agreed thinking no harm no foul 
 then it escalated 
 he would stick his hands down my pants feel me up as we kissed 
 i was uncomfortable and i would usually tell him no until i broke down 
 then he wanted me to touch him primarily on his penis 
 i told him no and he threatened to throw me out of the car while he was driving 
 he threatened to leave me for sarah a cheerleader and band geek 
 i finally agreed 
 nothing at that time went further than touching but i was highly uncomfortable 
 he graduated that year and we stopped talking 
 then two years later when i was 16 and he was 20 i found him again 
 we <unk> and i thought he had changed a lot 
 i was right in a way 
 he was a lot worse 
 derrick lived a trailer park by the high school so i would go over there for a couple hours every day just to be with him 
 i never lost that head over heels factor for him 
 those days my hair was longer and i dressed a little more girly 
 he would tell me to straighten my hair how to do my make-up call me ugly tell me how flat i was how i could never find anyone who would really like me like he did 
 he would sometimes tell me that he hated me and he would rather be with anyone else but me 
 i lost a lot of the confidence i had 
 i was n't a loner anymore 
 he came between my friends 
 when my best friend passed in december due to suicide he would n't let me go to the funeral because they were a faggot '' and they deserved to die 
 he threatened to leave me then 
 by then i was broken enough to believe him 
 of course there came the sex 
 i was still fairly nonsexual but he would force himself upon me 
 it started with <unk> which i thought it would stop there 
 then one day out of nowhere he forced himself in my mouth 
 i nearly clamped down using my teeth but he shoved himself so far in that i vomited all over him 
 he pulled out and told me to do it again 
 this is also the person who took my virginity and told me how shitty i was at sex 
 one day i was on facebook and i saw a picture of him kissing another girl sarah the cheerleader 
 i <unk> her and i started going through pictures 
 they had been dating for 3 years longer than i have been in the picture 
 everything slowly began to click in my head the sex the weird hours the fact he never took me out the calling me baby '' and honey '' 
 and then i got mad 
 that night i went over to his house 
 we had sex that night and then he went to sleep 
 he had two cars his truck and a dodge challenger 
 he was in the middle of <unk> that challenger and it was beginning to look pretty 
 i usually sat with him while he was fixing them so i knew somewhat what i was doing 
 i grabbed the bat he kept and smashed the windshield of that challenger with as much force as i could 
 i kept smashing it until it was almost gone 
 i smashed all the lights 
 i poured a monster energy drink where the oil goes 
 any sort of wires or <unk> i saw i ripped up 
 i went to the inside and i ripped his dashboard and threw it in the back 
 i ripped the leather seats he had just installed with a <unk> knife and then poured another energy drink on the foam 
 i ripped up the leather on the steering wheel writing the word pedo '' on it 
 i destroyed the carpet with his soda and poured some on the radio 
 i shoved a can underneath the brake pedal 
 i broke the bat on his truck 
 i smashed everything i could there 
 i did the same thing i did with the challenger 
 i poured his <unk> in the oil 
 i poured it three cans in his gas tank 
 i smeared dog shit from his dog shit bucket all over the inside the carpet the steering wheel the seats the <unk> 
 i smashed every window every light and attacked the body until the bat broke in half 
 then i punched it so hard i broke my hand 
 i <unk> along the side of the truck cheater liar asshole dick pedo '' 
 i broke the back of the <unk> or whatever you call it so he could not haul anything around 
 i loosened his tires hoping they would fall off 
 then i grabbed all his tools and shoved them in the neighbor 's trash can 
 i also took his sets of keys and chucked them down the street 
 i blocked his number and walked home that day 
 while i was at home i sent every picture i had of derrick and me and sent it to sarah 
 she was n't going to leave him she was pregnant but i hoped to warn her 
 i also called his job and let his boss know that he was seeing a girl that was underage 
 i do n't know exactly what happened after that point 
 i broke off all contact with him 
 i do know he married sarah and they have a little girl together 
 it 's a small town so i do see him on occasion at my job 
 he pretends not to know me 
 i 'm perfectly happy with that 
 tl dr : i got fed up with a manipulative asshole so i became a crazy ex 
 first time poster long time lurker 
 this could be pettyrevenge but i 'll give my justifications afterwards 
 and this is just one of probably many stories to come 
 for those who know and this is going through your head based on the title i like you already 
 so there i was on my birthday at the stroke of midnight just given a 3/4 day of paid time off from my <unk> shitty job working 3rd shift at a factory 
 i think to myself awesome 
 i 'll go home and <unk> get myself a birthday blowjob 
 i mean i 've been dating her for the past 6 years and have gotten one every year for my birthday 
 but there 's always the chance i wo n't 
 no big deal 
 i walk in the door all is quiet 
 which instantly strikes me as kind of strange she usually watches tv at this time of night 
 maybe she just passed out 
 i think nothing of it 
 so i am walking back to our bedroom when i hear it 
 the <unk> headboard against the wall with slight barely audible <unk> moans coming from the bedroom and promptly <unk> after a few seconds i quietly sit down on the cold linoleum floor and think to myself ... she 's cheating on me on my birthday on our bed in the house that i pay rent 
 wtf '' 
 but there 's one thing that everyone who knows me knows about me 
 i do n't act <unk> 
 ever 
 i think things through and you really do n't want to get on my revenge side 
 it 's cold and it 's calculating ... i have been referred to as <unk> on a number of occasions 
 so the plan is hatched for the instant revenge 
 she only likes to bang in the dark 
 i have really good dark vision 
 she does not 
 the house is pitch black 
 i 've got this '' i mutter to myself 
 i quietly enter the bedroom and proceed to head to the always open closet across from the bed and proceed to grab our wooden studded paddle from it 
 he 's still on top of her continuing to go at it with a <unk> <unk> pace 
 it is everything in my power to hold back my <unk> with the situation ... i grab the paddle and a box that was on top of it proceeds to fall making a very loud noise 
 i crouch down to stay hidden and think to myself shit here i am catching her cheating on me and i 'm about to be the one that gets caught ... '' but ... they do n't stop 
 he 's a madman on a mission to blow his load which he 's obviously very close to doing 
 i get to the end of the bed and stand there in full batters swing ready waiting for the right moment 
 it was was quite an eternity waiting for a man that is screwing my girlfriend of six years on my bed in my house on my birthday to blow his load 
 and then it happens 
 he pulls out and is about to pop on her stomach 
 i instantly realize she 's doing this <unk> and i spring out the full swing now with added hatred of <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 ** that blood <unk> <unk> and then eventual cry was absolute music to my ears 
 direct hit to the ass 
 she asks what in the hell just happened 
 his reply is something just smacked my ass so hard i think i 'm bleeding ... '' this is when i personally think it hit her 
 she frantically rushes to the side of the bed to flick on the <unk> lamp 
 <unk> and there i am standing there tall and proud 
 safety glasses still on holding what i have now dubbed the meat <unk> in hand 
 staring down at the both of them with an <unk> <unk> gaze that is commonly referred to as the <unk> 
 stare 
 a stare of <unk> <unk> inducing soul destruction 
 <unk> in its <unk> 
 and then i focus my gaze directly into his eyes 
 calm as a <unk> and officially shut down of all emotions by this point 
 it is now that i realize that the man screwing her was a man that i 've known for years 
 not necessarily a friend but someone whom i trusted and knew i trusted 
 and then i say in an extremely <unk> and overtly <unk> gay tone 
 who 's up for a <unk> '' 
 with an evil <unk> grin afterwards i have never seen a man get his shit and get out the door so fast in my life 
 ever 
 it was per near <unk> that he was gone 
 she looks at me 
 i look at her 
 and i say the inevitable truth 
 you know that every single one of my past girlfriends has cheated on me and you know exactly what that means ... '' i 'm dead to you huh ... '' she replies in a <unk> <unk> voice of <unk> 
 after you leave tonight i will not recognize either of your existence if we meet again ... i will more than likely never speak to you '' 
 while standing there staring at her the whole time she gets up head hanging in shame 
 <unk> clothes 
 gets in her car and leaves 
 that 's when everything in me just <unk> 
 my heart my soul my emotions my ego and pride ... everything 
 i proceed to go to the living room crack a beer and cry for 8 hours 
 i 'm a man but i 'm only human 
 the next day her mom calls me up and asks what in the hell happened last night '' 
 so i reply bluntly with this ... **tl dr i discovered her sleeping with a someone i knew snuck into the room and proceeded to slap his ass as hard as i <unk> could with our wooden studded paddle as he was coming on her stomach ... ** '' she busts out laughing at her daughters stupidity and my retaliation and heads on over for a little bit more of a talk instead of on the phone 
 i still talk with her mom once in a while 
 i think i might call her tomorrow 
 but have n't said a word to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> since 
 after the fact i learned that he was not the only she cheated on me with either ... i genuinely wish her nothing but the best and no ill will 
 she just wo n't be getting a single damn thing from me ... from what i understand she has n't been able to hold a job since and is with that guy 
 huge <unk> to boot i will say i 'm still <unk> about everything even nearly 2 years later now 
 i 've been torn up entirely too much by women and i just want that cycle to end 
 i 'm taking my sweet ass time with getting back into the dating world 
 sure it 's lonely sometimes 
 but i 'd rather be lonely then 10 years down the road at 40 and having this crap repeat all over again ... reasons i figured this was pro over petty : swift <unk> thought out and planned j uses butt <unk> ... it 's super effective 
 not a rash i 'm gon na end your <unk> <unk> 
 something else i ca n't think of 
 anyways hope you enjoyed this bit of a long post 
 <unk> in next time for : the horrible upstairs neighbors and the dog <unk> filled pillow 
 j out 
 2 months later edit 
 : i was just informed that he cheated on her repeatedly is now single and heartbroken 
 i actually spent the time to call her and have a chat 
 first thing she said 
 now i know how you felt ... i 'm sorry j ... '' which honestly sucks 
 on one hand i feel vindicated even more on the other i would n't wish it upon anyone 
 even her 
 but this pretty much officially closes the story 
 what goes around comes around and maybe 
 just <unk> we can be friends 
 it 's been long enough and i absolutely do **not** want to get back together 
 that would be another nightmare all over again 
 time will tell 
 peace out guys 
 will get to the horrible upstairs neighbors and the dog <unk> filled pillow soon <unk> years back when myspace was still on top my family came down to visit and stay at my mother 's place for a few days 
 among them was my stoner racist idiot is idiot redundant 
 cousin 
 i had stopped by and at some point i got on her pc on my account and started doing some <unk> on a website i was building for a local restaurant 
 something came up and i had to step out of the house for a bit 
 i did not set this computer up with passwords for the user accounts still dumb but i 've since learned as the only two people who have physical access to the computer were my mother and i. so just leaving my stuff logged in was never an issue but i had failed to take into account the stoner racist idiot cousin 
 while i 'm away he decides for possibly the first time in his life that he would like to read something 
 unfortunately he decided that it would take the form of snooping through my email chat logs and internet history again it was my mom 's pc so his search for whatever crazy porn i might have been into was <unk> 
 naturally when i get back he brags about how much of a <unk> <unk> he is by telling me about his recent exploits through my personal email logs etc ... if he would have kept his mouth shut i might not have known 
 so as soon as possible i went through and changed all my passwords 
 i could n't take the chance that this little <unk> had access to websites i had built for myself and others among other things 
 in a way he really did do me a favor by showing me that i needed to be more paranoid about leaving accounts logged in and password security 
 ahhh yes the revenge part password security 
 my cousin had logged into his aim account while this was going on it was set up to save login info 
 this particular version of aim was pretty bad at storing passwords securely 
 so after about 30 seconds worth of effort i had his password which he used on every single account he had 
 i use this to see what he 's up to on myspace 
 his profile is filled with pics and videos of girls in bikini 's alcohol and pictures of hitler 
 that just is n't proper so i changed it 
 hitler becomes <unk> <unk> king jr. girls making out turn into men slipknot videos turn into bob ross <unk> videos 
 the cherry on top was his slipknot <unk> being turned into a my little pony '' <unk> 
 at this time there was no such thing as a <unk> 
 i was thinking about changing it back minus the <unk> crap after he apologized so i made backups 
 to be quite honest i was probably just telling myself that to <unk> my own guilt over changing his settings 
 but then ... hitler ... naturally when he goes to log in he sees the changes and flips out 
 he jumped to conclusions and <unk> thought other kids in his high school were behind the <unk> 
 he started a <unk> during school which ended up being the last straw for his school 's administration he has a history and got himself expelled for the rest of the year 
 at this point i was still ready to change stuff back and keep in mind i had n't changed his passwords when he figured out it was me and sent me this message ... umm ya i dont know why the fuck you did but i want you to unlock all my accounts u hacked and put the back to the way they were before u fuckin touched them '' so ... no i do n't like threats at all 
 at this point his password seemed like it was <unk> to just two people ... like it needed to be freed see the world and all 
 so somehow it got posted to a forum my friends and i visited 
 it quickly when to nsfw town and within a few days his accounts were banned 
 afterwards he told me he was most upset about losing his rare '' slipknot <unk> 
 found one <unk> lost the nsfw ones 
 <unk> **tldr : <unk> neo-nazi gets his myspace <unk> starts fights in high school gets expelled 
 ** as above x-post /r/pettyrevenge as it was suggested it belongs here : - following a line of traffic in town about 20 mph and the lane to the left of me was a left turn filter 
 the motorbike who had <unk> up behind me at a fair speed decided he wanted to <unk> me and went down the left turn lane and then popped out in front of me far too close and yes im a biker so i do know 
 i flashed my lights at him once and he freaked out at me turning in the <unk> to give me the finger 
 now fair enough do it once -- but he carried on doing it shouting from inside his helmet <unk> 
 and shaking his fist at me and this is important <unk> paying attention to the road in front 
 i saw my opportunity : i opened my eyes dropped my jaw <unk> the wheel and slammed on my brakes 
 then came the best moment of my life as i saw the <unk> realization in his eyes as he imagined what i was braking for <unk> must be in front of him 
 my words can not do justice to his frantic attempt to turn his body <unk> at the <unk> brake hard and steer all at the same moment whilst is brain was engaged at trying to figure out the emergency 
 just as well i was already braking as the subsequent swerve <unk> flip and bounce on the floor in front of everyone was a joy to my heart 
 honest -- i did try not to be giggling when i drove past him struggling to pick up his bike when i was 25 i moved into a house out in portland <unk> barely knowing anyone in the city 
 i needed a roommate so i <unk> an ad and conducted a small set of interviews to fill the extra room 
 a guy named travis moved into the room eventually 
 he was younger than me by about 4 years but he had a consistent job and seemed reasonable so i took him 
 moving in three weeks later i find out he lied about everything in the interview 
 he had no job 
 his dad paid his rent 
 he had a click of <unk> douche bags that would hang out at the house all day 
 i had invited in a self proclaimed <unk> '' into the house 
 face to face he would be nice to me in his sly way 
 when i left the house he would subtly search through my room and steal petty shit - a used fax machine quarters out of my change jar outdated mp3 player old watches he found to be <unk> '' etc 
 i confronted him a few times and he would always deny it 
 when i caught him openly eating my food and denying it i attempted to kick him out 
 he stayed by citing his tenant 's rights 
 because most of it was petty i decided to look the other way while his ego grew bigger 
 things died down for a few weeks 
 one day i come back home from work and travis had stolen the only shirt i knew he would steal from my closet 
 it was a two year old <unk> shirt 
 when he had the nerve to wear it in front of me i decided this was the final straw 
 giving him his last way out i decided to ask him : hey i have that same exact shirt in my closet '' 
 i figured if he had any soul left he would simply say i borrowed it from your closet '' 
 he decided to lie about it telling me he had gotten it from the mall a few days ago 
 the audacity 
 the sociopath switch in my head decided to flip on 
 i knew travis thought i was too pussy to ask for the shirt back 
 he thought i was a <unk> and i was going to play directly into that 
 i understood the <unk> of a young 20 something alpha male '' 
 travis birthday was coming up in about a month and a half he made it known because he told me his mom was going to get him a new <unk> shirt and i was going to make that the day i strike 
 i played into his fake <unk> and started hanging out with him 
 i made friends with his douche bag friends 
 when they started calling me i knew i had them 
 i 'd buy them occasional drinks when we were out to seed my future plans of <unk> 
 birthday comes 
 game time 
 travis had an obsession with doing cocaine over the last few months 
 nothing big since he was broke so most of his binge 's were in small amounts 
 i pulled him over in the middle of the day and told him i had a birthday surprise for him 
 to pump up his ego more i told him i only did this for the best of my boys '' 
 we go out for a night of drinks 
 i buy him enough drinks to get him shit housed and we head back to the house for the after party 
 i had called a few females over during the night to make the after party request legit 
 when we get to the house i walk out of my room with half an eight of cocaine in my hands 
 travis 
 this is the surprise you 've been waiting for '' 
 i dump a mound of white onto a black plate and spelled his name out on it 
 i was going to take a picture of travis hitting the fattest line of cocaine in <unk> with his name one it 
 with his name laid out in cocaine over a black plate the stage was set 
 i hand travis a rolled up twenty and told him to hit it 
 the pandemonium behind his back built the pressure <unk> need to push him into doing it 
 as travis sucked his head down to the plate i told him to give me a party pose next to his special surprise 
 travis produced the single best duck face pose i had ever seen 
 one hand holding the rolled up twenty and the other to throw his white boy <unk> <unk> 
 gotcha 
 the next morning everyone was <unk> 
 the girls had left about an hour after we reached the house and the chemical leftovers of the alcohol and cocaine destroyed any <unk> planned within the house 
 i call up my friend nick to induce the second part of the plan 
 nick was labeled as my russian body guard 
 he was 6'5 and <unk> in at about <unk> pounds of pure muscle 
 when nick arrives me and him go into travis room and drag him by his legs into the living room 
 travis was startled but barely awake 
 i bring him a laptop with the picture i had taken last night of him 
 you are looking at a picture i took of you last night 
 i 've already uploaded it into a image hosting site and copied this picture into a couple of safe places 
 there is no erasing this picture 
 understand '' 
 yes '' you 're job right now is to prevent this from getting sent to your parents 
 the only way prevent this from getting sent to your parents is to pay for the coke i bought you last night and move the fuck out '' 
 because travis did not have a car i gave him rides to his parents work and place of residence 
 i also knew a few of the addresses of where his friend 's parents lived google 
 travis was scared <unk> of his dad 
 if i had threatened to send any details of his fast life to his dad travis would obey everything 
 in the end i had travis pay $ 400 dollars for the half eight i had only paid $ 50 for 
 travis moved out of the house within the same day 
 about 3 months after the situation i moved out of the house we shared 
 i sent the picture to his parents 
 to his parent 's bosses 
 to all his parent 's neighbors 
 then to all the friend 's parent 's addresses 
 the cost 
 about $ 250 dollars 
 all paid for <unk> travis 
 **i do have proof 
 picture is around on one of my computers and i 'll post that in the update if people are interested 
 ** tl dr talked my <unk> thief of a roommate into buying a sack coke and having me take a picture of him doing a line of cocaine with his name <unk> out on it 
 which then i used the picture to blackmail him with 
 then using the money i <unk> from him i sent the picture to everyone his parents knew 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> has been officially uploaded at suck it <unk> 
 **i got super bored at work and decided to just make it 
 so here it is /r/regularrevenge i made it literally about ten minutes ago so if people actually want it i 'll go ahead and make it a little more serious in terms of rules and what 's allowed or not allowed as well as bring mods from the main revenge subs if they so like 
 for now let 's just see if it 's even well received by the communities 
 edit : i have added <unk> in the /r/regularrevenge sub in order to comply with <unk> 's idea 
 i hope this is a welcome choice and please feel free to share any ideas you have about changing or helping the subreddit in the <unk> post over <unk> is an <unk> so the details may be a little vague but only just found this sub 
 many years ago i entered into my first mobile phone cell contract with a large <unk> company here in the <unk> 
 i signed for a 24 month term and also signed for an odd on to the contract that gave me extra data at a small additional charge 
 this add on was not contracted i simply had to give notice of cancellation a few days prior to the payment date and the payment would not be taken and the add on would <unk> at the end of the billing period 
 after a couple of months i provided the notice of cancellation and received confirmation that i would no longer be charged 
 i think no more of it and live my life happily 
 at the end of the contract i log into my account management website to confirm that i wish to cancel and do n't want to <unk> onto a new plan 
 here i notice that i am still being charged for the add on that i cancelled 
 i look through my history and notice that 17 months of payments had been taken after the cancellation 
 thats almost £170 that i had n't wished to pay 
 the next day i phone their customer service department who informs me that they can see that it was due for cancellation but could not explain why the cancellation was never <unk> 
 they were very apologetic but explained that i should log a complaint via email and it would be looked into 
 i do just that and after a lot of chasing around and being sold excuses such as outstanding system issues that prevented the cancellation and were still <unk> '' to not following the correct cancellation procedure so the add on was not cancelled '' 
 after a lot of back and forth i grow tired of explanations and just cut to the chase : can i get a refund of the <unk> charges that i was not expecting to pay and was informed would be cancelled 
 please issue to this account <unk> acc info <unk> 
 i attached the previous mail that i had received at the time of cancellation as evidence 
 they still refused to issue a refund and instead offered me 1 month of free add on 
 not acceptable 
 i did some digging and found their customer services director 's email address and cc 's him into my response which read the same as the above email 
 i received the following reply : hi <unk> 
 thanks for contacting us and apologies for the confusion caused 
 we will immediately issue a credit to your account for the amount of £170 as a good will gesture 
 regards xyz '' 
 the reply did no longer have the director listed as a cc so i guess i scared the normal adviser into action 
 however by this point 6 weeks or so had passed since i initially logged my complaint so i was a little pissed 
 i responded with : thanks xyz i appreciate the good will gesture 
 however as i have been incorrectly charged for a service i did not wish for and a service i had understood to be cancelled i believe i am entitled to a fill refund of the services paid 
 as such please refund the full <unk> to the same account '' 
 i received a very short reply : i have issued a refund notice which should be processed in 14 working days 
 thanks '' 
 felt bad for the guy who simply forgot to use the correct wording when issuing me with the initial payment but by this time i was frustrated and just wanted the money 
 i enjoyed the extra 170 they gave me 
 tldr : company failed to stop charges to my account i received a good will gesture '' in place of a refund pushed for a refund as well as the good will gesture and earned £170 for my efforts 
 background : i am a sysadmin for a web <unk> company 
 for those who did n't know yesterday was <unk> appreciation day where coworkers are encouraged to give appreciation to their <unk> 
 one of my coworkers let 's call him matt is smart slighty arrogant <unk> and a bit of a dick 
 he <unk> to <unk> and annoy people as a joke and he 'll happily let it go into harassment if he can get away with it 
 on the <unk> if you do anything to him hoo boy he does n't take it well 
 tl dr : he can dish it but he ca n't take it 
 anyway so yesterday he was looking forward to some appreciation from the rest of the company as he believed he deserved it and he let us all know this 
 which he does to a degree because he has been doing a lot of the shit work - we 've been secretly assigning those tickets to him : p over the course of the day we did get a lot of thanks from our colleagues but one of the project teams came down with beer and cake had to hide the project name due to the <unk> in thanks for all the work we 've done for them 
 well by <unk> they actually meant me and they said as much as i had been the sole sysadmin working on the <unk> project 
 the rest of the team had no issue with this because they knew how much hell i 'd gone through working on it but matt did n't like this one fucking bit 
 the only present we get and he could n't have any of it 
 insufferable 
 so he became very vocal about this and insisted that the cake was actually for all of us not that he cared about the others 
 i was planning on sharing anyway but looking at how he was acting i saw my chance to piss him off 
 revenge for all the false rumours he spread to make my life difficult revenge for all the times he 'd randomly <unk> with my <unk> shell settings right before project deadlines revenge for all the other things he 'd done to piss me off for his shits and giggles 
 i insisted that the cake was only for me and that he should fuck off 
 he started calling me a 'greedy cunt and a <unk> bastard and a bunch of other things 
 he insisted on some cake because he had done some work on the project as well 
 he had actually but it was so minor no one remembered or cared 
 except for him right now because he wanted some cake 
 so i laughed and said sure okay here 's your piece '' and threw some icing at him 
 he got even more angry at me and i explained that it was <unk> to his contribution to the project 
 he got so angry he tried insulting me more but it came out in a <unk> and he stormed off mumbling something about getting lunch 
 when he left the rest of us burst into laughter at how childish he was acting 
 we decided to prank him even more so we took photos of us eating all the cake and only left one plate on my desk to make it look like i had eaten all of it while he was away 
 i also knew that he 'd start to play the victim and try get others on his side 
 so i sent out an email to the company explaining the prank and asking that they play along and ignore any <unk> from him 
 turns out it was a good move as he 'd already started texting several people about me being a 'greedy bastard and that this is why you should n't give <unk> anything '' so when he came back he was still <unk> and <unk> and stayed like this for the rest of the day 
 it was n't helped by other victims of his deciding to get some revenge and coming down with <unk> chocolate etc just for me : p this was completely unintended and a masterful stroke on their part because he stayed so upset that he stormed out of the office the minute it hit <unk> he did n't even take any of the free beer and he 's normally all over free alcohol 
 jesus how we laughed when he had left 
 who knew that the <unk> matt would get so upset over something like cake 
 i sure as hell did n't and i hope he enjoys the photos of us eating the cake that are in his inbox : **edit : ** and how did the cake taste 
 delicious : d **edit 2 : ** so yesterday he came in an saw the pictures and seemed to take it pretty well 
 he laughed at them and admitted that we got him good 
 i think he realised that he was being a stupid twat about the whole thing i mean it 's only cake for crying out loud 
 however i 'm still keeping my guard up as this may be a ruse to be honest : / & gt when george lucas tried to <unk> his production company <unk> in <unk> wealthy <unk> county the community pushed back 
 then the <unk> <unk> <unk> wanted to sell the land to a developer who would build affordable housing 
 & gt <unk> <unk> class <unk> ” <unk> <unk> then head of the north san <unk> coalition of residents told the new york times at the time 
 & gt now two years after that project <unk> lucas has decided to build the affordable housing and pay for it all himself 
 & gt <unk> got enough millionaires here 
 what we need is some houses for regular working people ” lucas said through his lawyer gary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reported 
 **tl dr : ** <unk> neighbors did n't let lucas build a studio 
 he gets them some <unk> neighbors and kills their property <unk> come from a family of professional <unk> 
 getting revenge be it petty or plotting an ocean 's 11 style caper is in my blood 
 this happened back in the 80 's with my aunt j and mom pulling <unk> on each other 
 my mom had just pulled a massively evil prank on j by <unk> a fake rubber snake to the lid of one of those <unk> basket <unk> on a visit to her place 
 j is <unk> afraid of snakes and this caused her a near heartattack from <unk> 
 to get her revenge j recruited the aid of some neighborhood friends and waited for when my mom left for the afternoon shopping 
 she uses her key to open our house and move all of the furniture couches tables chairs tv and tv stands book shelves coffee tables 
 literally everything that touched the floors onto the several trucks waiting outside 
 two or so hours later my mom comes home with my little sister and i in tow and opens the door 
 she just stands there to a completely empty living room family room and <unk> 
 she <unk> 
 * m : omg we 've been robbed '' 
 j had even recruited our cop neighbor officer s to be waiting outside washing his car 
 back in the 80 's you did n't just immediately dial 911 as this was n't a life threatening emergency 
 my mom goes over to officer s and explains the story 
 he will help her but they would have to go down to the station for a lengthy report ... best drop the kids off some place this is part of the plan 
 my mom knows that j is home with her kids summer time so she piles us in the car to drive to the next neighborhood over 
 as there are lots of rolling hills where we live my mom turns the bend to j 's street to see an unusually large <unk> of cars parks outside of her house 
 in fact it looks like a large gathering out in front complete with chairs tables couches desks ... as my mom pulls up still not registering what was going on being that she just got robbed and all it hits her <unk> that couch looks like my couch that table is almost exactly like mine ... * '' 
 15 neighbors are all <unk> looking at the yard sale '' my aunt j was having with my mom 's furniture 
 j has the biggest grin on her face and mouths gotcha 
 a couple of years ago i was driving my brand spanking new <unk> mound of steel <unk> and dead <unk> along a local road when i got <unk> by adam asshat a juvenile <unk> <unk> in a pos car 
 you may know the kinds of person and car i 'm talking about : the wheels are a <unk> <unk> version of a <unk> poorly maintained and <unk> by previous owners who ended up tuning '' the poor machine with various pieces of <unk> and refuse <unk> to it to give anyone who looks at it the idea it is a proper monster - albeit that the illusion does n't last any longer than two seconds except for the <unk> impaired of course 
 as a rule such cars are <unk> with members of a <unk> group of wasted <unk> wearing <unk> caps and usually fake <unk> <unk> <unk> while they 're cruising around with a cell-phone glued to their ear an offense that will soon be <unk> by death or so i hear and hollering insults at anybody who fails to <unk> to the <unk> <unk> '' <unk> from the <unk> that they use as a <unk> exhaust '' 
 well one of these <unk> driving a <unk> takes over across a white line and proceeds to jam his car between me and the person in front of me 
 i <unk> subject my new car 's <unk> to an impromptu <unk> and proceed to flip my shit as per standard <unk> procedure 
 <unk> bastard does n't even seem to notice ... come the next red light yours truly and charlie <unk> end up next to each other 
 i roll down my powered window and advise the little cunt to refrain from such actions for the foreseeable future 
 <unk> dipshit proceeds to laugh and roll his windows back up 
 the lights turn green and off he goes gunning that <unk> of his for all he 's worth which in my humble opinion would be less than his <unk> would fetch me on the black market but i digress 
 from here on we 're at a <unk> road 
 i drive here daily and know this road like the back of my hand 
 i know that we 're in a <unk> green wave '' area meaning that the lights are timed for 50 kmph 
 i also know that there 's another traffic light some 200 yards further down the road 
 this together with some other knowledge of this stretch of asphalt makes that a plan begins to take shape in my head 
 rear view mirror : no cops 
 sides : no cops 
 i ram down on the accelerator and within seconds i 'm back next to him - grinning like a madman 
 we stand at a red light <unk> at one another 
 <unk> excrement <unk> his seat sits up and revs his engine 
 i set the <unk> control on my <unk> <unk> piece of japanese <unk> to sport '' 
 he <unk> his <unk> and tells his mate to <unk> 
 a faint smile plays on my lips as i <unk> with the buttons on my steering column revving the engine to answer his challenge 
 he <unk> out his cigarette and after <unk> at me one more time <unk> on the traffic light 
 i do the same thing keeping the <unk> liter <unk> engine under my estate 's <unk> at 1750 rpm my gear in first and the clutch down 
 the tension is mounting - it 's a <unk> at the ok <unk> 
 i hear an eagle shriek while <unk> blow across the street and dramatic music by <unk> <unk> plays 
 the light turns green ... i <unk> the throttle and gone are all <unk> of <unk> at high noon - i am now <unk> the <unk> ready to take out this <unk> 
 the clutch comes up the engine <unk> its <unk> <unk> 's of power and its <unk> <unk> of <unk> not so much pulling me along earth as it seems to push the earth itself away from underneath it 
 i ram down the clutch second gear 
 my car sounds like a <unk> <unk> about to <unk> on its quarry while <unk> fuckwit 's pos subaru does - i hate to admit - keep up quite good 
 the difference is <unk> at best ... we 're doing 60 - 70 - 80 kmph in a matter of seconds 
 i am taking a small lead now i can win this 
 and then my cars <unk> out on me ... my car wo n't go any faster 
 the sound has changed the raging <unk> has <unk> <unk> kitten <unk> in satisfaction 
 my head snaps right and i see <unk> in gary <unk> 's eyes as he peels away from me <unk> to as he goes 
 i swear he must 've been doing at least 140 kmph when i saw the <unk> double flash reflected in his rear window 
 i let the car roll out passing the speed camera that had been placed there less than a week before at a <unk> and legal 50 kmph 
 pulling up next to him at the next traffic light - no longer in the green zone <unk> i rolled down the window again and leaned out explaining how modern cars had all sorts of nifty gadgets for instance the possibility of setting a do not <unk> '' <unk> through the <unk> throttle 
 fyi : <unk> the speed limits by 110 kmph in a <unk> area <unk> a fine of around 500 euros 
 tl : dr - <unk> cut me off i got him to race me on a road when i knew a speed camera was <unk> 's just start this out with “i was a stupid teenager when this happened 
 if i knew now the potential damages i could have done then i would n't have done anything ... <unk> i might have done something less <unk> 
 also 
 this is a silly wall of text 
 alright i was working at an overnight camp as a teen 
 the kids there stayed overnight for one month at a time 
 there were 2 <unk> and 8 children in each cabin 
 i was a counselor for a group of 4th graders 
 overall they were fairly amazing kids i got to wake up at 8am and then spend the next 14 hours running about like a crazy person with a posse made of very short people 
 it kicked all sorts of ass 
 the problem always happened at meals 
 at the camp in addition to 30 <unk> of fairly awesome children there was a group of maintenance workers 
 all but one of them were <unk> dudes but the last one was less than ideal 
 my cabin ate at the same table every meal they were assigned tables and one table away there was the maintenance crew 
 at the maintenance table there were like 30 ridiculous hot sauces 
 like “blah blah blah if you put this in your eyes you 'll go <unk> level hot sauce 
 painful monstrous <unk> 
 now every time i left the table to go to the bathroom or take a kid outside when he 's having a meltdown or any sort of <unk> thing i 'd return to the table and something of mine would likely be coated with hot sauce and i 'd discover it after <unk> the hot sauce 
 basically a month of humiliating <unk> shit that was <unk> my ability to lead this pile of 4th graders combined with a month of me saying <unk> mr. a do n't do this bullshit not only is it bullshit but it also makes the counseling less <unk> 
 this turned into a large pile of him goddamn not listening to me or his boss the head of the maintenance crew was a goddamn amazing <unk> <unk> human being that kept the entire camp running due to being a legitimate badass that was just living at a camp he loved for <unk> 
 at the end of the month i was sick to my back teeth of <unk> 's ridiculous bullshit 
 i had just stood up to get a cup of coffee came back to my spoon coated in <unk> ridiculous pile of spicy <unk> 
 i calmly <unk> ... as calmly as i could with a mouth full of burning pain went up to him and his boss and stated that this was ridiculous 
 i 'd eat whatever the fuck <unk> he wanted if he 'd then match me <unk> in mildly caffeinated mints 
 he agreed to this challenge infront of his boss the badass <unk> really cool guy that 'd been my friend for the past few years 
 at this time i was enjoying a caffeine tolerance of the sort that you only get from 2 years of 72 hour <unk> <unk> that i used to get through all of school 
 gallons of coffee each day 
 <unk> pots of coffee each day 
 at my car i had a <unk> pile of loot from think geek 
 <unk> $ of <unk> mints that i was using to keep up with a pile of 4th graders 
 so ... ... .i then at 3 gigantic <unk> of ridiculous hot sauce then politely excused myself and walked to my car with my mouth full of fire sorta seething with goddamn rage 
 i go grab eight packs of caffeinated mints <unk> mints 
 <unk> per packet and return back to the dining hall 
 i then place four packets of mints infront of mr. a and just start <unk> down the other 4 packets 
 mr. a eats 1 single mint and looks like he 's going to puke 
 the awesome sergeant boss of his just takes one look at him and starts laughing stating that <unk> of you did shake on <unk> 
 with a defeated look mr. a goes back to the mints 
 so mr. a takes like ... 20 minutes to finish the mints and we both enjoy <unk> goddamn grams of <unk> 
 i due to my hideous caffeine habits at that time am able to shake off the mints in a night 
 he has heart <unk> has to go get his stomach pumped and is hung over as fuck for the next 3 days 
 at that point i never had a day with hot sauce on my food 
 i saw him again like ... ten months later i felt bad about poisoning him but we laughed about it due to both of us eating the pile of delicious mints 
 tl : dr ... .i sorta poisoned an acquaintance and then we were cool after that edit : at that time i did n't really realize how insanely dangerous <unk> grams of caffeine could be to someone without a tolerance 
 i 've always been what most would call a fat '' kid 
 and as such i have been tormented and bullied for most of my life 
 anyways a few days ago i got back at a kid who was one of the main people bullying me 
 my friend owned a vape '' or <unk> and brought it to school with him regularly and a week ago he dropped it and it fell through the bottom of his locker and into the <unk> below him he has gym on the opposite days as us and my friend asks him about it <unk> kid says he 'll give it back but a week later we find out he sold it to someone else 
 so naturally we accidentally '' poured a whole carton of milk into his locker 
 and now it will sit there 
 all through our week and a half long break but did i go too far 
 tl dr kid stole my friends vape i poured chocolate milk into his locker to ferment over break 
 edit : we made it to the front page this story takes place a couple years ago but it 's probably my most satisfying story of revenge 
 many years ago i was big into world of warcraft 
 i specifically liked something called model editing which is a term for a type of hacking where you change client-side files to <unk> the client-side experience only mostly <unk> stuff but some things which affect the server side that i never messed with because i did n't want to get banned 
 i was a member on some forums for this type of thing where people shared their projects with the community 
 i saw it as a form of art pretty much 
 a couple years ago <unk> i had n't played world of warcraft for some time and my account was <unk> but i decided to go back and check some old threads i posted and <unk> old comments on the model editing forums for <unk> purposes only 
 instead of <unk> through the website to find my old posts i just did a google search to find it 
 the top hit was a thread on some forum i 'd never heard of but with my exact same title text and pictures 
 i of course decided to do some snooping and found that this person had <unk> just about every single thread i had posted without giving me credit at all as if he had created them himself 
 <unk> they were all fairly new posts too 
 i was pretty annoyed but figured that there was n't really anything i could do 
 the <unk> link he posted had long since been taken down by the hosting website and even if it still worked the model edit would n't have been compatible with the many years newer version of wow and yet he was still getting positive comments and <unk> 
 the only option i could see was to post a few annoyed comments on some of his posts about how he was stealing my work 
 after getting no response i decided that i would go to my <unk> account and remove the old pictures so essentially his threads would be saying look at this model edit i did '' 
 followed by zero pictures and a <unk> link that does n't work 
 however when i got there i found a much more satisfying option 
 apparently <unk> allows you to edit your pictures and then replace the original file with the newly edited one 
 armed with this new resource i <unk> some text on one of the pictures in his <unk> thread giving credit to myself and posting a link to the original thread and forum 
 within hours there were negative comments showing up on all of his threads about how he 's a <unk> 
 he quickly took down my edited picture and posted a short credit to me at the bottom of his post but the damage was done 
 people started posting original links in other threads that he 'd stolen 
 from what i can tell he eventually became a bit of a <unk> 
 here 's the original thread : here 's one i made a couple minutes ago for verification : a long time ago in a state far far away a college town in a <unk> state in the early 80 's our little pizza shop had a big problem with a couple of frat houses 
 actually a lot of the pizza and delivery places had problems with the frat houses that was in all <unk> a big problem with a few bad apples -- but there were a couple of houses that seemed to have an even higher ah <unk> 
 the issue for us was related to our 30 minutes or free policy long since <unk> and the thought that with some <unk> and lying you might be able to get a pizza without handing over any cash 
 since we were anal about times -- and did in fact give away pizza when it was late the occasional <unk> that tried to get a free pizza without having it be late got exactly what was coming to them -- usually a visit from the cops if they got too out of hand a stern <unk> from a manager was usually enough though 
 but one house in particular seemed to have quite a few bad orders 
 sometimes i would come into work and there would be a note by the phones for this particular house let 's just call it aσς 
 the note would say something like we are no longer taking orders from anyone in the aσς frat '' 
 on really rare occasion : tonight we 're not taking orders from any frat '' 
 yeah they were that problematic -- note i have nothing to compare this to maybe some other pizza people want to share i 'm curious if this is still going on or was commonplace 
 one night in particular one of our drivers comes back from aσς not just with the <unk> pizza but with piss all over him 
 seems he got to the house on time and rather than go through the usual i 'm a real dick and want to challenge your time even though it 's been like 10 minutes '' they simply refused to open the door 
 it was a two story house and this guy was persistent when he went to a side door they opened a window above him and dumped it on him 
 making things worse this driver was a hard working <unk> kind of guy -- everyone in the shop loved working with him 
 he had a great attitude and was the kind of person who 'd be there for you if you needed him 
 dumping piss on him was the last straw 
 so the manager calls the cops and they drive over to the ole aσς frat house and the stage is set 
 the door is answered by a lone aσς member who comes across as just your honest hardworking college guy who 's really sorry for the confusion 
 the cop <unk> if he 's aware that someone dumped piss on the driver -- and this guy conveys that yes he 's aware and they 're all really sorry they did n't mean to do it it was a college prank gone bad 
 awe shucks '' kind of manner 
 cop : which person here did it '' 
 awe shucks <unk> <unk> around and finally confesses that in fact it was he the poor hardworking college guy that did it and he 's really really sorry 
 so my manager looks at the cop and more or less conveys that it 's time to throw the book at awe shucks 
 they slap the cuffs on him and to his <unk> <unk> he 's tucked into a squad car and everyone heads down to the local police station for a booking that will involve a weekend in jail or someone bailing this guy out -- it 's not going to be something a simple apology <unk> in other words 
 they 're taking this guys confession when a <unk> of aσς frat guys arrives at the station asking to see the cop that 's doing the <unk> paperwork 
 my manager is still there with the driver and this is where the revenge portion really kicks in 
 this was n't even planned and i can only imagine that the cops were really sick of the aσς frat bs because what happens next would have been awesome to catch on cell phone video believe it or not there was a time when such things were not commonplace 
 two of the arriving aσς party are having a rare moment of guilty conscience and proceed to confess to the officer that it 's not awe shucks who dumped the piss but in fact it was them 
 the cop proceeds to take their confession down <unk> on all ends that yes in fact it was these two clowns and not awe shucks who dumped the piss 
 everyone is in agreement 
 so they book the two guys and put them in jail for the night by this time it 's well past midnight 
 then awe shucks after <unk> about how he wishes it would n't have come to this why would n't we all just accept an apology for this 
 it was just a harmless prank 
 goes to leave 
 where are you going '' 
 says the cop 
 i 'm free to go are n't i '' 
 says awe shucks 
 cop proceeds to book awe shucks for some kind of false witness charge and he joins his two buddies for the night 
 later that night a bunch of <unk> vandalism happens to the aσς house -- sometime in the wee hours of the morning -- say after some late night pizza people are done cleaning their store 
 from what i remember it involved some kind of construction bridge paint being applied to the bricks and windows of their house -- it 's been a while and i wish i could have seen the application -- i just remember seeing the house for weeks messed up with big block letters and paint on the windows 
 and it does n't really end there -- the university ended up <unk> the <unk> 's right to have a house on campus 
 this happened awhile ago 
 it was back when i was in high school 
 there was this guy that would hang out with my group of friends but it seemed like no one really liked this guy 
 even though no on really wanted him around he would always somehow figure out where we were at 
 anyhow this guys was constantly an asshole to me making <unk> comments and <unk> at me all the time 
 it was around the time that every one of my friends was getting their driving license and just starting to drive 
 at this time there was some friendly window <unk> of each other 's cars 
 nothing <unk> just if you saw a buddies car you would write something on their windshield like : got you bitch 
 something like that 
 fast forward a couple of months and that asshole gets my car 
 he does n't use window <unk> though 
 he pours syrup on my car and <unk> candles on my <unk> 
 it was a cold night so the syrup froze on my car and the only way to get the candle wax off of windows is with a razor 
 i find out that it was the asshole that did this to me and i swear revenge 
 my car back then was a <unk> that i did n't really care about but the assholes car was a 2 year old jeep 
 so the next weekend one of my buddies is having everyone over to his house to play poker 
 now poker is the assholes favorite game to play so i know he will be there 
 when my buddy calls to invite me over i decline <unk> <unk> 
 i plan on getting my revenge that night 
 since the asshole has an idea that i will try and get revenge he gets my buddy to let him pull his jeep inside his garage 
 so when i get there i check all the doors to the garage they 're locked 
 i then do a little <unk> and find that everyone is in the basement playing poker 
 then i sneak in the front door and creep into the garage with my bag of goodies 
 there is the jeep 
 i proceed to dump : cheese sauce <unk> syrup chocolate syrup cooking oil bird seed and planting <unk> 
 i also fully covered every one of his windows in green candle wax 
 i then <unk> away and went home 
 the best part was apparently <unk> stayed the night at my buddies so the asshole did n't get to his car for around 10-12 hours 
 apparently the combination of all that stuff messed up his paint job a little bit and he had to get it redone 
 he also suspected it was me but could n't ever prove it 
 he threatened me with law suits but never filed one 
 i know this is n't as good as most of the ones i 've seen on here but i felt like badass when i did <unk> took a job as it assistant for a local firm and the boss it manager we shall call him pa for passive aggressive or positively arrogant if you prefer 
 pa had been with the company for about 17 years 
 during this time he wrote a custom web solution involving thousands of files as well as a hardware solution that was almost completely lacking in documentation let alone <unk> documentation 
 i should have suspected something was up when he took me into a server room with a sea of ethernet cables labeled only on one end leading into various holes in the wall 
 when i asked what was the meaning of the cryptic numbers on the cables <unk> a4 for example and was referred to <unk> map with only eight numbers and nothing else i knew i was in trouble 
 at least he made an attempt to write some <unk> about how to do this or that but they were so vague all they would do was serve for his reminders but would not work for anyone else 
 before me he had hired a <unk> of assistants only to have them let go for no <unk> nor reason '' according to a co-worker 
 he would belittle me for taking so long to do tasks telling me i should take calculated risks '' about what i was supposed to do but programmers are taught to be thorough and to not take risks with company data by doing things you are not sure of 
 he would be rude and insulting when had no time to guide me or help me understand his custom system 
 i have to admit his code was great but his attitude was guaranteed to put anyone off from wanting to ask him anything 
 towards the end of the job there i was so stressed out it was literally killing me 
 people would remark that i looked white as a sheet and ready to drop 
 i could not sleep at night and i had to crawl to the bathroom because i would black out trying to walk at night 
 well after a year he decided he was going to take a vacation and leave everything to me for a month 
 he also <unk> on me an unannounced project of <unk> data to be done in two and a half hours on the first monday after he left 
 the data import alone took about four hours so how in the hell he thought i could do this huge data import in the time expected was beyond me 
 the day i was let go he told me that i was not a good fit for the company and they let me go with severance pay which was nice but during the interview he cited three projects i did not get done in time and after i left i realized that one of them was a project he told me to stop working on and another was a project to upgrade some software they had spent money on but i discovered bugs in the software and was told to not install it till the bugs were fixed 
 it took the <unk> of the software six weeks to fix the bugs and i got <unk> from them and the president of the company i worked at for being very helpful in tracking down the bugs 
 after i got home i realized pa let me go blaming me for late projects he told me to delay on 
 i also began to remember all the insulting things he said and i began to figure it out 
 this delay in figuring out what happened is a feature of ptsd 
 i was friends with the owner of the company and i wrote him an email about the issues 
 i told him how he keeps hiring people to do it assistant yet required them to already know the custom system he built over a period of 17 years 
 i mentioned how he refused to help new hires <unk> themselves with the code - heck it was only after 10 months that i was given access to the code to even look at 
 i asked him if he did n't find it suspicious that he would hire someone go on a large vacation then come back and fire them 
 i said how many assistant it persons has companyname gone through and how many more will companyname go through before they realize that the person they are looking for does not exist and start to insist that pa teach the new hire the <unk> 
 it was right after this that pa was told that no new hires would be accepted and that new <unk> would have to be done out of house - aka hire contract programmers 
 none in the area wanted to touch the project so they ended up hiring a team from india 
 pa possibly because he lacked interpersonal skills got so frustrated having to explain what code he wanted was supposed to do finally quit with the statement i 'm tired of all the bs '' 
 he now works as a programmer elsewhere but thankfully he is not <unk> anyone else 
 ps : in case the revenge was missed ... he ended up with a job that had less prestige less pay no <unk> to abuse like he did others 
 it was a job that they frequently offered to college students for $ <unk> an hour 
 i do n't know what he got before but i know it was good enough for him to take a month vacation in <unk> 
 it caused him difficulty it made me feel somewhat better and somewhat vindicated and a hell of a lot better to know he would not be able to <unk> another person 
 tldr : manager refuses to manage and train ends up frustrated into quitting after i point out his lack of performance to the owner after i was let <unk> was in a relationship with this guy for 2 years we were happy i had introduced him to all my family including my son 
 then i found out that i was one of 2 women he was in a relationship with 
 i found this out by the first woman contacting me and then the whole story came to light 
 well once i found this out i decided i needed my revenge 
 i knew that this guy was driving without insurance or tax on his car so i decided to make an anonymous tip off to crime <unk> british service to <unk> in people who commit crime 
 i did n't think much of it until i got a call from the other woman who asked me if i knew why his car was clamped outside her house 
 i said i did not know 
 it just so happens that on that morning he had stayed over night at her house and when she left for work she took his mobile phone the house phone and her keyboard with her so she could peruse his phone at her leisure at work without him being able to tell people he did n't have his phone etc 
 obviously because she still did n't trust him 
 well it turns out that the police decided to <unk> his car that day and with him unable to get in touch with anyone he had around a 3 hour walk to his <unk> house so he could sort his car out 
 oh and by the way that morning the woman found out there was a third woman involved with him when she took his phone that day so justice served : noise complaints are a common theme in <unk> 
 i have a nice story to tell that falls in that vein for sure 
 this is an <unk> version just the high or low points of the story 
 my best friend call her t '' and her husband call him c '' have a <unk> large brick <unk> behind their family home that serves as her husbands c 's practice area and recording studio 
 we can all get really loud in there without getting in trouble with the neighborhood or the cops 
 c 's dad call him pops '' is sort of one of those bleeding heart types 
 one day pops announces that c 's brother will be moving back in and he goes out and <unk> the studio and puts a second door in so that the brother we will call him ds '' for dipshit has a place to live while he is once again looking for a job ds ca n't hold a job cause he 's an alcoholic 
 well after all this happens needless to say when c is actually trying to do recording ds is blaring his shitty <unk> music 
 at one point ds has put the recording process 2 weeks behind right before c and t were to go on vacation 
 after informing needed people what was going on and explaining the situation to them they take off for vacation 
 after some discussion about what to do a plan was hatched ... <unk> 18 inch folded horn subwoofers 
 after they had been gone for a day or so i had gone in to do some work myself and even though they were gone the noise continued 
 time to enact the plan lined up the subwoofers in a nice w '' pattern wired them to the amps and set a tone generator for 10 <unk> signal and turned it up just loud <unk> that you could vaguely feel the <unk> in the outside wall but obviously could n't here it 
 that kind of noise is <unk> to say the least 
 it took 2 whole days to <unk> ds out of there and in the end we took out the door and knocked down the wall and got our happy and quiet studio back the way it was meant to be country music free 
 do n't blast your shitty music around people who have more power and equipment than you do cause you are n't going to <unk> up our yard backed up to the back yard of the neighbors behind us with a gate 
 they were a mormon family with 5 kids around our ages and we were <unk> friends with them so were always playing back and forth in each other 's yards 
 one day one of the girls invited my sister and i over to play and to show off the new swimming pool '' her father had bought for them it was one of those high sided hard plastic <unk> pools and invited us to jump in 
 this continued for a couple days 
 coming over to play as usual a few days later the kids told us that their father had told us we were n't allowed to play in the water because i swear i am not making this up we were <unk> '' and therefore would <unk> '' the water 
 my sister was about 8 years old and i was about 6 at the time 
 we may have been young but we knew enough to be really upset and hurt 
 and once it was explained to us by our parents just *exactly* he meant by that we were angry 
 really angry 
 a bit after this maybe a week or two we overheard the mother telling our mom that they would be gone for a week to go camping and if she would keep an eye on the house yep too filthy to wade in a <unk> pool but a great resource when they wanted something 
 a plot of revenge was planned between my sister and i. waiting until the day after they 'd left we spent the morning drinking lemonade 
 <unk> amounts of lemonade 
 and then we <unk> across the yards to their <unk> pool and proceeded to drain about two gallons of pee into the water 
 on the way back we also raided their large garden filling up on anything ripe enough to eat 
 i can not express the sense of satisfaction on hearing them gleefully splashing away the day they returned and the next day and the next unwittingly <unk> themselves in the bodily fluids of their dirty atheist neighbors 
 bonus : we overheard the mom complaining to our mom about how they were having to buy chicken wire for the garden to keep the animals out because they had lost so many <unk> 
 a summer my sister and i will remember fondly for the rest of our lives 
 my boss was the meanest and just like nastiest woman i have ever met 
 she was a terrible boss and was mean to every woman in the office she was really nice to the males though 
 she 'd make comments about our appearance our work and things that were <unk> to our jobs 
 she really knew how to hit below the belt 
 she told me that i should focus on my career instead of a relationship because i was n't the type of girl guys could ever commit to '' called a girl going on maternity leave <unk> 
 she told another girl that her heels were way too high and this was n't a <unk> house 
 she once even told me an assignment that i had worked really hard for and she had promised me i 'm just going to let chris and matt do it because i do n't think a girl could handle it '' lots of travel and <unk> involved like a day before i was supposed to get started 
 meanwhile she was <unk> <unk> the guys 
 saying things like its so nice to have an office full of real men '' and you guys can handle anything i would n't be anywhere without my team of boys '' 
 she was totally out of hand and inappropriate even they guys had noticed that her behavior was strange 
 anyway one night i spot her pretty drunk at some random bar flirting with every guy and was just really really <unk> overall 
 then i saw her take off her wedding and try and slip it into her pocket but because she was so drunk she had n't realized she had dropped it on the ground 
 i quickly pick it up and pocket it myself 
 at first i thought my revenge was to let her freak out about it for a little bit and then give it back to her later 
 but then she started making out with this random guy at the bar and i came up with a much better plan 
 i as <unk> as possible snapped a picture of her and the guy made sure to <unk> his face -- while making sure it was clearly her 
 anyway i kept the ring and took a picture with the ring on the <unk> of my male friend 's hand 
 the following monday i sent a pictures to her husband with a short note that i fucked your wife and she loved it so much she let me keep her ring '' 
 i sort of realized its not all plausible that she would give someone her wedding ring ... but i just ran with it 
 i kind hoped that the <unk> of the letter would be <unk> by her husbands rage 
 i ended up anonymously returning the ring as well it was clearly expensive and i felt too guilty keeping it and quitting a few days later as well 
 i never got a full follow up on the effects of my actions but i do know her and her husband separated after that from one of my old coworkers 
 edit : my grammar was pretty bad sorry 
 so this was years ago 
 i think i was <unk> 12 years old 
 this particular summer camp that i had been going to for a couple years had all their kids split up 
 boys and girls in their own camps and then different age groups had their own teepees lead by their team leaders who were usually high school aged kids 
 this year i was in the 3rd oldest group which happened to be the most populated group 
 there was always a bit of competition between the boys teams 
 this year things were getting heated 
 the big kids '' we 're beating us in almost every thing 
 paintball obstacle courses <unk> the zip line and floating dock at the pond 
 some of these things they got <unk> for and other rewards like smores or candy 
 the betrayal 
 one day while me and my buddy were catching <unk> out of a pond we heard some girls screaming and running out of their bathroom nearby 
 we run over to them to see what 's happening 
 apparently there was a rattlesnake that had <unk> its way into one of the stalls 
 so my buddy and i decide hell yeah 
 we 'll take care it '' 
 be the heroes for the ladies 
 so we pick up some long branches and rocks and start trying to kill the thing 
 well in the loud commotion from the screaming girls a few of the big kids '' came over and watched as my friend and i <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
 a few minutes later were coming out of the bathroom with our <unk> beast the big kids ganged up on us and took the rattlesnake for their own and showed it off to the rest of the camp as their trophy 
 they got extra smores that night an exclusive reward pretty much forest cred and made a trophy type thing with the snakes <unk> tail 
 <unk> 
 this was the last straw 
 the gathering of the <unk> 
 the next evening at the chow hall my friend and i informed the rest of our teepee what had really happened with the snake incident 
 we all decided something has to be done 
 we would n't let the big kids push us around any more 
 one of our teepee brothers was working in the kitchen that evening so when no one was looking he opened the back door to let us in the supply closet 
 my friend and i wrote on a few of the napkins secret meeting tonight blue teepee after chow '' 
 once we finished writing down our message we went around while plates and things were being passed out and slipped the napkins to each of the teepee leaders of the younger groups 
 about 8 o clock after dinner chow was over and the two older groups had gone left for a night hike all the younger teepees had met up by ours 
 we told them all about the snake thing how they had stolen it from us and claimed all the prizes and glory for their own 
 with this on top of all the other crap we had to put up with from the big kids we were all on the same page with getting revenge 
 our teepee leaders came up with our revenge plan 
 when i think back on it now it was pure genius sun tzu style planning 
 operation <unk> every year there was an <unk> pillow fight that happens between the teepees 
 it 's a winner takes all death match 
 any <unk> goodies were taken as prize for the winning teams and with it usually being the last big competition that happened for the summer it was very important to win as your teepee would go down in pillow fight history 
 while the big kids were still gone on their hike and the sun slipping away behind the distant <unk> our team leaders had all us kids collect our <unk> flashlights as many socks as we could find and our pillows 
 once we had all <unk> they began to lay out the plan 
 our long socks were rolled up in to balls and filled into our pillow cases 
 doing so ensured maximum damage '' to our opponents 
 next we had one of our fastest kids dressed up in all camouflage go scout out the path where the big kids would be returning from 
 he would <unk> <unk> back to us when he saw them coming and sprint back to join us 
 from there the rest of us would be hiding on the hill sides that surrounded the teepees with our flashlights and pillows ready 
 once the big kids returned in the dark of night they would be <unk> into the center of the grounds by our runner who would now be carrying the big kids teepee flag 
 then we attack 
 battle of <unk> the sun had retreated completely from view and the stars rose high into the sky shining even brighter as if excited for the battle to come 
 we got the radio call from our scout and everyone ran to their places 
 scout was now sitting in front of the enemies teepee <unk> the flag around when we saw their group marching back to camp 
 upon seeing the little kid in possession of their flag they all started yelling and gave chase exactly as we had hoped 
 in the center of the grounds was a <unk> luckily not one that can be tipped over that our scout ran into as protection from the big kids 
 he was now surrounded by both groups of big kids kicking and yelling for him to come out and get a beating 
 with them all distracted the battle was ready to begin 
 on the hills all around the camp a few dozen flashlights <unk> on blinding all the big kids in the center while battle cries rang and children charged from the hills with blood in their eyes and cotton <unk> in their hands 
 a fire had been lit earlier to make the surrounding woods seem darker in contrast 
 i wish i could have seen what it looked like from their point of view i 'm sure it was glorious and terrifying all the same 
 within a matter a minutes many of the big kids had already surrendered after taking a beating 
 bodies lit with the orange glowing light of fire and war dropping all around us in the chaos and confusion 
 some ran back to their teepees to find we had tied some of them together <unk> the pillows useless 
 it was a good fight 
 not to say we did n't lose a few good men 
 the big kids resorted to pinecones in the few pillows they were able to salvage 
 but alas we eventually won the fight and raided their teepee of all their <unk> chocolate <unk> and <unk> crackers 
 the rest of the night was spent around the camp fire all us kids enjoying some well earned smores while the big kids had received our kitchen cleaning duties 
 as delicious a revenge it was i was most happy about <unk> my rattle snake tail 
 blue teepee for life 
 yeah we *all* know the ex-lax revenge to the point where it is a <unk> let 's be honest 
 it works 
 first off keep in mind that this would legally count as battery '' <unk> putting that out there 
 typical story 
 years ago i worked in the admin dept 
 of a large university 
 our department handled security and parking operations 
 we had a shared <unk> as most offices do 
 also in typical fashion people began to notice that their lunches went <unk> if they did not go completely missing they noticed <unk> of it had been <unk> is even more gross 
 complaints followed but the perp was never identified and the lunch theft continued 
 someone and no it was *not* me decided to take matters into their own hands 
 the woman who did it owned up to me and gave me the details 
 she made something nice and delicious using a combination of chocolate and of course chocolate ex-lax : <unk> 
 she put it in the fridge with a note along the lines of shelly 's desert please do n't touch '' 
 come lunch time it was missing of course 
 around 2pm she observed one of the parking enforcement officers a complete moron and loser that nobody liked anyhow making a beeline for the men 's room 
 he then asked to leave because by his own graphic admission had a bad case of the shits '' 
 now i do n't know the rest of the details other than the fact that shelly '' confronted the guy and after that no more lunches were stolen 
 i was in an abusive relationship for two years 
 i do not have any type of support from family and my friends cut me off because i did not leave him right after he hit me in the face 
 i was so stupid for not leaving right away 
 two years had passed i finally able to believe in myself again and able to find a steady full time job 
 i slowly drift away from me and started to make new friends again 
 i slowly drift away and he started cheating on me 
 while he was in the bathroom he forgot to lock his iphone and i saw their messages to each other 
 i decided to seek revenge instead of confronting him and then day came when i got my revenge i met up with him in his place so we had some drinks and fortunately he got so drunk that he passed out 
 with my rubber gloves i went to his laptop and went to his facebook so i posted tons of <unk> items 
 i wrote something in his facebook status too stating he is gay and he is sleeping with buddy and that he can not hide his feelings for him anymore 
 on top of that when i was about to leave i saw a big jar full of weed so i flushed it in the toilet 
 i am not homophobic but he is 
 *** and i do not smoke weed 
 so that was the last day i saw him 
 he freaked out on me and he mentioned as to why i threw his weed and i told him to call the police on me as if as for the other woman fortunately she works at the women 's centre where i went for <unk> and she mentioned it to my ex and she also gave him my new address 
 i received a message from my ex and told me he will come see me at my new address so i decided to stay at a hotel 
 the week after i showed the text message to my <unk> and they terminated that woman and she got <unk> : a quiet saturday afternoon lot 's of rain <unk> 
 i was sitting in my room when the doorbell rang 
 not a rare occurrence by any means but it was what happened after that was really interesting 
 my dad opened the door and i peaked out from the <unk> above the door to see who had come 
 a man greets my father asks him if we 're selling the car out front 
 turns out even though it does n't say we are we have been thinking about it for quite some time 
 the man gives us this sob story about his landscaping business and his pregnant wife and how he really needs this a car 
 it seems legit and my initial <unk> <unk> down a little 
 he offers my dad $ 2k for a truck with 130,000 miles on it 
 not a horrible offer so my mom begins the required paperwork to hand over the title and make a bill of sale 
 she asks for his id and he hands it to her 
 this is where it gets really interesting 
 my mom was still somewhat <unk> out about a random stranger asking to buy a random car in our driveway that is n't for sale 
 it was weird not something that happens every day 
 and she was right 
 she looks up his name online and a massive slew of public documents and news stories about scammers buying high mileage cars and selling them for massive profit after turning back the <unk> shows up 
 this man was convicted of a massive fraud ring less than two years ago and is out on probation from federal prison 
 he 's at it again 
 i will link the news stories and court public record if allowed i know private information is <unk> upon so i will post without it initially 
 <unk> decided not to allow me to post this info 
 not sure if i agree since it is all public domain and what better revenge then to out these motherfuckers to the fullest 
 it is what it is i guess 
 ** my mom tells me to go outside and help my dad bail on this deal 
 my dad was outside helping the guy look at the car that shit would n't even start <unk> and i tell them that my friend has agreed to give us $ <unk> for it instead and that we were no longer interested 
 he gives me the lip and i basically tell him to fuck off subtly i think they know what 's up at this point and i told my dad secretly what was up 
 i 'm a big guy so the intimidation factor may have been enough to scare them off 
 my dad and i walk back inside thinking it 's over 
 it 's not over 
 my mom wrote down the man 's state id number and his address 
 after contacting the local authorities they told us to contact the attorney general 's office and we 've taken it upon ourselves to contact the local news station that ran the stories about him 
 updates in the near future are sure to follow 
 this is my first post so be kind 
 i 've just been reading all of your revenge stories so i just had to contribute my own 
 : as far as being bullied goes middle school is the worst time to be a kid regardless of your color <unk> etc 
 it 's a time when everyone is just starting puberty and all of this fear and confusion turns kids into cruel and <unk> <unk> 
 so imagine how much more confusing and <unk> it is to be a middle schooler when you are gay and when the most popular insult that get 's thrown around in the school yard is faggot '' 
 anyway i was realizing around then that i was a lesbian 
 i 'd never been popular but always had more <unk> than <unk> so my best friend was this kind of slovenly overweight <unk> boy whom i shall refer to as piggy 
 i made the mistake of telling piggy that i thought i was attracted to girls and he spread it all around the school as fast as his little piggy legs could carry him 
 even though no one had known who i was prior to my <unk> they sure as hell knew who i was then and never forgot to shout abuse at me when i walked by in the lunch room 
 in p.e 
 i wound up having to change in the bathroom to spare myself humiliation since all of the other girls avoided me like <unk> and were always making loud comments to one and other about how they felt like i was watching them when they changed 
 piggy was one of the people who tormented me the most and it hurt the most coming from him since we 'd been so tight in elementary school 
 yeah it was a fun three years 
 anyway come high school i thankfully made some new friends after finding my niche in band and people seemed to grow out of name calling to an extent 
 piggy also wound up going to the same high school as did most of our middle school class 
 piggy had a gorgeous sister who i 'll call lovely 
 lovely was a year younger than piggy was and was a freshman when i was a sophomore 
 lovely played the <unk> and we saw a lot of each other in band class as well as marching band 
 you see where this is going eh 
 well fast forward to my senior year and lovely and i have become very close friends 
 and by very close i mean i took her to prom 
 and here 's the kicker -- - piggy did n't have anyone to take to prom 
 i picked lovely up from piggy 's house and he was just standing there in a <unk> looking like a jerk <unk> alone while the two of us drove away 
 also you know how piggy was a homophobic prick in middle school 
 well he stayed that way in high school and was constantly spewing his hateful shit on facebook i only know this because lovely was his friend on facebook and if i wanted to i could see his stuff anyway since he had zero privacy settings 
 he did n't want to be associated with <unk> in any way 
 well lovely and i took heaps of photos at prom together and tagged him in every one of our pictures there were some where we were kissing each other on the <unk> and stuff nothing nasty 
 he <unk> himself of course but at least he got to know that somewhere out there people were looking at pictures of his own sister which proved that -- <unk> no -- - he was connected to a gay person 
 i wish we 'd <unk> some of the <unk> and not so passive but all out aggressive facebook posts he made afterwards 
 it 's really rough trying to play nice when you 've been <unk> in some way 
 and sometimes being mean is actually kind of awesome as this wonderful place has shown me 
 but in many cases revenge just is n't an option and it feels pretty good to just survive and let your happiness be a big f*ck you '' 
 to the ones who tried to screw with you 
 as <unk> as it is to consider asking lovely for piggy 's email and signing him up for every <unk> site imaginable i do n't feel that it is necessary now 
 i 've won 
 lovely and i are still friends now though i went out of state for college 
 piggy stayed home and went to community college and last i heard is still driven to school by his mother 
 i think the best part of my revenge is the fact that it was n't done deliberately at all ... life just decided i 'd had enough shit and gave me a karmic pat on the back while giving piggy a karmic kick in the behind 
 tl dr : i was <unk> as a lesbian in middle school by my <unk> best friend and wound up dating his sister in high <unk> is my brother 's revenge story 
 he was working for a software company in early 90 's or so 
 this is when companies were writing all kinds of programs to see what would sell 
 there was a guy who was a friend of all the programmers there 
 we will call him jimbob 
 jimbob was allowed to use the software they were programming 
 as he was their <unk> and all 
 this had been going on for sometime 
 then they found out he was selling the software behind their backs 
 did they confront him 
 nope 
 did they stop lending him the software 
 big nope 
 in fact they made sure he always got whatever new software they came up with 
 this went on for several months 
 where is the revenge you ask 
 well ... <unk> included a little extra code with all the software they let him try 
 when he made copies and sold the software the little extra code went with it 
 now this little bit of code was not included in the legal copies 
 what did the code do you ask 
 oh nothing much 
 just wiped the hard-drive and put a <unk> pumpkin on the screen that laughed at you 
 and if you cleaned your hard-drive and reinstalled the software it would automatically go off as the start date had passed 
 when did it go off you ask 
 why on halloween of course 
 he called them the next day about it 
 their response everybody who has a <unk> copy of our software is having no problems whatsoever '' 
 and that is when he realized he had been busted 
 he never asked for another piece of software from them ever again 
 picky nosy neighbors who have the president of the local <unk> 's association on <unk> are a real nuisance ... one day a few years ago my <unk> old volvo gave up the ghost ... the automatic transmission was slowly going out the final blow was when an oil line to an external oil filter developed a <unk> <unk> and the engine seized when all the oil escaped 
 i had the car towed home and it sat in the driveway for a month or so while i tried to decide what to do with it - the options being to replace both the engine and transmission or sell it off cheap either for parts or to someone who wanted to get it running again 
 i finally reluctantly decided to let it go - i 'd miss it as it had been probably the best car i 'd ever had and i 'd done some serious upgrades & amp improvement to it 
 about this time my neighbor called the hoa to complain that i had a junk car '' in the driveway that i was parting out to hear her version the president expected to see something on cinder blocks with no doors the hood up and no engine 
 the truth was that it was still <unk> with current license plates and insurance - there was no way to tell from looking at it that it was n't running 
 nevertheless i was given one week to either fix the car or have it gone 
 the <unk> neighbor was known for being extremely conservative - she made <unk> seem <unk> 
 one of the things which she had a particular dislike for was the local npr radio station which was associated with a local university ... the station was running a <unk> at the time so i decided to kill two birds with one stone - i donated the car to the radio station 
 the <unk> saturday came around and the car was being picked up by a tow truck when she came out to watch the proceedings with a smug look 
 she commented to me that it was about time that piece of junk '' was being removed when i replied that i 'd donated it to the local npr station her smug look was instantly replaced by horror quickly followed by livid anger 
 she stalked back into her house and slammed the door i was happy that even to the last my trusty volvo had been useful 
 edit : spelling <unk> is a bitch for abortion clinic protestors thanks to a brilliant <unk> todd stave has the <unk> position of being the landlord of a building in <unk> maryland which he <unk> to an abortion provider called reproductive health services clinic 
 so he knows a little something about dealing patiently with anti-abortion protesters 
 but when they started calling him at home at all hours and harassing his family he got fed up and came up with a very clever solution : do unto others as they have been doing unto you 
 problems really began for stave at the end of 2010 when he <unk> his building to leroy carhart one of the only doctors in the u.s. who openly <unk> that he performs <unk> <unk> 
 as you can imagine he 's a <unk> man and protesters come from far and wide 
 there is a constant group of them parked outside <unk> and holding up signs many of which have pictures of mangled fetuses 
 that 's pretty much a landlord 's nightmare and yet stave has a very calm attitude about it 
 he told <unk> <unk> of the <unk> post this week it 's their right 
 they are protected by the first amendment 
 and outside the clinic is probably the most appropriate place for them to express their views 
 if you 're wondering how stave can remain so relaxed about the situation he explains i 've been a member of this fight since <unk> <unk> wade 
 since i was 5 years old '' 
 you see the clinic used to belong to his father and then his sister ran it 
 when he was younger the office was <unk> and protesters were often gathered outside his dad 's house 
 so he 's used to a certain level of harassment and he 'll tolerate it — but only up to a point 
 and recently the usually calm cool and collected stave was pushed to his limit 
 it 's common practice for anti-abortion protesters to <unk> doctors personal information and urge people to harass <unk> it can clearly go far beyond that as with the 2009 murder of dr. george <unk> in <unk> 
 leroy carhart who 's now in stave 's clinic had his <unk> farm burned to the ground back in <unk> but protesters in maryland figured out they could start targeting stave for owning the clinic 's property 
 he was largely <unk> by this campaign until last fall when they took it too far 
 on his daughter 's first day in middle school a large group of people protested outside her school and then they showed up again for <unk> night 
 they were naturally carrying signs with his name and contact info and those nasty pictures of fetuses 
 stave was furious and then it got even worse 
 dozens of the protestors began calling him at home around the clock 
 his friends wanted to help him fight back that 's when stave had the brilliant idea of turning the tables on his <unk> 
 he began recording the names and numbers of the assholes who called and then he gave the list of info to his friends and asked them to call these people back on his behalf 
 <unk> 
 and the really smart part was that when someone from team stave called they always took the high road 
 he explains in a very calm very respectful voice they said that the stave family thanks you for your prayers 
 they can not terminate the lease and they do not want to 
 they support women 's rights 
 genius 
 while it was initially only a few friends doing the calling the group quickly <unk> 
 soon he was up to having 1,000 <unk> at his disposal 
 and they got <unk> too 
 they 'd look up information on the people who 'd placed unwanted calls to stave and then when they called they 'd drop the names of the person 's children or their school into the conversation 
 they 'd also said stave tell them that we bless their home on such and such street '' and then name their address 
 are you getting <unk> up you 're spine yet 
 stave 's calling force became so powerful that sometimes he was able to hammer an unwanted caller with up to 5,000 calls in return 
 looks like two can play at this game stalkers 
 stave 's approach was so <unk> that he was flooded with people from all over wanting to help 
 so he organized voice of choice which now has about <unk> <unk> 
 they do n't just fight back for stave anymore 
 they 'll make calls on behalf of whoever is being bullied by anti-abortion protesters whether it 's a doctor or a landlord or their family 
 when asked if he thought this method of payback was harsh stave said no : we gave them back what they gave us '' 
 actually not even 
 you gave back a mild <unk> version of what they gave to you 
 you proved to them that you know where they live and who their children are but you did n't show up at their homes and schools and threaten them 
 you did n't come onto their lawn with posters detailing terrible <unk> things that they 've done 
 you 're serving up revenge <unk> : <unk> great less killing 
 what 's more stave is strict about who voice of choice will make calls for 
 if it 's just <unk> protests outside clinics he wo n't help them because he believes in people 's first amendment right to be out there saying what 's on their mind 
 protestors must be personally harassing doctors or landlords in order for stave to step in 
 if only abortion opponents had the same respect for people doing what they were allowed by law to do 
 <unk> 
 so this is the part where the evil bullies who 've <unk> him and others at all hours of the day or night learn their lesson after having a taste of their own medicine right 
 yep yep 
 they all realized they were being horrible and now every anti-abortion protester is treating their <unk> opponents with the <unk> respect 
 ha 
 no 
 actually this is the part in the story where it gets much worse 
 ready 
 since voice of choice has been such a success stave was <unk> by <unk> in california last week 
 knowing that he was going to be out of town receiving the award his personal band of <unk> chose that moment to <unk> his neighborhood with fliers that had a photo of stave in a nazi uniform photos of <unk> victims and bloody fetuses 
 pause for a brief <unk> <unk> 
 of course the fliers had stave 's contact <unk> all of the phone numbers and addresses for other members of his family 
 this goes without saying but nevertheless : this is so incredibly fucked up 
 first of all the guy owns a building not a concentration camp 
 second of all what kind of person picks up a flier like that and thinks i need to get in touch with this nazi '' 
 god help us all 
 obviously stave 's daughter and all of his neighbors saw the fliers but the contact information for stave 's family members must have been spread around 
 because on monday an abortion protestor showed up at the <unk> office owned by stave 's brother-in-law and began doing his <unk> routine outside 
 that 's such a great idea — i 'm sure the random patient walking in for a cleaning is totally going to make the connection that the <unk> 's brother-in-law owns a building where there 's an abortion clinic and therefore abortion is wrong 
 at this point stave was back in town so he went over to confront the protestor 
 and when he got there the creep said how was your trip to san francisco '' 
 deep <unk> slow <unk> 
 it is amazing that people like stave have <unk> to stand up to <unk> like this coming at them from every direction but thank heavens they do because honestly the thought that these protesters get away with so much is <unk> 
 it 's hard to know where these <unk> will end when it comes to making stave 's life a living <unk> it 's probably not going to get any better now that he 's getting more and more national media attention 
 at least we know he 's got plenty of backup from voice of choice 
 the worse these people get the longer <unk> can keep them on the phone telling them all about the many <unk> and prayers '' they 're sending to their home addresses and to the locations of their children 's <unk> centers 
 then everyone will be so busy making and receiving calls that they 'll have less time to spend protesting outside clinics 
 and maybe in the future we 'll get to a magical place where both sides are talking to each other 100 percent of the time and a woman will be able to walk right up to the front door of an abortion clinic without being <unk> everyone will be so busy talking on the phone to their enemies to notice or care what she 's <unk> to do with her body 
 edit : added <unk> <unk> was the drummer in my friend 's band 
 some friend of his wound up becoming the bass player with one annoying habit 
 he was constantly late for practice and gigs and on a personal level was known to be a no show 
 so friend and i have dealt with his problem for almost two years but like idiots we agree to let him pick us up at a mall after another friend dropped us there 
 i know 
 we wind up stranded there until mall security throws us out at 10 walk to a <unk> 's in the snow and finally get someone on the phone this is <unk> days who is willing to come out in bad weather and let us stay at their place until we can get home the next day 
 we ask the bass player for a reason why he stranded us in the middle of the night 
 he gives us some lie which we later <unk> to be that he simply found something better to do with someone with drugs and now <unk> it is game the eff on 
 he moves to a trailer in ashland oh an hour drive south of us 
 invites us down to ashland to spend the evening go bowling drink be drunk and stupid and meet farm country girls courtesy of his fiance 
 okay 
 we load a cooler with beer we bring sleeping bags we prepare as young men expecting to bang farm girls might 
 two hours in the gravel parking lot of his shitty trailer park we have had beers and cooked on my <unk> and cursed this worthless pos far into the evening 
 just before dark we decide to <unk> his trailer 
 we pop out a screen on the lowest window i <unk> up and inside open the door and let my friend in 
 we moved all his furniture 
 we removed all books from shelves and piled them in <unk> we removed all light bulbs from everything and placed them in a bag in the freezer that way when he found them and put them in the <unk> would blow unless he <unk> them up 
 we ransacked the place but did n't destroy anything 
 loved what my friend wrote on his living room mirror in gf lipstick i think it was witness this '' 
 in reference to his <unk> as a <unk> 
 we piled all the big furniture against the only entry door which open out unfortunately jammed a <unk> and a chair against the low window we used to get in and then dropped out of the window <unk> from the ground 
 considered camping until he got home to see the reaction but who knew when and if this clown would ever show up 
 next band practice he shows up on time and heads straight for me and starts screaming in my face about breaking in to his trailer and fucking up his shit and his gf was crying in the parking lot and how dare we blah blah blah 
 my friend comes over and asks completely cool what is going on 
 he tells us that he came home the next morning and at that point my friend just loses it tells him he deserved it and i lose it except i 'm laughing thinking about this idiot <unk> himself into the window of the trailer and tripping trying to find his way around and find his light bulbs that are all going <unk> '' in freezer death because they 're too cold to light 
 not the greatest prank of my life but still the one that makes me chuckle the hardest 
 tl dr friend and i ransacked the trailer of an <unk> friend about 15 years ago when i was about 14 i went on a church trip to centrifuge in arizona or new mexico ... some <unk> <unk> state 
 sorry if you live there i 'm from mississippi so ca n't judge right 
 for those not in the know centrifuge is a massive once a year meetup for <unk> <unk> 
 anyway my dad is coming along as a chaperone 
 he 's on the bus and i 'm just getting on 
 someone bumps into the back of me i <unk> forward and bump into the guy in front of me 
 he gets mad grabs me by the collar and throws me at the wall of the bus 
 i was picked on a lot 
 i had no social skills and i put up with the abuse just to be around people who were popular 
 as far as my dad was concerned these shits had threatened his son 
 this as i would later learn was strike one 
 later on the bus they shot spit balls at my dad 
 this would be strike two 
 so we arrive in new mexico and immediately start <unk> this ... <unk> 
 it was huge numbers of dorms a <unk> course conference rooms etc 
 the perfect place for this big once a year christian meetup 
 turns out the desert gets cold as well as hot 
 we had all packed for summer but it was <unk> and cold as hell 
 my dad <unk> man that he is picked up a pair of <unk> for me and him 
 he also gave me an early birthday present : the 4th harry potter book 
 so i get all <unk> in my sleeping bag and start reading 
 everyone else stays out until they are super tired and crash 
 few had the energy to make their bunk beds livable so they froze 
 now before everyone got to sleep a chaperone announced he knew that the older kids had shaving cream and they should give it up and not use it to cream their fellow campers 
 a few sample size cans were given up 
 the next morning i wake up covered in shampoo 
 these assholes had put shaving cream everywhere along with shampoo on all my clothes 
 they even emptied out toothpaste onto my stuff 
 that night i slept cold because my sleeping bag was ruined 
 strike 3. now centrifuge is very <unk> structured 
 the whole day is running around learning about jesus with 1 hour <unk> at night before lights out 
 well my dad was <unk> behind that morning ... after everybody left for morning worship my dad stayed behind 
 he went into the older kids room the ones largely <unk> and poured their shampoo toothpaste and shaving cream all over their <unk> 
 pillows 
 <unk> bedding 
 toothpaste 
 those little <unk> <unk> pillows 
 <unk> so then my dad just goes to church worship with the rest of us 
 we all return and holy hell are they mad 
 you know what 
 it was probably those texas boys upstairs 
 there was almost a fight between us <unk> defending the honor of our bedding and the <unk> texas boys who had no idea wtf was going on but sure as shit were n't going to have their honor insulted either 
 <unk> <unk> i.e 
 my dad smiled 
 he later told me he was disappointed that the fight never happened and hoped the texas boys <unk> their ass 
 finally one of the <unk> who knew my dad was late that morning asked him if he did it 
 he said he did 
 they started yelling at him 
 i went outside and caught the tail end of the conversation 
 they told my dad i should stand up for myself against a <unk> of older kids 
 my dad just said i thought he needed a little <unk> intervention '' 
 and that 's why my dad is <unk> 
 edit : this is my first post if its pettyrevenge my bad 
 i did n't know 
 <unk> pillows man <unk> business 
 edit : there 's a lot of debate about this being pro or not 
 this was my first post and first time <unk> this subreddit 
 i already copied it to petty revenge 
 the only reason i have n't taken it off <unk> is because it 's clear a large enough audience enjoyed the story 
 you 're free to <unk> all you want but please stop arguing <unk> yourselves 
 thank you 
 i want to start off saying i gave up on revenge long ago and adopted the do n't wish bad on others wish good on yourself '' <unk> as if your wish comes true one benefits you while the other 's worthless 
 that being said here 's one of my last acts of revenge from freshman year of college 10 years ago 
 my dorm was a 3 story <unk> 
 i lived in a double on the first floor and had a quad and triple of freshman above me 
 i admittedly was a little intense my first semester of college but i always tried to make friends rather than problems 
 for whatever reason all the other freshman in the dorm started to <unk> and exclude me except my roommate 
 it was really lonely and i felt really unwanted and fucking insecure all the time 
 it got to the point they did n't talk to me or go near my room if i was there 
 march of that year i went home for a weekend 
 when i came back i found my cookie crisp was gone i bought cereal for breakfast as it was n't included in my meal plan 
 it was all i had in the morning and my tissue box was empty that still <unk> me the fuck out 
 my roommate told me it was the freshman who <unk> me 
 i calmly went to ask about it and ask why and they immediately put on angry faces told me to calm down and they would replace it that night 
 well hours pass and they did n't leave 
 the school store was closing soon so i went up stairs and politely asked jimmy the guy the douches all followed if he could please go soon so i would have breakfast in the morning 
 he grumbles and says ok. another hour passes and the stores close to closing nobody went 
 i politely ask again and jimmy says i 'm not going and i 'm not going to let you <unk> me into it '' 
 well that 's nice but that 's not the decision you made when you ate my breakfast '' 
 what do you mean breakfast 
 what time you wake up 
 what time is your class 
 why do n't you eat in the cafeteria 
 none of these questions matter you ate it you replace it '' 
 he stomps off into his room 
 at this point i stop being <unk> and know what to do ok jimmy ... i 'm gon na take a shower '' 
 the douchebag left all his toiletries in the bathroom which was a small one toilet one bathtub bathroom for 9 college dude 
 i got in for my shower and proceeded to piss in his yellow shampoo and then as quickly as i could move jizz in his <unk> <unk> his hand soap and face bar <unk> his toothpaste it was hard to make sure i got it everywhere and no clear signs of it but i got it to work 
 i did n't tell a soul for a year and i do n't think i told anyone about the toothpaste for a little longer 
 i did n't care if he mouthed off to me afterwards 
 i already ruined it for him 
 tldr : <unk> stole my cookie crisp so i <unk> in his toothpaste 
 **the background** so this is back around <unk> 
 i grew up in a pretty cool neighborhood but we had that one house 
 you know the one with the elderly couple with not a god damn thing to do 
 they did all the typical stay off my lawn '' 
 bs 
 where i felt they took it to a new level however is when my friends and i were playing ball they would wait in the garage 
 one would peek through the window and the other had their hand on the button 
 so as soon as a ball started rolling in the direction of their house the door starts opening and here comes <unk> to steal it 
 it got to the point that one of my buddies <unk> over there and kicked the ball away as the guy was bent over to pick it up 
 he did n't like that 
 tried to accuse everyone of assault 
 he also called the police each time he stole one of our balls 
 this despite them repeatedly telling him that a ball rolling over your lawn is not trespassing but taking it is stealing 
 **the <unk> up until now they were annoying but not much else 
 at the time i had the most awesome dog tiger 
 he was a stray that came to live with us a few years earlier but he still liked to wander a lot too 
 just as dogs are want to do and at the time letting your dog out was still common 
 well my neighbor would call the dog <unk> every day 
 not because he was shitting or pissing or digging up his lawn because he walked through it 
 that 's it 
 so eventually it comes down to we need to fence in the dog or lose him 
 we build a fence all the way around the property just so tiger can <unk> his way out again and again 
 he was a super cool freakin ninja dog 
 long story short he kept finding new ways to get out because that 's how he wanted to live and it resulted in us <unk> him for good 
 i was apoplectic i genuinely wanted to murder the old bastards 
 i eventually came to my senses and resolved to ruin what he loved instead 
 **the revenge** they absolutely <unk> their stupid grass 
 he cut it 3-4 times per week <unk> it daily 
 you will think i am joking but i am in the <unk> 
 of the u.s. and he had a second snow <unk> that he set up to get the snow off the lawn with out tearing out the grass 
 ridiculous 
 costco was new at the time and my dad did n't pay much attention to the stuff we threw into the cart 
 so that is how i came to be in possession of 40 lbs 
 of salt 
 we were leaving for a week at the shore the next morning so about 3 am i was spreading salt 
 it took a few days to kill the grass so i was a few hundred miles away when *** '' asshole '' *** appeared in 5 foot tall letters extremely visible from the street 
 by the time i got back he had <unk> the whole thing 
 luckily friends had taken pictures of the lawn and themselves giving thumbs up from the sidewalk 
 i can still picture old man n watching that <unk> through the garage window 
 in my mind it is <unk> to <unk> <unk> with lots of lip <unk> impotent rage and <unk> 
 **edit** love how much discussion something i did 20+ years ago when i was 14-15 can create 
 to clarify the dog did not run away 
 he was sent to live on a farm '' <unk> 
 put down 
 this is the only dog i did n't raise from a <unk> 
 as i said tiger was a street dog that took us in more than we took him in 
 picture <unk> from the <unk> movie 
 we were lucky enough that he liked hanging out with us 
 i do train any animal that i am keeping as a pet 
 this dog had his own separate identity above and beyond that 
 that is why he was so awesome 
 he did n't need us he was with us because he wanted to be 
 **edit 2** how has nobody even <unk> using a snow <unk> on the lawn yet 
 i thought that was the craziest part of the story 
 i am 100 % serious that he would spend an insane amount of time every <unk> clearing off what was about a 40 x 60 front lawn 
 i was in class a few years ago and the little shit behind me was poking and kicking my seat i was fairly quiet in class he was not 
 so i turned around while everyone was taking notes and the teacher was writing on the board picked up his text book threw it across the room and it slammed off the floor 
 i quickly went back to writing before the book hit the ground 
 so there he was no book and no one buying his story about me doing it and he gets sent to the principal 's <unk> in college i met a girl through my classes we became <unk> 
 she would often come over to my apartment to work on stuff together 
 a couple months later found out she was bad mouthing me to my roommate who she was trying to hook up with 
 i ended up breaking things off with her but kept her added on facebook 
 i find out that she is getting an engaged to another indian guy she was indian herself 
 i ended up adding her fiance 
 started talking to him turns out he was under the <unk> his precious fiance was a virgin 
 i told him that i had sex with her he asked her she completely denied it and he ended up deleting me afterwards 
 turns out my roommate who bad mouthed me still had naked pictures of her i ended up sending them through a fake facebook account to him 
 found out a bit later that they ended breaking up 
 i do n't know i actually feel good about it 
 told a few of my friends all my female friends said i was an asshole while my guy friends think i did the right thing 
 now i know many people might not agree with indian culture about virginity and all and that’s perfectly fine 
 but to this guy it meant a good bit he saved himself for marriage and expected his wife to had done the same 
 you can say when she was younger she <unk> and all but if that is the case she should have told him and let him judge whether he wanted to stay or not 
 instead she lied to him and wanted to marry him under false <unk> 
 i know i was n't doing it out of a good heart 
 but that being said can we say that i did the right thing for the wrong reason 
 if you were the guy would n't you want to know 
 <unk> me an asshole but if she gets engaged to another <unk> indian <unk> i will definitely tell him too 
 ** **edit** for those of you saying that indian culture is so <unk> and <unk> 
 am i not doing her a favor saving her from such a <unk> culture '' 
 if she has to lie about her virginity to a guy because he wo n't accept her otherwise is it <unk> <unk> 
 i am saving her from a life time with a guy that does n't value her 
 that way she can find a more sex positive guy 
 so here 's the deal : i go to school at <unk> 
 i 'm a medical student and i live in a building that is 10 minutes from the hospital 
 it 's a nice building and every apartment has at least a full bedroom and a living room 
 each floor has a boys bathroom and a girls bathroom and each consists of a number of stalls along with 5 or 6 showers 
 due to policy and at the request of other occupants the building 's only cameras are out front and in the back 
 lately there 's been this guy going around and taking shits in the showers 
 the first time it happened it was on the second floor i live on the fifth 
 a student walked in early in the morning before class and said that it was right over the drain 
 personally i found this to be incredibly funny and thought nothing of it assuming it was a <unk> prank 
 the following tuesday on the sixth floor it happened again 
 needless to say us students did n't find it as funny this time around 
 from this point on everybody was extremely cautious when stepping into the showers 
 on thursday it happened once more 
 this time was different though 
 it happened on my floor 
 to be more specific it happened to me when i stepped into the shower 
 i was not lucky enough to see it before i stepped in it 
 this was becoming personal 
 i was so pissed that i even called the staff to complain 
 they said that since we did n't know who it was and due to the <unk> policy they could n't do anything about it at the time 
 i then took it upon myself to find a solution 
 i spent the next week planning my revenge 
 throughout this week the <unk> had become more frequent 
 it happened almost every day 
 i figured it had to be someone in the building because according to the building staff no one had been coming <unk> every day who was not a resident 
 eventually i had <unk> it down to two revenge plans : 1. wait it out let somebody else handle it then extract my revenge later on whoever did this 
 the problem with this plan was that whoever did it was sure to be <unk> 
 at least kicked out of the building 
 i wanted to either be the cause of this or make this awful person suffer more 
 2. i was going to find out who the midnight shitter was and turn him in after i had executed whatever i was going to do to this monster 
 i decided to go with option 2 and the problem now was how to find out how to catch the person 
 i could try a camera but that would be an invasion of both building policy and the law 
 you can not but a camera in a bathroom 
 the other option was to gather several of other occupants who i knew could not be the shitter and stand guard outside the bathrooms 
 once again i went with option two 
 me and twelve residents stood outside the bathrooms on each floor and pretended to be texting 
 there were six floors and we each took shifts throughout the night 
 whoever was the shitter must have heard of our plans because nothing had happened for the first two nights of doing this 
 on the third night however my luck <unk> 
 i saw a student go into the bathroom i was watching 
 he was on my floor but i did n't talk to him 
 he was new and he had recently transferred from <unk> 
 he walked in and i waited 
 no shower sounds no toilet flushing 
 i peeked into the bathroom slightly and looked 
 no one was in the stall 
 i then slowly scoped the outside of the showers until i saw a small shadow inside the last one 
 i had finally found this man 
 since he was on my floor i knew all about the guy 
 we will call him jim 
 jim was a man of indian decent 
 he had several friends who i knew of and both were in classes with me 
 the next monday i approached one of them 
 i explained my whole situation and we hatched a plan together 
 the plan was that this friend was going to spend the night at jim 's place then let me in when jim was asleep 
 i was then going to enter with 3 bags of cow manure and pour them all over the apartment 
 then in the morning i was going to report him to the proper authorities 
 surprisingly enough my whole plan worked and he was evicted from the building 
 **tl dr : this guy at my college shits in all the showers so me and another guy put cow manure in his apartment then report him 
 <unk> so here 's the thing 
 when i moved to australia about 9 years ago i was 9 now 18 and had no friends 
 this was understandable but the sad part was that no-one wanted to be my friend 
 i did everything wrong i sat with the wrong <unk> i said the wrong thing i acted like a 5 year old when something serious was going on i acted like a 20 year old when some game was happening every little thing just went wrong for me 
 then this amazing person became my friend 
 i 'll call her sophie <unk> to protect her identity because that would be going a little far 
 anyway sophie was my first real friend here and i met her after easily 3 years with literally not a single friend in the <unk> 
 we did pretty much everything together and later she introduced me to her own friends and we very quickly bonded 
 now this was fine for about 2 years 
 i had a great best friend who was warm and friendly to me and i had a great group of new friends who were interested in science fiction and classic literature and all the other nerdy things i liked 
 and then i got my diagnosis of <unk> 
 this was n't something i <unk> about or anything i kept this information close to my chest telling only the people i thought i could trust most in the world 
 apparently this did not extend to my best friend little miss <unk> 
 she went screaming about how i was a freak a liar a retard and a pervert where did she get that one from 
 and yes all of these and more were her actual words 
 it got so bad i tried to kill myself on three separate occasions 
 it turned out she had a serious problem with anyone she perceived as mentally ill and held virtually neo-nazi views about what should be done with mentally disabled people 
 i vowed absolute total revenge on this bitch who had ruined my <unk> life 
 we ended up <unk> a little mostly verbally until after about 6 months of this we just sort of <unk> into furious silence 
 she should have remembered that i was the winner of the prize for science in my school for 3 years running 
 after about 2 more months i got really sick of her shit 
 i still had my old friends from before but my former best friend was now my absolute nemesis 
 i trusted her with everything and now she was using that against me telling people i was <unk> hey did you know the nutjob is a faggot too 
 that i had <unk> 's yeah like that retard on youtube '' and that i liked star <unk> and old <unk> movies and things what a fucking nerdy bitch '' 
 i found my way onto ebay and bought 8 <unk> of <unk> % pure <unk> <unk> 
 i then went to the local shops and got some disposable pitchers and a few bottles of <unk> 
 if you mix these up in a certain <unk> you get a highly volatile chemical called nitrogen triiodide 
 this is also known as explosive paint 
 later that night i went to her house and painted this stuff around her door handle 
 her door is one of the ones where if you turn the handle on one side the other turns too 
 i also painted it under the wheels of her car and under her welcome mat 
 since nitrogen triiodide will explode with a small amount of force and a <unk> loud bang when touched or moved leaving an <unk> yellow stain this might be quite interesting 
 fast forward a little 
 i come back four days later 
 there 's a deep yellow stain on the door handle and on her driveway 
 two of her tyres have the same mark two others look new i later found out from a co-worker of hers that they burst for some reason '' 
 turning over her mat there are deep yellow and black <unk> in it 
 i did this again only this time on her bike wheels and under her window which i heard from her boyfriend had been replaced very <unk> since she thought she broke it because of the cracking sound a week later 
 she 'll never know it was me specifically but i have a fair idea 
 she 's stopped calling me names in the street which is something and i may even have the restraining order 200 metres lifted if she keeps up this enforced good <unk> was a couple years back 
 the drummer of this band we shared our practice space with accused us of cutting him short on our portion of the rent which we definitely had n't 
 he emailed us saying we now owe two months rent and that he was friends with the building manager who could kick us out he did n't 
 we told him we knew he was full of shit to which he challenged us to a fight in the park because that 's what adults do 
 we decided it was sketchy to just leave our gear in that room where they could get to it so we drove down that day to move it all out 
 we get there and there are two new padlocks on the door 
 bad move 
 we come back at 2am and cut the locks off with bolt cutters 
 we get in and grab our gear 
 i knew the drummer <unk> a bottle of <unk> inside his kick drum through the front hole so i get it out and proceed to top it off with a nice minute long piss that i 'd been holding on the bart ride over and then put it back 
 i then <unk> all the bottom heads of his drums for good measure 
 finally we installed a new door handle and locked it from the inside and three new padlocks on the outside 
 we heard from a friend in a band in a spot down the hall that it took their drunk asses two weeks to get their shit together enough to get back in there 
 i 'm pretty sure he drank that piss rum too because <unk> smells much stronger and is much darker 
 there 's no way he could 've known 
 but we do 
 and now you do 
 and that 's all that matters 
 after reading <unk> 's tale of <unk> a scumbag driver it inspired me to tell you guys about a very similar tale that happened to myself and my so one afternoon a few months ago 
 my so is 23 with an open license but currently no car 
 he grew up working on cars with his dad and has had more <unk> jobs from rentals to detailing to mechanics than i can count 
 he loves cars and knows more about them than anyone i 've ever met 
 he has owned many cars and is a <unk> but mostly responsible driver 
 he has a friend who is young and does not yet have a license but had recently gotten a supposedly great deal on a kinda <unk> looking bmw no idea what kind i 'm a chick and i do n't know jack about cars which he lent to my so for a few days to run errands since without a license he ca n't drive it anyway 
 so my so comes over with the car one day after offering to take me to an appointment 
 when we go downstairs we both have a laugh at it 
 it has a terrible <unk> paint job a huge crappy wing hanging off it and those stupid rear window <unk> from car accessory manufacturers that losers think will make them go faster 
 it screams <unk> street cred 
 it 's quite nice on the inside though tan leather interior and everything and my so tells me that his friend did in fact get a good deal as the car has low mileage and is in great working condition 
 i was also surprised to learn that it 's <unk> as fuck 
 on the way back from my appointment we 're cruising down the highway 
 there 's about 6 lanes going in each direction and every few hundred metres or so there 's a steel <unk> that goes over the road with digital led speed signs hanging down 
 <unk> the speed limit was set to <unk> which is normal considering it was a quiet afternoon with not a whole lot of cars on the road and the only one near us was a dark blue sedan just ahead in the lane left of us 
 we 're just chilling listening to the radio with the windows down when a white <unk> 90 's holden commodore aussies will see where this is going passes us on the right 
 we do n't notice them at this point but when they get about two car lengths ahead of us we see arms <unk> from the left side of the vehicle and motioning at the blue sedan 
 the blue car 's windows are rolled down but nothing seems to be happening so the commodore moves into our lane to drive alongside them 
 an arm comes out of the holden 's passenger side window waving an unopened can of xxxx gold beer now for <unk> xxxx gold and <unk> are both huge bogan <unk> and go together like <unk> <unk> and <unk> pants go with <unk> kids 
 you see the two things together and can usually conclude with about 95 % accuracy that the owner of those things is a bogan 
 anyway at this point it has become clear that the blue sedan is carrying a number of women and the guy in the holden 's passenger seat is <unk> the lady driver a beer* 
 thankfully it 's not working 
 the women <unk> into the lane to their left and hang back to escape 
 the holden dangerously follows but not before <unk> an empty <unk> out the window 
 at this point my so decides to intervene 
 we also move to the left with the holden in front of us and the sedan to our left 
 the women look a bit scared and again change lanes to their left so we take their spot and speed up til we 're alongside the holden again 
 they realise what they 've gotten into and now move to the right to escape us 
 we follow 
 at this point almost all of the traffic is in the left lanes and we 're in the right lanes 
 we look over at them and the passenger <unk> our <unk> and flips us off right as the driver plants his foot on the accelerator 
 there 's no one ahead of us and my so looks at me and says <unk> this 
 this little <unk> knew how to go and go it did 
 we sped right up past them and made sure to be only just ahead of them 
 they seemed surprised by our swift <unk> and would get faster and faster to try and catch up but we made sure to always stay juuuust in front 
 at just over <unk> we pull back slightly and quickly move into the clear left lane 
 as i previously mentioned it was a quiet afternoon and so there was a fair distance between cars in the <unk> lanes 
 we pull back some more and duck to the left again then again and then one last time as we resume cruising at the speed limit <unk> with all the other cars 
 as this is happening we see the holden continuing to <unk> along at top speed apparently unaware that we were no longer trying to tail them 
 now my so is quite competitive and i know he would never give up that easily especially where cars are concerned 
 i ask him why he let the guy go and he replies 'babe you know i 've been driving around here a long time 
 i know this road like the back of my hand 
 i also know exactly which of those led speed signs hanging overhead have hidden speed cameras behind them 
 i just gave them a little <unk> now they 'll be receiving a nice little present in the mail 
 sure enough we had <unk> out just before the camera while the d-bags had shot straight through it 
 **tl dr** possibly drink driving <unk> litter and scare women on the highway get tricked into going <unk> through speed camera 
 edit : <unk> off sorry for the amount of text so this all happened a few years ago in sixth form this guy had pulled a few pranks on me nothing spectacular just stuff like filling my bag with dry leaves taking the ink out my pens etc 
 i knew i had to get him back so i devised a diabolical plan ... now a little background info there were loads of lockers in my school far too many in fact and so there were always a lot of lockers free so with more padlocks you could just take more lockers 
 other background is that we both had double chemistry on wednesday mornings and completely free afternoons oh and also this guy cycled to school and got changed and left his things in his locker **now for the revenge : ** stage one : i started preparing the friday before the planned revenge on the following wednesday i did so by bringing every single padlock that i could find into college and taking as many lockers spread as far around the school as possible especially targeting numbers with some <unk> to them like <unk> etc stage two : i began writing <unk> about 20 of them they were no <unk> masterpieces but i tried my hardest to make them challenging <unk> and require knowledge of all things <unk> literature art <unk> history science and <unk> <unk> and cryptic clues also the answer to each clue gave the location or number of a locker except one which led to a person who had the next riddle on him i had made sure that the intended victim and the riddle holder had never before met 
 stage three : i put each riddle and the key to the next locker in an envelope with a large question mark printed on it and then put these in the corresponding lockers the day before the prank all was now in place for the prank to go smoothly stage four : prank day is now upon us i make sure to walk to chemistry with the victim and remind him we need to get our lab coats from our lockers this <unk> the last time he sees his locker full he is with me we walk up to chemistry i have arranged for a friend of mine to <unk> his lab coat so he has to go down and get his from his locker he goes down to get but quickly takes all the stuff from the victims locker puts it in another places the first riddle in the victim 's locker and <unk> it 
 he then returned to the chemistry locker 
 stage five : the chemistry lesson is over i return with the victim to our lockers to put our <unk> away but wait what 's this 
 all his stuff his gone 
 o no what a surprise he does n't know what 's happened 
 he reads the riddle the <unk> of the situation hits him <unk> i can see the <unk> <unk> around in his head about even the first riddle i make my excuses and go home at this point its about 12 o clock and leave my victim to search for his stuff with a few of his friends trying to help him 
 the aftermath : i return to school the following day to find that the riddled <unk> did n't manage to find his stuff until just after 7 in the evening and boy o boy is he mad especially as his stuff was in the locker next to his with the pretty difficult code <unk> he 's got a few suspects and unfortunately one of them is me i remind him that it could n't possibly be me as i was with him the whole time but go ahead with revenge against a particularly douchey mcdoucherson whom is also a suspect by <unk> planting a question mark envelope in his bag now my riddled victim has decided to just look through his prime suspects bags and lo and behold what should he find but evidence of the crime in douchey mcdoucherson 's bag 
 so now victim a is furious with victim b and swears revenge upon him for the rest of the year he was <unk> with douchey mcdoucherson 
 tl dr <unk> web of <unk> leads prankster on 7 hour search for his belongings and carefully planted evidence results in douchey mcdoucherson taking the blame for some 2 in 1 <unk> i used to work for hallmark when i was 18 and there was this one guy there who was the biggest douchebro i 've ever met i mean he dressed and acted like someone from the jersey shore this was before the jersey shore so i guess in his own way he was a hipster too and he carried this knife that he kept in a holster under his <unk> like a detective might carry his gun now despite working with boxes all day the only time i ever saw him use it was to cut your drink bottle very <unk> so as you did n't notice the hole <unk> you went to take a <unk> and got covered in cola or whatever it was that you were drinking well he did that to me one too many times and i thought right i 'm going to fix this prick so i grabbed a whole bunch of david <unk> cards he was wearing jeans laying down with no shirt and proceeded to plaster the passenger side and rear of the car with them along with <unk> such as i <unk> the cock and honk if you take it up the arse i feel i have to mention that i have no problems with <unk> people but knew he did so anyway he drives off without seeing them and the next day he gets into work and is looking for blood apparently these other guys started honking their horn and pointing and laughing at him at which point douchebro starts <unk> his at them you know the <unk> douchebro gesture for come on then '' any way basicly he 's copping it the whole way home and when he gets back to his parents house his family 's on the porch and they all start laughing at him at this point he turns around to view my <unk> and just loses it it was alot of fun watching him stomp around the factory trying to figure out who was responsible but he never did 
 this next story is n't my personal revenge it was more like the <unk> revenge against this same douchebro 
 so anyways every wednesday all the young <unk> in the factory would go down the local for a couple of drinks and to play texas hold em but this one day we ended up far drunker then normal and i was spilling my drinks everywhere so i decided to head home so i 'm doing the rounds saying goodbye to everybody when i spot the douchebro up ordering a drink at the bar i get there just as the douchebro gets his drink and sparks up a smoke now this was like a week after the ban on smoking in bars came into effect so the bartender asks him nice as pie to take it out in the beer garden he did n't even ask him to put it out to which dudebro responds with fuck you you dog cunt '' at this point i 've taken like six steps back and am fully in the we got a badass here pose and decide to get while the <unk> good so i go over the road to hungry jacks and order a <unk> 
 as i 'm sitting at the counter drunkenly <unk> on my burger when i spot at least 2 cop cars and a <unk> van pull into the pub across road i know this has <unk> to do with the douchebro so i head back across the road and arrive just in time to witness douchebro getting chucked in the back of the <unk> van <unk> i then head back inside to see what happened apparently douchebro got asked to leave by one of the bouncers and he flashed his knife the one in the holster and told him to fuck off '' and then thought he could keep playing poker like they were n't going to call the cops 
 so douchebro gets into work an hour late the next day with the biggest black eye you 've ever seen and asks all the guys not to say what had happened we were all like you 're too late we told that guy and him and him '' douchebro turned red and walked out and we never saw him again 
 oh and the best part was that he was studying to be a p.e teacher but as he got charged with making threats to kill carrying a concealed weapon and a whole other bunch of charges which would ensure he would never pass a working with <unk> check he basicly flushed all that down the <unk> story may be a little longer for which i apologize but there is a small back story that is needed to fully explain why i went so far in my revenge 
 i should also say for those <unk> out easily or equally offended easily maybe dont keep reading 
 although this seems to be an subreddit of epic revenges so im in the right place some years ago i moved into a small apartment with an old friend when my partner and i fell on hard times 
 i should also mention that my partner was chronically ill and i was effectively a <unk> for her while working fulltime to support us and studying fulltime 
 needless to say i was stressed 
 the friend who was also a old high school girlfriend whom ill refer to as cc for crazy cunt had accepted that we move in on short notice due to a previous housemate almost killing my partner the week before through negligence 
 there were warning signs i should have spotted on moving in with cc but frankly we were that grateful for a roof over our head that i overlooked them 
 thus follows events that occurred that built up the rage that lead to revenge over the following 3 months : * when moving into the house i personally had done all the lifting and <unk> of cc 's stuff out of rooms so could move my stuff in then moved in every item of furniture myself 
 you might say fair enough as she 's letting me in but this is up 3 flights of stairs 
 fridges washing machine couches ... u get the idea not one bit of help even on the small stuff 
 * cc was also a crazy cat lady 
 she had a cat she was not allowed to have 
 this thing was also fucking <unk> 
 if this cat was spotted on the windows or any door was even cracked slightly where the cat could get out or if she thought it was she would go fucking ballistic 
 <unk> <unk> but more about the cat later * moving in i took over <unk> of the rent and yet cc intentionally <unk> the only common <unk> with her druggie boyfriend at any time she was not at work 
 in this common room she would play romantic shitty movies at loud volume yet the tiny <unk> room see <unk> i used as a study even listening to something at talking volume was apparently too loud for her and would constantly have a go about it 
 * this cat would attack you at any chance it had 
 teeth and <unk> 
 yet cc thought this was cat just being friendly and would blame us for scaring it 
 still have scars from that fucking thing 
 * cc was the laziest dirtiest bitch ive ever known 
 this was shown through two things 
 the first was that myself and partner took a two week holiday camping at some point 
 before we left we had asked her to clean the mass of dishes she had created and take out the single bag of garbage that was starting to smell funny 
 2 weeks is enough time right 
 we got home and opened the door of the apartment and the smell ... .was ... <unk> 
 the original bag was still there with 2 full bags of rotting junk food and meat 
 there was also not a clean dish in the house with it all piled up on the sink 
 upon getting back she was hungover on the couch with her idiot boyfriend and expected us to clean it up for her 
 * cc had complained non stop about how much of a horrible housemate her previous shared living people had been 
 all of them 
 this raised alarm <unk> but i should have realized how much 
 cc had <unk> against all of them and intentionally fucked with them and their lives whenever she could 
 this we found out when my partner borrowed cc 's contact solution and it immediately burnt her eyes 
 a previous tenant had added dishwashing soap to try and get revenge on cc 
 * the cat 
 she never changed the kitty litter and what she fed that damned thing stank when it came out 
 this was in a tiny apartment with the litter box in the shared and cramped <unk> 
 most showers would be spent gagging and dry <unk> 
 despite repeated requests to fix it cc would carry on like a petulant teenager and rarely do anything about it 
 also more about this later 
 * the usual stories of shitty housemates of stealing food and clothing items and/or selling them to pay for getting <unk> on the weekend applied as well 
 so after just under 3 months we had had enough 
 there was more but those are the easiest to explain it would probably be double the length if i covered everything 
 so a plan was formed 
 we were going to wait for her to go out to work for the day them move out in style 
 as soon as she was gone we pulled the trailer around and started loading up all our furniture 
 this was also when we started discovering some things 
 at some point cc had set fire to and burnt all of our tea towels 
 strange but thats what we found 
 as well as that she had not been putting the kitty litter in the bin after all 
 instead she had been <unk> it and then double <unk> it and then pulling it <unk> in a <unk> tub in the same bathroom 
 had moved it maybe a <unk> which explained why the smell never ever left the room let alone the apartment 
 she had spent a time telling us it was old clothes she was storing ... so first of all we called up cc 's rental agency and told them we would be moving out and it turned out she had never informed them we were moving in nor about any of the previous tenants 
 this was a major breach of her contract which was effectively guaranteed she was going to be evicted no matter what 
 but we decided to add photos and video of the cat she had and playing with the cat which meant she had broken her contract further meaning she <unk> a $ 500 fine to clean and <unk> the apartment following her eviction 
 it was satisfying knowing that she had been in there for 2 years but this was not where it ended 
 she was fairly randy especially after a weekend at a <unk> and would <unk> how much she was having with her boyfriend and her <unk> while she knew i barely had time for my girl supporting us 
 knowing she had a draw full of sex toys i was ... mean 
 if any of you are familiar with a product called blairs hot sauce you 've got an idea of where im going 
 i used the one known as ultra death 
 putting a thin coating over her larger toys that she would brag about often 
 this stuff was pretty potent 
 needless to say she was going to be in for a shock next time it was happy time 
 i wish i could say this was where the story ended 
 cc tried to get revenge 2 months later by sending pics of a pregnant belly to my girl with personal information as if i had cheated and knocked someone up 
 fortunately my girl saw through it immediately 
 so in return my girl who worked for major utility company got cc 's power cut at her new address and kept it disabled for 2 weeks caught up in red tape that all seemed totally legitimate 
 **tl : dr crazy housemate fucks with myself and my girl and lives in a disgusting fashion gets her evicted sex toys coated in hot chilli for that extra warming <unk> and power cut for 2 <unk> edit : tired of the constant messages claiming <unk> and <unk> 
 if your so certain its false read the comments that bad up the facts you might think you can see through 
 im not going to write every single detail 
 it would get in the way of telling a straight forward story 
 when my father was in the army he lived in <unk> government barracks sort of like apartments 
 one of the guys in his building would make a ton of racket every morning very early with his motorcycle 
 he would <unk> it loudly for a solid 10 minutes before leaving 
 he had been asked by others not to do this but he ignored them all 
 so one night my dad got out there with some wire <unk> and clipped every electrical wire on that motorcycle that he could find at both ends removing the cables he clipped out as he went along 
 the bike looked fine but naturally all exposed wiring was missing 
 he never heard that guy revving his motorcycle again 
 he knows it was repaired but the guy finally got the <unk> had passive aggressive room mates when i was in my trades training in the military 
 they usually have a course room together 4 to a room so that they can study together help each other out and generally build some esprit de <unk> 
 our course was odd <unk> so there was only 3 on our course in the room and 1 guy from my trade in our room but his course was just finishing 
 he was a good guy and i got along great with him 
 my room mates were passive aggressive douche bags who hated him 
 passive aggressive putting their bed space and furniture together with the tv and stereo on their side facing them so neither he nor i could see the tv or turn down the volume or even use the stereo when they were n't around <unk> everyone else sharing rooms shared their gear and equipment he and i were <unk> and the douches were n't 
 this guy smoked two packs a day to my one and that 's why they hated him 
 they whined and cried to our course mom <unk> in charge of anything we needed as to admin or leave requests etc 
 and he was removed 
 got a new room mate a guy i was friends with that went through basic with me 
 he did n't believe the shit i told him about these two until he moved in and saw how they had arranged the room 
 again they hated him because he told them to shut the fuck up when they cried at him about coming in late from a night exercise and waking them by mistake 
 i could n't tell them off since they were in my class but he could and he never took their shit 
 again to the course mom and boom he is gone 
 now it is just the three of us 
 they focused their crap on me and i just let it slide 
 i would go to sleep and they would turn on the tv loud i would be studying and they would crank the stereo to 80 's pop rock which i hated 
 they would accidentally '' spill stuff on my clean uniform while i was out so i would have to <unk> it an hour before inspection 
 they finally pissed me off when the <unk> the act of <unk> the black polish off the leather so it is raw brown leather my parade boots that i had spent over 100 hours polishing for the <unk> anniversary parade 
 again they claimed it was an accident 
 they both went to one of their parents places over a long weekend and i went to work 
 never fuck with the top of your class in an electronics trade 
 i took their stereo amp and tv to the <unk> <unk> radar systems lab and <unk> the power amps on the volume and power amp for the stereo amp and tv 
 from 95 db down to 30 db 
 then i sealed it all up and returned them to the room 
 since all of my course was from the same province as my base was located in they were all gone and no one saw me take or return the stuff to the barracks 
 when they returned they could n't figure out what was wrong since the factory <unk> were in place and the stuff was in the exact same position when they left 
 at the same time i had bought a ghetto boom box with a capital <unk> that pumped out a booming <unk> and started playing pink <unk> as loud as it would go followed up with deep purple all of which they called druggie music '' 
 this went on for 4 weeks 
 afterwards the course mom calls me into his office to let me know that they complained again since the were <unk> and i smoked that they wanted me moved 
 i was pissed but before i could get mad the course mom said they are only allowed 3 room mate moves so whoever they get for a room mate they are now stuck with for the next 4 months '' 
 then he winked at me 
 i was <unk> as to what the <unk> meant 
 after class i went up to my old room to move my stuff to my new room 
 grabbed my stuff and went down to my new room walked in and there were my two old room mates 
 damn was i glad to see they were my new roomies 
 as i finished moving in i went to grab the last of my stuff and the douches new roomies were moving in 
 2 french canadian guys who smoked 3 packs a day each 
 i laughed for a day 
 thanks course mom 
 near the end of my stay there the base had a <unk> of guys in my trade in different courses and whenever enough of them get together they always have epic parties 
 my <unk> who finished his trades training made me first promise not to tell they guys on my course about the party then he gave me the date and time 
 my course had heard about the party but they did n't know where it was going to be 
 i told them it was at a bar in town <unk> 's from the base starting at <unk> hrs but it was at the junior ranks bar on the far side of the base starting at <unk> 
 best party ever 
 the next monday they all knew they went to the wrong place and i told them it was a great party that they were n't wanted at 
 best revenge ever 
 even the guys in their own trade wanted nothing to do with them 
 p.s 
 douche took his stereo amp and tv in for repairs but his warranty was voided because the set had been repaired '' by a <unk> <unk> 
 to this day so many years later i wonder if they ever figured it out 
 tl dr : careful who you fuck with and careful how much you <unk> ago when i was just starting out in the world i got a job as a <unk> at a medium sized machine rental shop in northern <unk> 
 this was my very first real job and i put up with a lot of shit because it was 24 $ an hour for zero experience and zero training 
 the main source of my <unk> came from a man we will call ass-hat 
 ah was a nepotism hire he married into the company owner 's family and was given a job to shut his wife up or something 
 ah took verbally abusing me calling me stupid threatening to fire me ... etc virtually every chance he got 
 i was getting fed up and close to my breaking point when an <unk> chance for revenge presented it 's self 
 in that area of northern <unk> we had a problem with huge crows picking through garbage for food these birds are massive and <unk> 
 early one morning i was taking out the office trash and i noticed parked close the dumpster was ah 's brand new penis compensation ford 350 with a lift and a few thousand $ worth of chrome 
 <unk> the dumpster i proceeded to ah 's truck and with a <unk> i threw 3 bags full of refuse into his box 
 within minutes a <unk> swarm developed around their new found meal 
 the crows <unk> themselves on the trash and once <unk> decided to use this month old vehicle as a <unk> toilet 
 fly my <unk> fly 
 <unk> 
 all this happened at 9 am and ah did not leave the shop until close the 10 hours late that 's 10 hours worth of <unk> shit to clean off 
 as much as i was suspected it never came back to bite me and i eventually quit to go back to school 
 tldr - i <unk> a murder of crows to <unk> on a brand new pick up truck 
 edit- it should read let slip the crows of war - thanks <unk> for the <unk> 'm not sure of this is pro enough for this sub but here goes 
 i live with about 11 people 
 my family of four my aunt her husband and three kids 
 my other aunt and my grandma 
 it was a full house so to say 
 a couple years ago my mom was doing my hair along with my best friends hair for a party we had later on that evening 
 my uncle who 's like a father to me storms down the stairs to where i was and starts berating me in our native language 
 he 's speaking so fast i can barely understand what he 's saying 
 after a few minutes of just sitting there shell shocked i 've figured it out 
 the cable bill came in and there were three charges for adult movies 
 he automatically thought it was me me being the eldest in the house 
 my parents are called and i 'm being <unk> by all of them 
 i 'm instantly grounded with a promise of a <unk> later on 
 i did get to go to the party though only because my friend was meant to sleep over after the party 
 this happened on a friday 
 the next week was stressful and a living hell 
 i was n't allowed to hang with friends and whatnot but i was allowed to stay after school till the late bus <unk> us up 
 that was my cool down time my relaxing time 
 that got taken away 
 my parents are ultra conservative and can sometimes be mean <unk> 
 my mother would n't speak to me my uncle was still angry and ask the kids stayed away from me cause at this point i was collateral damage 
 i do n't blame them 
 my family can be scary 
 the only person i had on my side was my aunt the one with the husband and kids 
 she said she believed me when i said it was n't me 
 tbh i do watch porn 
 however i 'm not dumb enough to order it on demand not once not twice but three <unk> times 
 not bragging but i 'm much too smart for that 
 hearing her say she was on my side <unk> me into action 
 i called the cable company and asked them if it was possible to see which cable box a movie was ordered from 
 they told me yes that i would need to get the serial numbers of the cable boxes seeing as how they could only confirm or deny if that box was the culprit 
 took me a full weekend to this 
 the bedrooms were hardly ever empty so i had to be quick and <unk> 
 after i got all of the numbers i called the company back and lo and behold the videos were n't ordered from my cable box but rather the one in the room right across from mine 
 my younger cousin almost a brother had let me take all of the blame for his bullshit 
 he 'd even come up yo me and told me <unk> was gon na be okay '' 
 bull fucking shit 
 okay for him maybe 
 i was fucking livid at that point 
 i wanted to go down there and beat him to a <unk> 
 but i did n't 
 the weekend was a day away 
 the whole family would be there 
 if wait till then 
 i was home half an hour earlier than him 
 i was seated when he opened up the front door 
 he smiled and greeted me and the smile i gave him back must have told him that the gig was up 
 he was busted 
 i told him that i knew but i was n't gon na tell the parents 
 he was 
 he had till sunday night 
 <unk> back tears he told me that he was sorry and that he would confess 
 i waited and waited 
 nothing 
 saturday passed by and not a word was spoken 
 i did hear his parents ask him of he was alright he did look a little ill. sunday was the same thing 
 i waited and waited but the poor <unk> refused to say a word 
 i confronted him and told him his time was up 
 he begged me to tell them instead but i wanted to punish him 
 he made his bed and by gods was i going to help tuck him in 
 he still refused to say anything so i called down my mother told her that he has something to tell her 
 you see my mother was the most feared adult in the house 
 she comes down looking confused but willing to listen 
 i tell her that he 's got something very important to tell her and i walk away 
 i go into the other room and 45 seconds later i hear a very shocked and angry what 
 part of me feels bad but not that much 
 my mother is angry she 's shocked and she 's embarrassed 
 you see a <unk> before i found out who the culprit was we had gotten in an argument her my uncle and i. the two of them had been pestering and nagging at me to confess 
 fed up i asked my uncle why not ask your son too 
 you 're breathing down my back accusing me of something i did n't do yet you have n't asked any of your kids any questions '' 
 that earned me a few choice of words that would make a whore working the corners <unk> 
 that 's the day i started losing respect for him 
 anyway back to the moment of truth 
 uncle comes <unk> into the living room looking at me with a <unk> smile on his face thinking that i had finally caved and was ready to confess 
 and boy was he wrong 
 i 've never seen a black man go so red so fast 
 he was furious 
 all his anger and embarrassment was thrown at my cousin full force 
 i 'm the end my cousin got a spanking 
 and he was grounded 
 his teli was taken from him and to this day almost 5 <unk> layer he 's not allowed to watch teli 
 oh wait 
 do n't go 
 there 's more 
 fast forward to august 2014. the whole family is taking a trip to canada but my aunt is having some issues 
 she had recently lost my cousin 's <unk> papers so he ca n't travel any where until they get new ones 
 her two other kids do n't even have passports and she only had enough money for one of them 
 she was planning on taking my little cousin jane and leaving the two boys james cousin of this story and jake middle child at home with the <unk> 
 although i really ca n't afford it i offer to pay jake 's passport 
 why 
 so james can stay home all alone with grandma 
 the whole family will be on vacation except that little <unk> 
 revenge is like good pizza 
 great while its served hot but still oh so good the next day even when cold 
 <unk> 
 *edit* there are a few things i 'd like to clear up 
 some of you think my family is abusive but they are not 
 and no i do n't suffer from any kind of <unk> syndrome 
 we may not seem normal to you and why should we 
 we come from a country where it is n't illegal to beat your child as an act of discipline 
 they even sell <unk> just for that 
 but i can assure you that my family has never hit us without cause and even then at least for my mother her hits are louder than they are <unk> 's more for show than anything else really 
 this is the norm from where i come from 
 however my parents have changed once seeing how things are done here 
 now if there is a problem it 's talked yelled 
 out phones are taken away and such 
 i have n't been hit in years and nor has my cousin 
 i do n't know many abusive parents that can admit when they 're wrong and try changing their ways 
 also as for my cousin the number one reason he does n't have a teli in his bedroom is because his room is in the basement 
 his room was moved down there not as a punishment but because we renovated and added two new bedrooms down there so he could be somewhat more comfortable 
 where his room the tv can get flooded 
 so he watches tv in the family room or mine 
 he did something shitty faced the consequences and that 's it 
 i have a really good friend who used to work on a resort island off the east coast of australia 
 it was a fantastic lifestyle and he really had a great time 
 after about 2 years of happily partying and <unk> tourists and having an exceptional time of it things started to go downhill in the form of a bully 
 he had two mates and they were picking on my friend and taunting him 
 the <unk> was a huge <unk> native new <unk> guy and there was no way he could stand up to them without getting bashed 
 so ... they do n't realize he is a pro in revenge oh the stories i can tell and he sets his mind to getting his own back 
 on a friday night when the island club is really starting to kick and everyone is there he heads for the kitchen 
 armed with a commercial size <unk> of fish sauce he then heads back for the head bullies room 
 he poured it over everything 
 in his bed over all of his clothes in his luggage in his shoes into his shampoo and closed it again ... everything 
 it kind of dawned on him that he 'd better start packing now otherwise he 's going to get bashed really badly 
 but the only problem is he 's on an island 
 there is one ferry a day that goes back to the mainland in the morning 
 he went and packed his bags and had a brilliant idea ... shave time 
 no more beard nor <unk> no more long hair 
 1/2 an hour later he 's off and hiding in the bush waiting for the ferry to come 
 8 hours later or so the ferry starts boarding and he walks down the <unk> towards it 
 and there stood just at the <unk> is the 2 followers making sure he does n't leave 
 one of them points to him and says is n't that him '' 
 to which the other replies no he 's got long hair and a beard '' ... he walked <unk> passed them and got on the ferry 
 great success 
 more of the same guy here <unk> worked security for two years with a company and before that i had worked a year at another security company so i can say with confidence the general attitude is that we 're in this together being contractors so security officers stick together 
 maybe not a thin blue tan 
 line like police but we definitely looked after each other 
 one coworker at a site i stayed at for about a year was n't like that though 
 she straight up told everybody that her job was to man the computer and interact with the people coming and going from the guard <unk> 
 she did n't even do those two tasks particularly well since there were numerous complaints about her attitude with guests and another coworker who turned into a good friend of mine was always having to correct her work 
 she refused to make small talk as well which might have suited the customer 's security guy fine but kinda <unk> with us other guards 
 our site supervisors had to twist her arm to get her to accept overtime or even go out on <unk> and any time there was a <unk> she was on her phone <unk> breaking the rules in front of the cameras 
 she had even <unk> but i would n't put it past her admitted to my friend that if she ever had the chance to screw someone else to make herself look good she would 
 calling her a cunt would be an insult to female reproductive organs as she lacked the warmth and depth 
 she was in good with the upper management of our company however so she got away with being a really shitty desk clerk 
 one of our myriad duties as security officers at that site was to ensure a <unk> of keys were properly controlled and accounted for 
 this mostly meant making sure people signed them out properly and filling out a spreadsheet at the start of each shift 
 well one evening i 'm pulling a 12 hour shift so i 'm there in the middle of second shift which my friend worked the desk 
 for whatever reason he was going through the key box when lo and behold a key was missing 
 looking through the log there was n't a concrete entry for it but we had suspicion on one entry early in first shift so it likely had been out since that morning 
 well coworker one stays till an hour into second shift so she generally got a few reports done before she left 
 as it turned out she had listed said key as being in the key box when she checked 
 once this was realized both coworker 2 and i had shit-eating <unk> cat grins on our faces 
 of course we had to make it look official so since i was going to be taking over the desk when coworker 2 left it would be down to me 
 i 'm not much of an actor but i really nailed the surprised concern with my third shift partner as i discovered the key was missing checked the logs and then checked coworker 1 's sheet 
 of course a missing key required an incident report and i did not hold back 
 i attached a copy of the log sheet and the key report which had coworker 1 's <unk> and the time she filled out the report 
 i also had to inform first shift about the report in turnover but fortunately coworker 1 came in an hour after first shift started 
 that incident report was the last straw and last i heard about it they were going to replace coworker 1 but i left that post about two months later and was fired just last week for unrelated reasons 
 i think i earned the slight fear of a few of the other guards thanks to that 
 and to head off such comments : i 'm not a blue <unk> 
 were it anyone else i would have let the client contact do the <unk> on investigating and i 'm sure it would have called for a reprimand but since she had a history of screwing up paperwork i think it was just the final nail in the coffin 
 i also am not normally that vicious but by that point i was fucking done with that site for several other reasons so that was me getting some anger out 
 but boy did it feel <unk> story is n't for the karma or any of that bullshit 
 this is a throwaway account because i do n't need my girlfriend among other people learning about this story as it relates to my involvement in it 
 so i play in a band and hang out with a lot of other guys in bands 
 if you listen to van <unk> tour kind of music there 's a chance you may be familiar with our work 
 here is the thing about bands : they share woman very <unk> 
 once a girl starts dating a guy in a band she 's off limits 
 do n't touch her 
 it creates drama not only between the two guys but between the two bands as well 
 record labels and managers especially hate that drama so it 's in <unk> best interest to never ever cheat with a girl dating a guy in another band 
 it 's an <unk> but well-known fact 
 another well known fact is that once a girl is single regardless of who she has dated in the past she is fair game 
 guys do n't usually raise a huge fuss when their ex bangs another guy from another band ... it 's almost expected 
 in hockey you have <unk> '' in bands you have <unk> '' 
 it is what it is 
 so i get a call from a girl call her <unk> she was engaged to the singer of a band who you may be familiar with as they have found commercial success 
 j calls me up and says lets get together tonight '' 
 now i know what this means 
 long and short of it is that we hung out smoked a bit and had some beers and hooked up 
 now she was not wearing an engagement ring and she claimed she and her ex were completely done 
 i was out on tour so i had no idea of their status ... and she led me to believe that it had been this way for a while 
 once i found out she lied i took charge and wanted to let the guy know i just hooked up with his ex '' current 
 fiance 
 i felt terrible and knew it needed to be done 
 here 's where the drama starts 
 she denies <unk> 
 she claims it never happened and that i am a total liar 
 now this band bitch has some pull 
 she knows people all over the industry and because she was so pissed that i tried to fuck her over tell the truth 
 she started a campaign against me 
 her fiance and her told everyone i was making shit up and trying to get attention from other bands 
 in reality i was just trying to do what i <unk> as the right thing 
 now this went on for months 
 and months 
 and months 
 i would get calls in the middle of the night where one of them would call me or both at the same time for real bitching me out 
 i lost a lot of good friends who sided '' with them and wanted nothing to do with me 
 fast forward another few months 
 they break up for real 
 like for real 
 she ends up hitting me up again total band bitch and asks to hang out 
 we end up fucking and she thinks the whole past year or so is just the funniest thing 
 after getting her pretty stoned i pull out my phone and i start taking photos of her these will not be shared fellas 
 i got photos of her from behind while fucking from on top from everywhere 
 she was so into being <unk> that she started taking photos of herself getting real dirty 
 month or so later we get a call and would n't you know it we 're scheduled by our label to meet up and play six shows together with this band the one who the singer was with j 
 now originally i was thinking about maybe just texting these photos to the guy and being like yo fuck you '' ... but it was n't enough 
 so i 'm pondering what the hell to do in my mind and nothing seems to click until i realized something 
 this band did a song where their backdrop '' was a bunch of photos and shit 
 i do n't want to go into detail other than that however the program that ran the backdrop was controlled by their <unk> on side stage right 
 it was a simple program that ran the photos ... it was matched to a click track so they changed with the beat of the song 
 on our last night with this band we 're on the east coast 
 a fellow <unk> of mine and myself figured out what program the tech used what the click rate '' was on the track and after 5 nights of watching how it was all set up really easy ... just plug your computer in and the images project on a huge ass screen behind the drummer 
 when it was time for them to play the song that uses the photos we waited until they started 
 after 10 seconds or so of them playing to the normal backdrop my <unk> tech called theres away and i plugged my mac in instead of his 
 i waited for the beat to hit and i clicked the <unk> 
 with the beat of the music pictures of j <unk> my dick <unk> herself and dancing around my house naked were displayed behind the band 
 they went 20 - 30 seconds before the band noticed another 2 minutes before it stopped 
 the mother fuckers kept playing and best of all the singer stood there in front of a <unk> crowd who loved it forcing him to act like it was part of the show '' 
 he was pissed 
 you could n't tell it was me in the photos but it was my mac plugged in and because of my history with his ex he figured it out pretty quickly 
 i got jumped that night by him and two dudes when i was smoking a cig out back 
 punched in the face 4 or 5 times and kicked pretty hard in the ribs once or twice 
 i felt like it was pretty fair i did n't fight back or retaliate 
 just laughed my ass off while getting fucked up 
 worth every bruise and the black eye 
 <unk> agarkov received a credit card offer in the mail from tinkoff credit systems 
 after reading the fine print he found that he disagreed with much of their terms so he <unk> an identical copy of the application but his terms stipulated 0 % interest no fees and no credit limit 
 he also included clauses <unk> tinkoff for any modifications or <unk> of the contract 
 he sent in the application and the company sent him a card <unk> approving it and accepting agarkov 's <unk> terms 
 two years later tinkoff sued agarkov for failure to pay fees and interest 
 the judge ruled in agarkov 's favor ruling that he only pay the balance remaining on the card ~ $ 500 usd 
 he has since <unk> for approximately $ <unk> usd citing his various clauses for penalties associated with breaking the contract 
 a ruling has not yet been issued for his <unk> 
 source : so i was told to post this here and after coming here and reading i have a new favorite sub 
 was dating this girl for awhile things were going very very well 
 or so i thought i found out that she had cheated on me 
 i 'll skip a bunch of stuff but we ended up working it out 
 i should have walked away yes i know 
 but then i would n't have this funny to tell you 
 so everything goes back to normal i was working roughly 12-18 hour days trying to get my business started 
 she was going to college at the time 
 so there was n't a lot of time that we got to spend together but when we did it was amazing 
 loved her feeling was mutual blah blah blah 
 well about 6 months after we got back together my friend sends me a pic it 's my so and a guy that he lives with 
 she 's <unk> <unk> him on the couch the roommate not my friend 
 so of course i was highly pissed 
 was paying for this girls education a place for her to live etc 
 so i decided that i was leaving 
 well ended up texting her and saying that i was going out of town for a couple of days knowing that would make her not come back to the house for awhile 
 i decided in a drunken stupor to get revenge 
 not by burning her clothes trashing her name or making her life hell 
 but by <unk> her <unk> in <unk> juice 
 i left got the usual wtf messages 
 i did n't even bother responding to them 
 then about a week later i got the mother of all texts 
 it was glorious if i still had the transcript i would post them here 
 but there 's my story 
 hope you enjoyed <unk> so my now ex girlfriend was letting some of her homeless friends stay with us for cheap rent 
 i woke up one day and my phone was gone 
 the odd part was i left it in between both my <unk> and those were there 
 i immediately thought it was them but nobody would believe me 
 you probably just do n't know where you left it '' 
 so i bring up find my iphone on the computer and it shows nothing 
 i leave it up just in case 
 i should also mention <unk> and <unk> are gone they said they were going to the mall last night 
 so we 're all looking around and stuff and lo and behold guess what shows up on my map 
 my phone is magically at the mall 
 now she believed me 
 so we called them and they said it must have been a break in but they would look for it 
 i also called all the phone shops and mall security in case they tried to sell it 
 i get a call back later they said they found it 
 some asshole had it and they beat him up for it 
 wow that 's literally unbelievable 
 so i tell him that 's good when i get the phone i 'll be able to plug it in and see who it was that was looking at the phone when it was turned on thanks to a security app that does n't actually exist 
 oh you might see pictures of me doing funny shit in the camera ... haha <unk> '' so they get home and those bastards stole my sim card 
 luckily it 's a <unk> iphone <unk> so it is n't really needed 
 they also tried to reset it but it just ended up being <unk> locked 
 i thank them profusely and just leave the phone on my desk to let them stew 
 they look nervous as fuck so i drag it out a bit talking about how i do n't really feel like checking who it was tonight 
 the next morning i kick them out and do n't give them a refund on that months rent 
 they went off on us saying how they helped us and we were horrible people ect ... throwing a fit and denying it screaming and talking about how they were going to break shit 
 enjoy being homeless cunts 
 they are still living on the street 
 i still see them sitting on the street from time to time while doing errands 
 my buddies and i rented a house <unk> college 
 big place 6 of us living there with two dogs and a fat <unk> cat mine 
 still with me still fat 
 next door lived a gentleman who i shall call meathead 
 meathead worked out a lot and was constantly <unk> and rude 
 we always thought <unk> but thats just guessing 
 3 of my room mates were in a band and would practice in the garage 
 garage was covered in foam and was not that loud 
 meathead called the cops twice and was told we were not doing anything wrong 
 later on we had a huge party at our house 
 we got permits from the city and had the band play 
 meathead called the cops again and we had to stop everything and sort it out for a half hour 
 as the cops are leaving meathead who has been watching from the sidewalk starts yelling search the house for drugs 
 the 're a bunch of <unk> '' 
 we were not we were stoners cops leave band plays party goes on 
 a few week later my buddy and i get home one night and find the garage door busted in and the band equipment fucked up 
 drums slashed and power <unk> <unk> 
 the speaker covers were dented but undamaged 
 we figured kicked 
 we call the cops and report it 
 we are all kinda scared of meathead so we do n't say anything 
 but the cops know all about us and go over to talk with him 
 do n't know what happened but meathead goes away in cuffs 
 the police report never mentioned him and as far as we know it is still <unk> 
 cops would n't tell us what was up just to stay out of his way 
 the band knows their way around second hand music so wires get <unk> and drums are fixed 
 ended up being $ <unk> 
 when we next see <unk> 4 of us are in the front yard 
 he says how 's your band sounding '' real smug 
 until now we have all gotten together and said we should not push this guy 's buttons 
 but the drummer shoots back with great 
 how your asshole feel '' 
 meathead loses it and attacks him 
 we do n't make a good show of ourselves kicks all our asses 
 but the cops come after he leaves and he is arrested again 
 we press charges and get a restraining order against him 
 now remember the dogs 
 2 a little <unk> and a <unk> dog with 3 legs 
 they were a <unk> pair so they were inside most times 
 walks and the dog park and <unk> twice a day for nature 
 about a month after the fight my buddy takes the dogs out back then brings them both inside and tells me to come outside 
 i go and there are bits of meat all over like steak strips 
 wrapped in most are chocolate and we found unknown pills in some 
 most of them are towards <unk> house 
 dogs are never let out back again 
 drummer loses it both dogs are his 
 but any thing happens and meathead is going to think it 's us we do n't want to test the restraining order that much 
 we wait 2 months till the other 4 roomies are going out of town for a week : 3 to a wedding back east and 1 on work 
 drummer and i make a plan to go up to napa for 4 days and make a big fuss about asking the other neighbors on the street to watch the place 
 we rent a hotel room and everything 
 2 nights in we have a buddy who lives in the area stay in the hotel room with his girl and tell him to order some movies 
 we drive back 
 meathead has a truck that he loves tricked out 4 wheel drive with chrome and a custom paint job 
 when we get there around midnight and the truck was n't there 
 we eat at <unk> 's and the truck still is n't there at 1. a blunt later and at 2 am the truck is there 
 we <unk> off as much gas as we can and fill it with <unk> 
 toothpaste is rubbed on that tailgate art 
 drive back up to napa about 6 hours all told and tell our buddy to get some clothes on we want to get some sleep 
 when we got back the truck was n't in the drive way and we never saw it again 
 meathead moved out maybe 6 months later 
 we never told the others about it until he was gone and in our group 's <unk> the amount of shit we did get bigger everytime : tl dr : dude smashes our stuff attacks us and try to kill our dogs 
 we ruin his <unk> high school jack and stefan hated each other 
 one day stefan took it too far and got jack in a lot of trouble with the school which had repercussions at home with his personal life etc. so jack hatched a plan 
 he knew stefan had a sweet tooth 
 he knew stefan liked to gloat and brag 
 he knew stefan did n't like to share 
 jack went to a chemist and bought the largest available bar of laxative chocolate available 
 keep in mind that we were children so it was a lot of money at the time 
 jack then bought a bar of cadbury chocolate very carefully pulled apart the wrapping put in the laxative chocolate and <unk> it 
 at school the next day in our weekly extended lunchtime registration where we did all school announcements group activities that bullshit jack gifted stefan with a big bar of cadbury chocolate as a peace offering saying he hoped it would patch things up between them 
 stefan snatched the chocolate and paraded it around the room opened it up told everyone they could n't have a piece and ate this huge amount of chocolate in under a minute 
 to date it 's the fastest i 've seen someone eat 
 i should mention that the recommended <unk> was four squares 
 he easily ate sixty 
 stefan ran out of the room and we did n't see him for three days 
 edit : as <unk> pointed out it may not be common knowledge that this is fucking <unk> moved into an apartment in the first floor of a complex 
 my next-door neighbor owned a large bird looked to be over 18 '' that made loud noises most of the day and often throughout the night 
 my roommate and i approached the neighbor bird owner or bo a few times over the course of 6 months asking him to please keep his bird quiet 
 bo said he would the first few times but then would just tell us to mind our own fucking business '' after that 
 we would speak with other tenants in the building as we would see them in the <unk> and in the parking lot and they had issues with bo for the <unk> bird squawking too 
 i called the management office to file a complaint and they said they would need to investigate - which they eventually did 
 unfortunately the bird was quiet when the <unk> came out and nobody in bo 's apartment answered the door 
 so nothing came of it 
 the squawking continued day and night and i recorded some of it and played it to the management office while filing another complaint 
 they said there was no way to prove that the recording i played was from bo and that they needed to witness the noise <unk> first hand 
 traditional channels were not working so i decided to try something different 
 i looked up what type of bird this was and found recordings online of the different sounds they made 
 i located the sound that meant warning 
 <unk> in the area 
 hide and be silent '' 
 i put the speakers from my home audio system against the wall that was adjacent to bo 's apartment and every time that damn bird began to squawk i would play the warning '' 
 bird call at full volume 
 the bird would shut up for <unk> minutes 
 this went on for a while but it was by no means a perfect solution as the bird would still squawk at random times and wake me up at night 
 i ran into some of my other neighbors and we got to talking again about the annoying bird 
 they told me that the bird was getting louder and completely out of hand 
 i realized that they were not only complaining about the bird 's actual noises but the warning '' recordings i was playing 
 this gave me an idea 
 i searched for more recordings made by this particular breed of bird and began playing them loudly to see how the bird would react 
 there was one specific sound that <unk> rage in the bird and it would go nuts for 30 minutes or more 
 i began playing this sound randomly throughout the day at times i knew bo was home - the bird would go crazy and squawk loudly every time and bo could do nothing to stop it 
 i heard bo yelling at the bird banging on the bird 's cage and then other people yelling at each other from that apartment 
 this was amazing 
 i could ruin their day 
 so i started playing the rage sound a few times every night and the bird would go insane 
 i heard people yelling items being thrown and over all of it the bird completely losing its shit 
 after a few days of doing this it sort of lost its <unk> so i called the management team and filed another complaint stating that the bird was making the noise right now and that they needed to send someone to investigate 
 the person on the phone said that they were already planning on sending someone due to the large number of complaints they had received over the past few days and that they would be out within 10 minutes 
 i got off the phone and played the <unk> bird call - the crazy bird reacted just like before and went nuts 
 the investigator showed up soon after the bird still screaming and they had their evidence 
 a week later bo was gone and so was that bird 
 the vacated apartment was left destroyed 
 the apartment management had crews in and out of that place for weeks ripping out <unk> and flooring replacing damaged <unk> appliances and fixtures 
 they had kept the bird in the bathroom in and out of a large cage and everything was covered in bird shit 
 what i learned : a bird in the bathtub is worth two fists in your goddamn <unk> the tender age of 19 i married my high school sweetheart who had just turned 18. she literally had just turned 18 and i was proud to have a ring on my finger and be able to call her my wife 
 we have been married for almost a year now and while it is not <unk> bliss we are still enjoying life to the fullest 
 she is wonderful to me in every way and i can not imagine life without my wife 
 whats even more enjoyable is her extended family 
 i come from a very small family 
 my father an adopted child never really knew his real parents but grew up well nonetheless 
 my mother too lived in a sort of broken home and both of my parents had to grow up almost dirt poor 
 as you can imagine living dirt poor has had an effect on me as well 
 as small as my family is my <unk> make up even more of my family with my wife having a larger family then mine could ever have 
 i am giving you this small history lesson for a reason 
 you see my wife has a great-grandmother that is one of the sweetest ladies in existence 
 she is kind beautiful funny and been through so much i regard her with great wisdom and love 
 the woman has lived through generations of technology grew up in the great depression and has seen almost every major war this country has been <unk> in 
 marrying young to a carpenter they grew their family as much as they could sewing love and a hard work ethic into their kids at a very young age 
 her husband was the kind of guy that hated hospitals and did n't need the <unk> things in life 
 he once put a nail through his hand cursed out loud pulled the nail out and sealed the wound with <unk> glue 
 he was a man 's man in every sense of the word 
 he passed in 2012 and you can imagine that she is now very lonely and heartbroken without him 
 now that you know a little about this woman you can imagine my shock and complete rage when i found out someone had smashed my <unk> 's is that the right word 
 <unk> mailbox 
 it had been <unk> by her husband and was something she loved so much because he made it before he passed 
 apparently she found it smashed right outside her house and she cried for hours 
 several young teenagers grew up on the road where g-gma lived so i had my idea on who broke the mailbox in the first place 
 so i did what anyone would of done and cooked up a plan for revenge 
 i built my g-gma another wooden mailbox and made it out of a very <unk> and thin wood 
 i am not a carpenter by any means and it was an incredibly ugly mailbox 
 i placed it outside and waited for the fools to destroy it 
 sure enough it was found in literal pieces the next day right around <unk> <unk> 
 so i built another one out of the same material and placed it outside just like before 
 i needed to make sure exactly when the fools came by 
 for this i waited at her house for the exact time 
 at 4:00pm a screaming and hollering alerted me to the front of the house where several idiots driving a large red truck came flying down the road 
 they drove past the mailbox and boom it shattered into a billion pieces as one of the idiots smashed it with a steel bat 
 they yelled in <unk> and i had guessed that the destruction of my mailboxes had become routine as it shattered very easily from the bat 
 now understanding what time they came around i built another mailbox and made it easily <unk> 
 it was ugly in every way and i made it even more <unk> then the first two 
 i installed it like normal and the next day waited for the <unk> to drop off the mail 
 i realized how ugly it was when the <unk> gave it a concerned look as if he were afraid if he reached into it he would gain thousands of <unk> and maybe aids 
 picking up the mail i promptly replaced the mail inside with a large cement cinder block 
 it barely fit inside the mailbox but it was concealed quite nicely 
 i knew that at the speed they usually went and the bat they used this could serious screw up whoever was <unk> the mailbox but at the time i did not care in the slightest 
 sure enough that day they came around at 4:00pm 
 flying down the road the bumbling idiots screamed as their <unk> got ready 
 <unk> 
 a scream echoed out across town and the truck sped off quicker then usual 
 i have no idea what kind of damage was done but you better believe that was the last time someone bothered destroying my g-gma 's mailbox 
 if you enjoyed this story please read my blog for more stories from my life 
 i also must thank you <unk> for your great stories of revenge 
 i had to put this up for all to see 
 my <unk> link is i go to the movies with my so and its her choice 
 ends up being hunger games 
 oh well im 35 and i can can handle a chick flick for a bit 
 theater is packed 
 few <unk> in i nicely ask the 4 young teenage girls to keep their voices down 
 over the the next half hour i know everything about their simple teen lives because they wont shut up 
 phones on the whole time 
 i get a little more firm and then angry with them 
 then a plan comes together 
 i had a huge soda in my hand and carefully <unk> a hole in the bottom with a key and plug it with my finger 
 say to my so were out of here 
 i get up to leave then standing in the isle and i say sorry to the <unk> for getting angry with them and if the one on the end could hold my soda while i put on my jacket 
 girl takes my soda holding it over her lap we then speed walk as fast as i can to the exit im a few feet from the door and i hear the most <unk> horror movie scream man has ever heard 
 there was this shitty family in my neighborhood growing up called the simmons 
 i could go on for days about how awful they all are but this story is about the youngest one jessica 
 my brother craig best friend cici and i all played with her 
 this happened when we were all <unk> years old 
 jessica was a chubby spoiled little brat 
 she lied would throw fits if she did n't get her way and tried <unk> to play cici and i against each other 
 we were all getting sick of her and things came to a head one week when she thought it would be funny to push both cici and i into her <unk> 
 fed up with her lies her efforts to ruin our friendship and the fact that we both had to walk home soaking wet within days of each other cici and i decided we had had enough of jessica 
 so she my brother and i devised a plan 
 we filled up a bucket of water balloons and both my brother 's super <unk> 
 then we walked down the street and asked jessica to come play with us 
 we were all playing nicely in my backyard 
 i snuck off and grabbed the bucket of balloons and hit her in the back with one 
 before she could react cici ran over turned on the hose and attacked jessica with cold <unk> water while i continued my balloon assault 
 as jessica ran around the other side of the house sobbing with us the hose and the balloons hot on her heels we screamed now craig '' 
 and my brother jumped out super soaker in hands blocking her path and soaked whatever spots we had missed 
 after unloading and entire soaker onto her he picked up a second gun and chased her all the way down our driveway we lived on a hill 
 we laughed until my mom called us in for dinner 
 she had watched the whole thing 
 she did not stop us or even mention it 
 she told me years later that she never liked jessica 
 not my story but my friend 's an act of revenge he did back in the 90s with a scumbag landlord of his 
 he lived at this apartment in dallas for a while and his landlord was a real dick 
 he would complain about <unk> noises he jacked up the rent via some slimy <unk> in the contract he refused to make any repairs and left my friend to call <unk> etc 
 on his own 
 at lot more stuff that i ca n't remember 
 the final straw was when my friend announced he was moving out 
 he gave about two months notice but the landlord screamed bloody murder about this and that i do n't really know but bottom like he flat out announced that my friend would never get his security deposit back 
 my friend was prepared to fight this but then said fuck it a plan of revenge is worth a few hundred bucks 
 by lucky chance for this plan the move out was at the end of august -- the middle of summer 
 there was a closet in the apartment that he cleaned out completely 
 it was fairly large with <unk> floors like the rest of the apartment 
 then he went down to a <unk> 's shop and asked for the offal -- basically intestines and scrap -- they were going to throw away 
 he came back with a trash bag full of pig stomach intestines fat bones and god knows what else 
 he went back a few more times and got even more bags 
 he put all this offal in these big hefty bags and put them in the closet 
 he then closed the closet door and taped it all to hell -- it was <unk> sealed no air in or out 
 fast forward two months 
 it was time to go he was moving out he had all his stuff out all that was left to do was leave the keys on the counter and go 
 which he did 
 but the *very* last thing he did was put on some rubber gloves rubber boots and a <unk> and <unk> the closet door 
 working as quickly as he could all within a few large <unk> he took a knife and cut cut cut all those hefty bags with the two month old offal <unk> in there 
 he said even holding his breath and breathing through his mouth the stench was unbelievable 
 he dumped the contents on the floor closed the closet door and walked out 
 he never heard back from the landlord again 
 not technically an update since grandpa has been gone over 20 years now but my grandma passed away recently and while cleaning out her house i found the newspaper clipping about the phony bomb and wanted to share it 
 clipping here original post here this story happened sometime between 2nd and 4th grade so forgive a lack of details 
 the revenge was also a bit of happy coincidence so it does n't involve the plotting <unk> of the best posts on this sub but it was one of my more satisfying revenges nonetheless 
 growing up i lived in a suburb of the twin cities 
 there were a lot of kids in the neighborhood and one of them we 'll call him meany pants was a <unk> bully 
 no matter what the game was he 'd always cheat 
 if he ever did n't get his way he 'd hit the other kids until they cried and then he 'd lie and say other kids did it when we 'd tell our parents 
 he 'd always <unk> * steal people 's toys and then run away 
 looking back he came from that house '' in the neighborhood : lawn all fucked up christmas lights up all year never participated in the <unk> thing at christmas etc 
 i 'm sure the house was shitty because his parents were <unk> which is probably why he was such a <unk> but i digress 
 right across the street from my house there was an ice rink where kids could skate during the winter 
 it was summer at the time and we were all playing around climbing back and forth over the hockey rink fence thing 
 right as this girl was climbing over meany pants grabs her shoe and pushes up so she falls 
 she starts crying so my brother and i yell at meany pants and tell him that he ca n't play with us anymore because he 's a stinky head 
 this does n't sit well and meany pants picks up a big piece of glass and starts chasing me around with it telling me he 's going to stab me 
 i <unk> remember this incident and can honestly say it was my first experience with terror 
 i was seriously afraid this <unk> kid was going to stab me 
 meany pants was my age older than my brother so my brother in his infinite wisdom kept his distance and pelted meany pants with rocks until meany pants got sick of not catching me and getting hit with rocks and gave up 
 cut to winter time 
 my brother and i are at the ice rink <unk> 
 hoping we 've forgotten the attempted murder and will be willing to let him play with us meany pants comes up and asks what we 're doing 
 we tell him to go away because he 's mean 
 he says something along the lines of fine 
 i only came here to use the bathroom anyway '' 
 he goes into the port-o-potty they had set up for the <unk> and locks the door behind him 
 the port-o-potty is hard up against the berm where they put all the snow that they <unk> off of the parking lot of the park where the ice rink is so we run over plant our feet on the berm and push on the back of the port-o-potty as hard as we can 
 it tips over and we hear a scream <unk> by a splash 
 we run away and end up getting totally busted by our mom because we come in the house laughing hysterically and wo n't tell her why 
 she marched us back across the street to help her roll the port-o-potty so the door could open 
 when he <unk> out meany pants is <unk> covered in blue stuff and my brother and i ca n't even laugh because he just looks so miserable and pathetic 
 my mom 's yelling at us and telling us to apologize which we do 
 my mom walks meany pants home and when she comes back she 's even <unk> pissed because his parents read her the riot act 
 we got in <unk> much trouble 
 if i remember correctly we were completely grounded for a month 
 we did n't think about it as we were running away but it was explained to us loudly by my mother that we are idiots and this was actually a dangerous prank because if my mom had n't figured out what was going on meany pants would have froze to death 
 oops 
 **tl dr : my brother and i turn a little shit into a shithead 
 ** **edit : ** til that to read someone the riot act '' is an <unk> <unk> and should be <unk> was this indian guy who i shared an apartment with in college - we were all international students 
 he was so incredibly selfish lazy and annoying and had a ridiculously spoilt <unk> 
 he would borrow silverware from me without asking but instead of washing it up because he did n't know how he later admitted that he just threw it away 
 every time we planned to leave the apt 
 to buy groceries etc ... he would always delay 
 we would arrange to leave at say <unk> and he would not be ready until 2pm 
 one time he flipped out because i just left without him 
 he never helped with <unk> in the apartment 
 he <unk> to tell about his life back home where his family owned a large business 
 he would have <unk> at his home doing everything for him 
 then he told how his parents <unk> his high school teacher to tutor him they then bribed her to give him the answers to a test 
 she lost her job over it 
 but all he could do was joke about it and be all smug about how he was n't really punished by the school 
 he also once hit a homeless man with his car in the street and instead of stopping to help he drove to a police station to tell them 
 the guy died and as the country is so corrupt his family managed to <unk> their way out of jail 
 he would also say how he <unk> his way out of speeding tickets getting <unk> and a ton of other shit 
 meanwhile his academic work at college was suffering as he was too lazy to do any work 
 this was the first time he had <unk> outside of india 
 he had one group assignment where one guy did all his work because they did n't want a bad grade - as it was one grade for everyone 
 he then had one assignment where he found a online site and paid someone $ 300 to do the work for him - it was a really easy assignment - a <unk> paper on a business which had all the info he needed on their website worth 30 % of his grade 
 i could have done it and i 'm not even doing the same major 
 so after all the bullshit he put me through for the year we lived together and the fact he was such a spoilt asshole i decided to email his professor and tell him he cheated on the paper 
 his professor thanked me for telling him but said it might be difficult to prove 
 still they organised a meeting between him and the school 
 back at the apartment he told us about the meeting and asked me for advice on what to do - as i was a senior 
 i told him he should just admit it it was better to be honest now than to lie as it would <unk> it worse and they may not take it as seriously if you admit it early on - this was knowing full well the school 's policy was immediate expulsion for any form of <unk> 
 he went to the meeting admitted it and his professor emailed me to update me saying there would still be a drawn out process going to the president for approval getting all necessary people involved etc ... but that ultimately he would be expelled 
 he still stayed in college working his way through the process until he finally came to the <unk> it was all over 
 a year of his life wasted and thousands of dollars in tuition gone down the drain 
 he ended up telling his parents it was group project and another member of his team did the cheating and that it was gon na be a long drawn out investigation where he was n't sure he could prove his innocence 
 so he said he wanted to just cut his college experience short and come home - he did n't really need the degree anyway as he had a job lined up in the family business 
 so he stayed in college to the end of the semester just partying and ended up dropping out before he could be expelled 
 still feel bad his parents did n't know the truth and wasted all that money on his education 
 but at the end of the day i think he needed a lesson that he could n't pay his way through life - not sure it <unk> though 
 tl dr : terrible roommate and spoilt brat cheated on a college paper 
 i told his professor and got him <unk> my college days i had to work on a group project 
 i had no problem at first with the girl jane '' who was a born dictator 
 very pushy and took the control over the group and the project 
 it was n't a problem until any idea from the group was turned down by jane and we were just sitting and listening to her 
 we had roles in the presentation and everyone supposed to present as a one of the requirements in the assignment 
 of course every word in the presentation was jane 's work 
 all the group agreed that jane 's ideas suck that this assignment is a failure and no one believed we can get a good grade anyway 
 additionally jane seemed to take all the credit for the work done even if we put time to create it 
 during our last meeting i created a design of the product we were talking about uploaded it and send the link from <unk> '' to jane which was pointing to a picture on <unk> 
 i remember she did n't copy the picture to power point but she pasted the link instead 
 since she was the i know the best '' type of a person and i did n't care i just sat quite 
 the presentation looked very awful by the way - just text and bullet points 
 everyone in the group was pissed at jane a straight a student with <unk> tendencies 
 it was just horrible to work with her 
 since the project was only 5 % of the grade we all agreed without jane knowing to not come to the presentation day for the class as our revenge 
 just before the class started something occurred to me 
 i could redirect the link ... so i did 
 the picture which supposed to be under the link was the product in hands of a happy person some simple photoshop work 
 i redirect the link to this picture later other people from the class said that jane was freaking out we were n't there she was very nervous and said some stupid things 
 she had to present by herself as she was <unk> leader of the group 
 when she opened the link in the presentation everyone was cracking up because she said something about happy clients 
 jane did n't talk to us ever again she even removed all of us from the fb group she created 
 there was 30 points possible for the presentation 
 our group got 5 points 
 unfortunately i got <unk> in the class and if we 'd got at least 13 points which we would if we 'd showed up i would have a- 
 luckily jane got a- which if we 'd showed up would n't lower her grade and she 'd have an a. overall a good <unk> and everyone in the group agreed on that 
 *** tl dr^ a female <unk> gets punished by her group <unk> herself in front of all the class and gets lowered grade which is the end of the world for her 
 i was on the <unk> today and these two really bitchy girls and one asshole <unk> got on and sat down next to me 
 one girl looked over at my shoes and said thats the new generation of ugly '' 
 i was n't sure if she actually was talking about my shoes because she was talking to the other girl and so they talked about my shoes for about two minutes until they specifically mentioned the brand <unk> by name then i was positive they were talking about my shoes 
 the were not even trying to hide it 
 they kept bending over to look at my shoes 
 now i am not a vengeful person but then i realize that they are talking about bullying people 
 im not even joking i am pretty positive one said i bully her everyday its really fun '' 
 so i decide that i need to do something i realize that the girl sitting next to me was wearing white jeans and that i had a black pen in my pocket 
 i take the pen out and unscrew the top <unk> 
 i let the ink flow onto her <unk> and she does not noticed so i wait for my stop 
 when we get there i get up turn to them and say nice pants they match my shoes '' my shoes are black 
 she looked down and the look of <unk> and horror on her face was priceless but i 'm not done yet 
 as i walk out i shout <unk> '' and the guy gets up and runs at me in an attempt to punch me 
 but and i kid you not the train doors close so that he ends up punching the metal doors 
 he screams like a little girl 
 i wave sarcastically as the train moves on and i think one of the girls started crying but i felt really good 
 sorry for the long <unk> years back i began to receive the scam emails from nigeria 
 i 'm sure you are familiar with these so i wo n't go into a great explanation 
 normally i can just ignore them but these were coming to an email <unk> to a domain that i owned for my computer repair business 
 it started with a few and then grew to about 20 per day - every single day 
 it was irritating to get an email notification only to find out that it was one of these bs emails 
 i thought ... what to do what to do ... then i had an idea 
 i went to <unk> and created a free website with nothing more than a counter on it 
 i <unk> out to a command prompt and wrote a batch file that when executed erased <unk> <unk> <unk> then launched a browser which loaded the website i had created i put a pause in it silently <unk> the windows directory just to make sure their pc made it to the website then it would shut down the pc 
 for those of you not in the <unk> this will prevent a computer from <unk> stopping at a black screen <unk> an error message 
 a good tech could have it back up and going with not much issue but i was betting against that - after all this is nigeria 
 i packaged the file into a password protected zip file and emailed it back to a few scammers stating that <unk> was given to me by the bank and <unk> my banking and credit card information 
 it is set to give a false virus warning to stop scammers the password for the first file is & lt password & gt 
 please do not steal my information i trust you 
 within 2 days the counter on my website had went from 3 where i tested it to over <unk> i have yet to receive another email from scammers at this email address 
 from what i understand they <unk> each others email in hopes of stealing <unk> from each other 
 i hope that the <unk> i forced upon them was enough to allow for at least a few people to be educated about this scam 
 i do n't know i can call this revenge but it sure felt good 
 one day i 'm driving home 
 it 's about <unk> in the afternoon so there are a decent amount of people on the road 
 this particular street i 'm driving on is mostly two lanes but there 's a three block section where it <unk> to three lanes 
 as i 'm approaching this section i notice a large truck in the front spot in my current lane middle 
 the third lane is open so i change lanes to the right signaling 
 i pass the line of cars and aforementioned truck signal left and get over with two blocks to spare 
 as i 'm coming up to where these two lanes <unk> i see a kia <unk> flying up behind me in the now <unk> third lane 
 he passes me and cuts me off without using his <unk> puffing on a cigarette 
 i drive a decent little car with ample power so naturally i <unk> an opportunity to change lanes left pass him get over fly the bird out the window and still make my turn 
 i turn right and he follows me 
 i can tell he 's trying desperately to ride my ass and match my speed 
 this particular turn is quite difficult because it has some sharp corners that lead into each other 
 i 'm fully focused on <unk> my <unk> around these corners 
 nailed it 
 i 'm on the <unk> 
 i simultaneously look in my <unk> to check on shithead and hear my gf gasp 
 he 's spinning out of control incredibly violently 
 he <unk> that little kia two and a half rotations before screeching to a halt in a cloud of dust 
 mind you i still have n't looked forward because this road is extremely straight 
 i stick my arm out the window and fly him one last <unk> middle finger 
 i then look back at the road just in time to see a cop go by me towards the cloud of dust which housed said kia flip his lights on and pull the guy over 
 happiest road rage experience of my life.i was recently fired as a <unk> bus driver after clipping a tree with a side mirror pulling into a bus stop 
 this is something even experienced drivers do which were my bosses exact words 
 two days later i was told i was being let go because of my unsafe approach to bus stops as <unk> by the mirror incident and that the company was n't a training <unk> and did n't have the resources to waste training me '' even though i was explicitly hired as a <unk> 
 so the company i worked for is a <unk> to the local city councils and school services and provides contract based <unk> type work 
 since being fired between looking for new jobs i 've been posting complaints to the <unk> body that manages all the little bus companies in the region 
 about the state of the busses <unk> unsafe traffic behaviour rude and surly drivers and similar 
 just found out my former company missed out on 7 new school contracts and has not had 3 route service contracts renewed for the new year 
 the operations manager who fired me has not had *his* contract renewed for failing to maintain the standards of service and the spike in customer complaints 
 spiteful 
 you bet 
 lesson for next time it 's better to have me inside pissing out rather than outside pissing <unk> : i was really fucking drunk when i wrote this so it 's time for the <unk> edition 
 when i was in college and my sister moira was still in 10th grade there was this little bitch named victoria who bullied her 
 everyday she would call me about how much she hates the school and this really started to piss me off 
 one day skipped a class drove to the highschool to pick my sister up earlier than usual whatever i had like a fucking 150 and looked for the victoria 
 moira ran to me to pick her up but instead of opening the door i asked her where the girl was 
 she told me not to get physical as i had a history of getting <unk> in similar situations 
 not this time i told her 
 she pointed victoria out and i slowly drove next to her 
 <unk> huh this my shit all the girls stomp your feet like this* the song <unk> from my car and it made absolutely no sense at the time but i had a plan 
 she just looked confused as i slowly drove next to her as if i were picking her up 
 the next day victoria was leaving the school and as she was walking to her car : <unk> uh this my shit all the girls stomp your feet like this* the look on her face was priceless she was just speechless which was hilarious with the little <unk> playing in the background for a while 
 eventually this became a <unk> 
 kids would gather around to see if i was going to play the song and moira told me that people were starting to make fun of the victoria for it 
 i had no idea why the song <unk> girl by <unk> <unk> was getting to her so much but hey whatever works 
 every day for the two weeks i would pop in that copy of <unk> angel music <unk> and play that song 
 every time she would run to her car 
 eventually one day my sister told me victoria had stopped bullying her and from that day i stopped coming to the school 
 <unk> the teachers sent me an email about how i was n't acting like an adult and how if i agreed to stop coming to the school like an asshole they would crack down on the <unk> i feel like this is a long story 
 tldr at the end 
 a few years ago my ex and i lived with my mom 
 directly next door to my mom lived a kindly old lady and her <unk> about 15 we 'll call him caleb 
 we shared a back yard 
 according to relatives and other neighbors this kid was trouble 
 once caleb took a pack of cigarettes from our vehicle no idea how as we kept it locked and shot them up with a bb gun leaving the mess right in our driveway 
 the list of asshole moves he pulled goes on and on 
 but that 's not why i 'm telling this tale 
 he had this bike he rode all day every chance he could up and down the street with some other boys 
 on more than one occasion he left this bike in our driveway behind our vehicles 
 each time we put it in his yard out of harm 's way 
 well one day the bike goes missing 
 we have no idea how or why but caleb thought we took it i suppose 
 one day my ex was taking the dog outside to use the bathroom and she ran into caleb 's side of the yard and into the bushes 
 before my ex could get over there she was mysteriously gone 
 we spent hours looking for this dog 
 while we were doing this we see caleb outside with his friends laughing about something and staring at us 
 ex and i go over to ask if they 've seen the dog and they say no but offer to look with us 
 they were looking but not really looking '' 
 it was all really fishy 
 when we parted ways they sarcastically said good luck finding your dog '' 
 and laughed 
 days went by we thought she was dead 
 but after a while one of the kids from caleb 's group of friends brings the dog to caleb 's great-grandmother 's house 
 dog is back yay 
 we pretty much figured caleb took her because of the searching incident and the fact that every time the dog saw caleb she would <unk> and run inside 
 the poor thing was traumatized and was n't the same for months 
 even if he did n't take her he was a shit in many other ways and deserved what he got 
 while all this was going on the bike was in our yard again right behind the car 
 i guess caleb got it back 
 one night ex and i decided we 'd had enough and caleb needed to pay for hurting our dog 
 armed with the biggest knives we had along with some spray paint we <unk> up the bike 
 slashed the tires spray painted it pink and scratched <unk> '' into the metal 
 we went far into the woods behind an abandoned house on our street and tossed the bike into a giant <unk> bush 
 caleb did n't mess with us again 
 tldr : asshole teenage neighbor <unk> and <unk> our dog we fuck up his beloved bike and leave it in the woods edit : wow thanks for the gold 
 i did n't think people would actually read this 
 to clear some things up : <unk> did n't do anything directly to him because ex and i were <unk> and feared the law caleb was 15 we were 18/19 <unk> feel bike revenge was the best way to go because he loved that bike <unk> does n't live next door any more this story took place in late <unk> this summer we decided to cram ourselves into a car which we ended up sleeping in after the bars for sake of being to drunk to drive anywhere and drive down to canada 's big apple <unk> 
 our entire <unk> was to go to a young up and coming <unk> festival called <unk> 
 now i want everyone to remember were in canada the land of thank you 's and push <unk> 
 there was about 30 000 people at this outdoor festival in the middle of <unk> park .. <unk> beautiful <unk> beautiful people and fucking awesome music 
 at the begging of <unk> life 's set these girls decide they are not only going to be rude to to <unk> people behind them but they are also going to make the <unk> garbage problem even worse by taking 4 garbage <unk> dumping them out on the ground.. and <unk> to stand on them in the middle of a massive crowd 
 now that really was not that big of an issue to me 
 i was n't really paying attention to them at all but my boyfriend keeps telling me how <unk> pushing people off who are trying to join them on top of the barrels 
 i go over and ask politely if i can maybe get up on top of the barrels with them there is one free barrel and the girl looks at me and laughs me away saying no there is n't room and there will not be any room 
 kind of taken aback i walk away disappointed 
 i start watching them more closely and there was one or two people that managed to get themselves on top of the barrels too only to be immediately pushed back off an laughed at by these girls 
 my boyfriend has had enough of their <unk> attitude in a public place where everybody paid the same amount to be there he collects a few extremely willing people from around us and <unk> his revenge 
 the helping by <unk> happened to consist of another angry boyfriend two people who had been pushed and 3 people who were just annoyed to high heavens with these girls 
 they all <unk> together waiting for the next drop in the song to come 
 as it builds up and drops all 6 of them kick the tops of the barrels making all the girls <unk> to a horrible embarrassment that they brought upon themselves 
 they stand up and turn around for help or for someone to rat us out ... everybody kind of just laughed and cleared away without asking if they were ok or anything 
 sweet sweet revenge 
 we do have a video of it here if <unk> interested : original post here added some additional details that i had replied to in the comments in original post 
 reddit i am not proud of what i did and i do feel that karma will get me one <unk> i am prepared for it 
 i am embarrassed that a somewhat successful individual such as myself is capable of something so childish and embarrassing i 'm 26 
 i 'll try to make this short 
 **background : ** me and my ex had been together for about 1 <unk> long distance relationship he lived about 3 hours away 
 i find out from his sister that he was talking to other women when we were still together and <unk> with him lead nowhere with him saying that i am the only one on his mind and that he would never do that to me the usual spiel and that his sister does not know what she is talking about 
 i take his side because i loved him 
 <unk> weeks ago ** i find out from a mutual friend that he has been seeing and sleeping with this girl in his town i confront him about it and he flips everything around on me saying that its so hard for him to keep his dick in his pants while i am living so far away that i neglect him which i do n't i am the one that drives to see him every other weekend when i have the funds we call text skype each other daily that i do n't want him to live with me which is true because i do n't want to take care of a grown ass man and pay his bills 
 he says he loves me and wants to make it work and drops all contact the next day 
 i was heartbroken i talked to my friends and they said the girl he is hooking up with is an easy slut that has been around and that they are in a relationship the day after me and the ex had the <unk> probably even before then 
 <unk> weeks ago ** while still hurting heartbroken i <unk> my facebook and meticulously <unk> through my ex and his new love 's '' profiles 
 i know i should not have done this but whatever 
 i did not <unk> on their flirty messages but instead focused on her profile 
 i read through months of disgusting <unk> of her in a dirty dark bathroom with barely there clothes that even a <unk> would be embarrassed of being caught in 
 then i did it 
 i made a fake facebook profile of a <unk> looking man from google that used to go to her school '' 
 i befriended all of her friends made fake posts and befriended her 
 all of this took less than a day 
 you would be surprised at how many people would befriend you on facebook just from your looks regardless of if they know you or not 
 i had about 140 friends '' in just 2 hours and at that point people were requesting to be my friend every few minutes 
 i dunno who is more pathetic me or these <unk> just me probably 
 i started to chat her up the next day she was very open '' with herself even sending me new pictures of herself in little clothing to a complete stranger without any in return 
 being a woman myself it was easy to tell her what she wanted to hear 
 2-3 days later she was complaining about my ex to me already 
 i told her i wanted to meet up and will pick her up and show her what its like to be with a real man '' 
 at this point i had hours of conversations saved her saying the dirtiest shit that i 've ever read - pictures videos what have you 
 it was time 
 while all this was going on my ex started to contact me saying it was a mistake 
 i asked him if they had broken up he says yes twice and they were not obviously 
 this should have broken my heart but it didnt 
 i knew the truth but told him that yes i love him and that i want him to move in with me 
 he sounded happy <unk> whatever and said that he was going to give his 2 weeks to his boss that day 
 he texted me later and told me that he just left them with no notice instead because fuck em '' 
 he was going to start packing and will head out with everything later in the week 
 **the revenge 
 ** i posted all of the conversations up on fake facebook tagged her in it posted the pictures and videos for my ex 's eyes only and sat back and enjoyed the show before i deactivated the fake acc i had <unk> likes and <unk> messages 
 her family friends all saw it 
 my ex saw it and almost immediately texted me to say how he misses me he ca n't wait to be with me and does n't mention anything about the girl 
 friday rolls around and he tells me he is on his way to my apt 
 he does not know where i live because i recently moved 
 i tell him to meet me at a cvs close by so i direct him on where to go 
 he tells me he is almost out of gas and that i will have to help him put some in it 
 i agree and tell him that i will once he gets there 
 i get a text telling me he 's at the cvs and asks where i am 
 i ignore it 
 30 minutes later he blows up my phone 
 calls <unk> i made it a point to let it ring once so that he knows i send it to voicemail 
 1 hour <unk> he calls and leaves me a voicemail that he is worried and if i am ok. i am <unk> 
 2 hours later he says that he is stranded drove to another cvs thinking i was there but now he has no gas and is stranded at a gas station with his things in the car 
 calls ignored 
 i take an <unk> and go to bed 
 saturday morning 
 i have 37 text messages 28 missed calls and 7 voicemails from him and that he had to call his mom to come pick him up 
 since then i blocked his number and then had to change my number since he would then start calling me from his family 's phone and blocked calls 
 i get a <unk> on fb from his sister 
 she tells me he came home crying like a fucking baby and since his mom knows pretty much what happened between me and him she was not very <unk> but pretty upset with me 
 his sister thought i was a badass and deserved better than his lying cheating loser of a brother 
 i know i acted on impulse on all of this probably destroyed this girls life 
 i will probably <unk> fake profile to say sorry or whatever but maybe not 
 she did knowingly sleep with a man that had a <unk> <unk> him even 
 i know this sounds crazy but the feelings i had for my ex are still there 
 he will never forgive me since he is now unemployed and the whole town knows his business the girl admitted his dick is tiny 
 part of me <unk> everything and that i want him back with me 
 other part of me is glad i destroyed any type of <unk> as it was not going to work out in the end 
 feels good to let this out 
 **tldr : bf cheated created fake facebook to <unk> new <unk> worked 
 seemingly <unk> with ex but then left him stranded 3 hours away from home 
 ** <unk> bits of info i copied from comment replies : ** he was a friend for 2 years before asking me to be his gf 
 i left a lot of details out such as helping him financially with the car he has as well as food for him and his family because they would n't have had anything to eat otherwise 
 i stuck by this guy through his worst times the lowest point he was ever in 
 and he screws around on me with the slut of the town and lies about it many times 
 contacts me and gives me false hope and then disappears suddenly without an explanation so he can stick his dick in a dirty whore 
 i 'm rambling 
 she does n't know it was me just a random dude that put her shit on blast 
 i made a point not to share the <unk> only to my ex and even those were sent from fake facebook with face blurred out 
 the <unk> <unk> were there though so he knows its her 
 nobody has connected the dots yet 
 i tried to be careful about this 
 i lost <unk> yes but i do n't want him back 
 i have also booked a <unk> appointment thanks to him.i 've been in a long distance relationship with a cat for 3 years 
 the <unk> in question poof belongs to my boyfriend 's roommate - ned '' 
 ned is a douchebag really 
 just with less <unk> than the <unk> image and more crappy <unk> tattoos 
 ned was hired right out of college as a <unk> and loves leaving his <unk> slips around - showing that he makes over 100k a year 
 yet despite working 7 days a week granted <unk> shifts he fails to give proper care to his dog and cat 
 he 'll do things like leave the dog in it 's crate for <unk> hours a day run out of food for the animals then claim they 're on diets hardly walk his dog to the point where it 's socially dysfunctional and has overgrown nails 
 when my boyfriend and i are at the house he shares with ned we do the best we can to take care of the pets 
 any attempt to discuss their neglect is blown off by ned 
 over the years poof and i have become very attached 
 i take him to the vet get him groomed buy him food 
 the only reason i have n't adopted him is because i 'm away from home so much 
 ned told my boyfriend he needed to move out for june 1st 
 totally fine 
 ned is just as horrible a roommate as he is a human - but bf has stuck around because rent was cheap & amp the house was nice 
 he 'd been planning on buying a house - so getting the boot from ned 's place put that plan into motion 
 i 'm not going to leave poof with ned so i ask him one night if i could buy the cat from him 
 he 'd often bragged about how the cat was a <unk> deal at $ 50 ned who loves his possessions was unsure and said he 'd get back to me 
 next day he says i can have poof ... for $ 350 
 i cry 
 i 've paid way more than that in food vet bills and medication for this <unk> 
 i was laid off and have been <unk> so i 'm not really in the position to drop that much money on someone who 's emotionally already my pet 
 <unk> forward three months 
 * this weekend i 'm back at ned 's house - helping my partner pack 
 i have n't been back to the house since ned 's absurd offer of $ 350 a 9 year old cat with kidney issues 
 as we 're almost done ned comes up and says poof has died 
 or at least he ca n't find poof so he figures he got out the house and died outside 
 he <unk> it off 
 happened about a month ago 
 once again i <unk> 
 i let loose my years of fury on ned 
 telling him how i feel about his constant drunk driving abusing women <unk> lying animal neglect and horrible narcissistic personality 
 my partner and i get into the rented truck and drive to his new house 
 open the front door and i 'm greeted by my beloved poof - <unk> for attention 
 fuck you ned 
 two weeks after he said i 'd have to buy my geriatric cat from him i came over during the week and took poof 
 i wonder how long it look that douchebag to notice poof was gone 
 ned frequently comes home and passes out with the front door wide open - so the cat running away was <unk> plausible 
 now poof myself and my boyfriend have a little house where poof can sit on the <unk> and be a happy heavily loved <unk> 
 i 've also reported ned for animal cruelty for his dog 
 wanted to <unk> the little <unk> as well but it was n't possible 
 **tl dr** rule number one : do n't be a douchebag 
 here 's my fluffy love monster sitting like a gentleman on a car ride 
 <unk> do remember to read the whole article guys 
 it would be great if you could comment on the quality which could help me become better 
 : and dont forget to check out the other subs which have been featured 
 : d p.s : dont forget to upvote your feature at <unk> long time fan <unk> poster yadda yadda 
 we 're going back to the early <unk> for this one 
 lots of folks serving to stay out of <unk> or jail 
 very poor esprit de corp bad racial tension just general <unk> bad <unk> 
 four of us 20 somethings 3 white 1 black worked in a very technical niche <unk> now the job of highly paid contractors 
 our shop spaces located <unk> on an upper deck included a then high end paint booth 
 after hours it was the perfect 420 spot because of the highly filtered exhaust system 
 we could securely dog lock the <unk> smoke our <unk> <unk> and the fans took care of smoke <unk> even <unk> in emergencies 
 that thing really sucked in a good way 
 like fleet followers 
 finished up before evening chow popped out <unk> in a fit of <unk> only to bump into the chief petty officer henceforth known as red neck <unk> rnb 
 this asshole was <unk> by every <unk> and below aboard and nearly all the rest <unk> his ass kissing <unk> the master at arms and our bitter <unk> executive officer 
 rnb <unk> douchebaggery had previously included but was not limited to instances of bogus charges resulting in confinement with bread & amp water loss of pay & amp rank restriction to the ship extra duty just to name a few 
 his incompetence often put men <unk> in danger of serious injury or worse 
 thankfully the <unk> we worked for was an awesome <unk> and we did n't have to deal with rnb often 
 well he 's up in our country looking for our boss when he sees 4 young guys <unk> mixed oh my 
 way too happy pop out of an empty paint room 
 obviously up to no good 
 must be <unk> <unk> 
 from that point on he made it his mission to fuck with the four of us at every opportunity 
 he would borrow '' us for special details whenever he could 
 deck repair in the hot sun 
 check 
 clean <unk> from galley vents 
 check 
 clean rotted food from broken <unk> 
 check 
 stand the worst watches 
 snap inspections 
 the petty <unk> went on and on 
 as did his obvious enjoyment 
 one day he went too far 
 three of us were assigned to help clean the nuclear hold & amp <unk> 
 a job for which we had no training 
 no knowledge of <unk> 
 and to top it off he tried to send us below without the proper safety gear 
 thank the <unk> that the officer in charge was having none of that shit 
 we could have been seriously fucked put the ship hell the whole <unk> in serious <unk> 
 one of the gang got the idea while stuck putting a fresh coat of paint in the master at arms office 
 thanks again rnb he was able to <unk> plans for the ship 's first ever drug dog sweep 
 we wait until the day before the sweep 
 herb back then was cheap <unk> and often seedy 
 take the seeds up to the <unk> <unk> crush them against his locker door and rub vigorously 
 same for his rack 
 brick of shitty weed we 'd been burned with 
 under the front seat of his <unk> mustang next to a box of <unk> and a small scale 
 sit back and wait 
 payback is a motherfucker 
 did n't get to see it but we heard the dog went nuts on his locker and bunk 
 thorough search reveals nothing but <unk> are <unk> 
 enough so that his car was searched 
 with our intended result 
 he was taken away in handcuffs <unk> and crying 
 never to be seen again 
 we later heard that rnb got a <unk> and time in <unk> 
 should 've picked on somebody else <unk> happened to a very good friend of mine let 's call him vgf '' and i 've just recently stumbled upon this reddit 
 so now i want to share the story of him and this one <unk> this detail will be important later douchebag let 's call him db '' from our high school days who stole '' his girlfriend 
 the girl is n't <unk> in this story but even in high school we knew db was crushing hard on her 
 vgf wanted to jump him but she always said no that she 'd handle it herself 
 he trusted her and let it be 
 in time vgf went to college near his girlfriend but not at the same school 
 unfortunately db also attended her college and by our sophomore year she broke up with vgf and started dating db that same week 
 vgf was pretty crushed and it messed him up for years 
 <unk> db immediately started taunting vgf about now having his girl and so began an escalating revenge war 
 the first time was at a bar where i was present and db came up to our table all <unk> 
 after we told him to piss off db <unk> with a sneer fine 
 i 'll tell <unk> the girlfriend you cunts said hi 
 later 
 tonight '' while putting up two fingers and flicking his tongue 
 vgf turned in his seat and then shot back sure 
 do that 
 and while you 're at it tell me later how i taste '' 
 i bought my <unk> buddy all his beers that night 
 later on vgf told me that db had sent three guys after him after his shift ended at the local strip mall 
 vgf was a black belt in <unk> and the guys were just some thugs 
 vgf took some punches and had to fill out a police report but it was all recorded on mall security cameras that they threw the first punch 
 no sweat 
 the incidents continued over two years slowly escalating 
 finally it culminated with db <unk> up vgf 's car we have no evidence it was him but vgf lived literally two blocks from <unk> and the three of them saw each other regularly whenever db went to pick her up 
 that was the final straw and it took hundreds of dollars to fix the damage 
 now vgf was pretty handy as a designer this was before photoshop and our town was full of minority families 
 there 's a fairly strong italian <unk> but the rest are mostly latino -- mexican <unk> <unk> primarily -- and also indian and <unk> jewish 
 so he got it in his head to make a white <unk> <unk> and print up about a hundred copies 
 printed at the bottom was some <unk> organization with db 's phone number 
 he went off on a <unk> family vacation and got his fraternity brothers to leave the <unk> on car <unk> at a supermarket parking lot one busy sunday 
 no one got to see db 's reaction but vgf neither heard nor got any trouble from db again after that 
 edit : <unk> used to see this girl who <unk> a lot she 'd come to my county a few times a year and i 'd go to hers once or twice a year 
 the last time she was over we were having a few drinks with these guys i just met in a bar 
 she got quite drunk and when she was downstairs going to the toilet she bumped into one of the guys we just met and they hit it off 
 she took him into the toilet where they kissed and <unk> a blowjob but stopped before it finished like it mattered 
 they both came back to the table separately and continued having a laugh with me hindsight shows they were laughing at me 
 when we got home girl and me she confessed what happened 
 since it was late i told her she could sleep in my spare room and i then kicked her out in the morning and have n't seen her since 
 the guy on the other hand i had n't finished with 
 unbeknownst to him his friend had given me his card he thought he was quite the <unk> and through his facebook i found the guy and he had his website and email on his public facebook again quite the <unk> 
 i made a new gmail and facebook account which was the <unk> first name plus a common surname and emailed him along the lines hey i got your email address from your friend’s card i feel we had a connection and would like to see you when i 'm back in a few weeks 
 we emailed back and forth with me providing some photos i had of her as proof and he agreed to take a couple of days off work and drive <unk> to the <unk> hotel 
 as he would have been driving down i sent his girlfriend <unk> listed on his public fb page a facebook message from newly created girls account that said hi i 'm sorry to contact you but are you <unk> girlfriend '' 
 she replied yes who the fuck are you '' 
 i she explained how we met and what we did and that i was about to meet her boyfriend at a hotel 
 i told her now that i found out he has a girlfriend i feel sick 
 i give her the hotel phone number and his room number and tell her to ring saying it 's my name and see what happens 
 i also explained about the guy i was with me and that she should ring him to get some revenge sex 
 now i 'd like to say she contacted me she looked hot in her profile and sex was had but that was the last i heard from <unk> this is n't a story about me but instead my closest friend jjb of all time 
 i 've known jjb for well over 20 years ever since we were in elementary together 
 he 's <unk> racist <unk> and he really just does n't give a shit about getting into trouble unless it means going to jail 
 all in all he 's a great friend just stupid and makes many many mistakes that involve <unk> almost getting into fights or getting thrown out of a place due to drunken racial fueled <unk> of his 
 but to my story he has horrible taste in women 
 they all are just like him but worse 
 drug using neo-nazi <unk> binge drinking chicks that would make the wild and wonderful <unk> give them <unk> 
 jjb 's ex from about two years ago broke up with him and wanted to move out saying that she was moving back to her mother 's 
 but come to find out she was moving in with a guy she was dating on the side 3 days after their breakup 
 jjb finds out goes straight to a bar to <unk> his <unk> then drives home 
 on his way home he passed by a <unk> deer that was lying there from the day before and being as redneck as he is he threw it into the bed of his truck so he could keep the head and <unk> when it became a skull as <unk> for his house 
 that 's normal for him trust me 
 <unk> forward to about <unk> he calls me and tells me to come over because it 's urgent 
 i go over and see the bed of his truck just covered in blood and hair with an <unk> and saw inside 
 i fucking freak out and about to call the cops thinking he just <unk> his ex or something but he stops me in time and told me it was from a deer then shows me the head on the side of his house 
 we go inside it smells fucking amazing inside his house like thanksgiving good 
 i see a pot on the stove and asked him what he was cooking jjb then <unk> me to the back door and pointed out towards a pile of rotting fly <unk> bone poking through the skin gutted and bloody <unk> <unk> of the deer ... and says that '' 
 i almost fucking hurled 
 he stayed up all night looking up chili recipes to make the perfect kind from deer meat 
 then cooked it to give to his ex and her new boyfriend as a no hard feeling <unk> guys '' 
 kind of gift 
 admittedly it smelled and looked delicious 
 but neither of us tried it 
 later that day jjb goes to his ex 's new house after washing his truck and gives them the chili then tells them to just go ahead and keep the pot too '' 
 so this story takes place around early 2013 i was walking around the city with my friends some of which are <unk> as we teens are wont to be and we walked past a planned <unk> clinic with all the fundies in front of it with their dead <unk> signs and jeering so one of my friends flipped them off 
 that would have been the end of the story but unfortunately for me i had to bike past the church they came from to get to school every morning and one of them recognized me 
 i cycled away as they <unk> and yelled the usual burn in hell <unk> '' 
 and went to school 
 i got tired of this of course it was a rather <unk> way to start my day 
 i started going to the church learning how to get back at them for making my mornings annoying i told them that i <unk> i told them my friend was n't a friend but just a guy that one of my friends knew and of course i was n't friends with a <unk> like that 
 i learned that the pastor used lots of youtube videos and lots of online presentations to preach that the church had been <unk> a lot and had lots of power outlets in corners of cabinets and such and finally that it had an open wifi network 
 i had a friend that had an old phone that he wanted rooted i rooted it for him in exchange for being able to borrow it for a month i rooted the phone and installed three apps a remote access tool that let me control the phone from my computer a wifi organization tool i walked around the neighborhood where the church was and let it <unk> all the open networks and told it to connect to either the church 's wifi or any new open wifi in case the played with the router and the crown <unk> a <unk> <unk> i set up to redirect at random all web pages to either rick <unk> lol <unk> michael <unk> <unk> or old greg and pause for 30 seconds every five minutes so i could control it if i wanted to 
 i took this phone to the church with a charger found a cupboard with an outlet in it that looked like it was n't used often and set it up 
 at the <unk> the pastor gave his usual ra ra speech before trying to open a <unk> and it <unk> to michael <unk> <unk> a lot he refreshed the page old greg again <unk> again <unk> <unk> i had to go to the bathroom and laugh because they were so confused i left it there for a month occasionally adding new pages just to <unk> it up they were incredibly confused and upset 
 i took it back and returned it to my friend and never went to that church again and changed my <unk> route so they would n't yell at me 
 tl dr angry fundies got mad at me and yelled at me on my way to school so i <unk> them big <unk> so this story belongs to <unk> and can be read in this link however i 'll copy it in here because of the rules 
 here it goes : & gt when a kid is being a brat in a noisy and public area i casually get close to them and fart on their <unk> 
 i 'm really tall so it 's usually a direct hit 
 & gt & gt it 's funniest when the kid notices and does n't know what to do because i 'm a fucking giant and i 'll eat them if they tell their mommy 
 & gt & gt if i decide to stare it 's usually with a yeah what the fuck are you gon na do about it '' 
 look 
 & gt & gt i 'm about 6'7 '' so even when i 'm just trying to be friendly i.e 
 not farting on a <unk> kid 's head and meeting a family member 's or friend 's kid for the first time i 've noticed they get very <unk> between their mother 's legs intimidated on sight if i 'm not sitting down 
 so it 's not hard for me to <unk> a child especially when i 'm trying to 
 & gt & gt however a few times i 've been called out 
 one time i was pretty drunk with a friend at a target buying risk and no we never finished playing the whole game 
 this little mexican <unk> year old with a <unk> was being an insufferable little shit in the action figure section 
 i heard him from like 5 aisles over and it was like nails on a <unk> 
 i tell my friend i 'm gon na fart on this kids head 
 watch and learn '' 
 & gt & gt i <unk> on over to the aisle in question and see the vile little prick calling his mom an idiot '' for not buying him a huge fucking <unk> 
 joe the movie vehicle which pissed me off even more considering how awful that movie was 
 buy some good toys 
 i already bought that one for you and you broke it by throwing it down the stairs '' shut up 
 i need it 
 it 's the only one i do n't have now '' 
 the mother was younger than me i 'm mid twenties and gave a defeated look i do n't have enough money right now '' 
 you are an idiot '' and continued to just berate and publicly shame this woman 
 & gt & gt at the time i was on a strict <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 and while i was watching all this my stomach gave me an initial warning <unk> very courteous stomach telling me i was about an hour away from <unk> the toilet 
 <unk> 
 <unk> 
 & gt & gt i inch a bit closer to my prey inspecting some wrestling toys and pondering the weird <unk> of the whole <unk> in general 
 the kid shouts fuck you i hate you '' 
 the mom rolls her eyes and turns her back to the kid to ignore him 
 and could you believe it the kid gets on his hands and knees and starts taking the toy out of the box 
 it 's go time motherfucker 
 & gt & gt i position my back towards him and at this point am like 2 feet away from him 
 his head is down getting frustrated with those god damn <unk> tie things and i go for the kill 
 i bend down to reach for the one of the toys on the lower shelf 
 at this point my ass is inches away from this kids head 
 & gt & gt now generally speaking the best way to go about this is to act casual drop your belly bomb then walk away after a few seconds like nothing is out of the ordinary 
 i usually go one aisle over and listen to the kid 's reaction in delight 
 however today i could n't help myself 
 i have my head <unk> back looking at this kid out of the corner of my eye to ensure accuracy 
 & gt & gt i 'm so close that from a distance it looks like i 'm about to sit on him 
 my friend sees this happening and can no longer contain himself 
 he 's covering his mouth but his <unk> hyperventilating <unk> <unk> is fairly audible over the late 90 's pop <unk> playing on the <unk> 
 & gt & gt the kid immediately looks up towards the laughter but ca n't help but notice there is an ass now directly in his face 
 now i 'm trying not to laugh but also panicking as i just made eye contact with him 
 he <unk> his brow and i look over in the mother 's direction still back towards us 
 i relish in the moment and the look on this child 's confused and naive face 
 & gt & gt the initial blast was <unk> and <unk> 
 i swear i saw his hair blowing in the wind so to speak 
 if i was n't wearing jeans i think it could have probably blown over an empty soda can 
 i would call it a very fun fart '' <unk> would buy again 
 however what immediately followed that out the chamber was truly horrifying 
 the fart 's <unk> changed without notice and swiftly 
 it went from a <unk> dry <unk> squeal to a nefarious <unk> <unk> 
 i think the little <unk> noticed the hateful <unk> before even i did because he <unk> his neck violently trying to get away from the personified evil being <unk> into his soul 
 because of his <unk> hovering over the toy hands and knee it was all in vain as the only way out was forward ... and forward would mean certain death 
 i had positioned myself well on the higher ground free to escape or relent at any time and him poor and <unk> : <unk> his time until the cruel attack was over 
 obviously this child needed to <unk> sun tzu 
 & gt in total it lasted about 4 seconds but for that kid it must have seemed like time was frozen 
 the long-term severe brain damage which he no doubt suffered only added to that effect 
 & gt when i finished with my <unk> i.e 
 forcing a little boy to huff my <unk> there was a silent pregnant pause 
 the kid was clearly shocked and stunned 
 no one had ever stood up to this <unk> sociopath in his whole life 
 i had taken the words out of his mouth and filled it with fart 
 & gt & gt i make my move first picking up the toy i was reaching for '' off the low shelf take a few steps forward and stare at it for a few seconds 
 on <unk> <unk> the only thing the kid could manage to do was burst into tears 
 my friend senses danger 'the <unk> is up and his head <unk> for cover 
 the mom turns around to see her kid with an open toy crying on the floor and me minding my own business 
 & gt she walks up to him and asks what 's wrong but the kid ca n't speak 
 all he gets out is <unk> '' 
 it took every <unk> in my body not to laugh 
 i put the toy back on a middle shelf turn around give a final <unk> <unk> and then begin to take my exit 
 & gt <unk> that his assailant was getting away scot-free he somehow managed to <unk> himself for a moment 
 he shouts he <unk> on me '' 
 i could feel him pointing at me but i continued to act like i was just browsing 
 i was almost around the corner when the mom goes : & gt & gt - excuse me ... .sir ... .sir '' 
 & gt i turn around <unk> - '' uh ... who 
 me '' 
 - while pointing to myself 
 & gt - yes 
 did you just fart on my son '' 
 & gt <unk> my options i played dumb 
 - what 
 i mean i did fart '' 
 & gt - on my son '' 
 & gt - well i mean technically speaking ... i mean ... what is <unk> '' 
 & gt - why did you fart on my son '' 
 & gt at this point the little kid has the look of schadenfreude on his face happy to see me in trouble 
 fuck you i 'm a man 
 i will fart on you if i please 
 i turn my attention to the little kid and stare at him & gt - because the whole store could hear him being a little rotten asshole to his mother so i thought i 'd come over here and treat him like one '' 
 & gt & gt the mom looks at me her son and the scattered gi <unk> on the floor 
 the mom is puzzled as to what to do and says - <unk> go '' 
 - that 's my cue 
 i turn around walk away with little extra step 
 i look up to see the black <unk> of security cameras and all the stories on reddit about <unk> having to register as a sex offender flash before my eyes 
 as soon as i turn the corner i book it outside as fast as i can while dialing my friend 
 like a true friend he is right out front with the engine running and risk in the trunk 
 & gt & gt we laugh on the car ride back about the whole scene 
 with a slight hint of seriousness in his tone my friend asks me : & gt & gt - do you do that a lot '' 
 & gt - ahhh not that much 
 like once every 6 months or so '' 
 & gt & gt we both knew i was lying 
 we got to our other friends house played risk until 4 in the morning while drinking scotch 
 overall i would say it was a <unk> <unk> good <unk> : this is not my revenge story but one i thought you guys would like the story : so there is this guy who is a professional landscaper and he was contracted to do a big job for someone the whole deal 
 completely <unk> the garden and basically making it look amazing so i hear but he had one problem he did n't get paid ... the revenge : now this guy doesnt like not getting paid i have another story about him so what he does is magic after weeks of trying to get paid he had enough 
 he put on a <unk> suit and a mask he jumped into his van and drove to he house went to the garden and sprayed a kill everything '' weed killer over every thing 
 the best part is it took 3 days for them to notice and there was nothing they could do about it ... so when i was a teenager we had the dick neighbor 
 you know the one that to call the cops has to just hit redial 
 so after years of him yelling at us for playing ball to near his house or how we needed to cut our grass shorter because it was n't even with his and looked bad 
 or the party after party he had the cops show up at our house 
 and not even teen drinking parties either 
 just normal ones my folks were having with the music set to like 7 finally i just could not take it anymore after the last thing 
 so its a saturday afternoon in july 2pm my friends and i are out playing with our cars as teen age boys do ie <unk> a engine etc 
 suddenly the cops show up we are all wtf 
 after talking with us asking about what we are doing 
 he finally says ok and heads to our neighbors house tells the guy that at 2 oclock on a saturday afternoon is when we are suppose to be making noise and not to call again 
 i decided ok fuck this already 
 so about 3 am i sneak over his place and remove all his <unk> nuts 
 at 7 am i am woken up to a loud thunk and cursing 
 i look out my window see his car in the street all four tires are off the <unk> and pushed up into his <unk> 
 he still was the dick neighbor but i had a smile on my face when i saw him 
 and thought of the time and money i cost <unk> : i 'm not sure if this really belongs here so please let me know if i should move it 
 i apologize for the shitty grammar and formatting it 's not my <unk> point and i suck at explaining things 
 i posted a <unk> down version of this as a comment in <unk> but i 'll add more detail here 
 this started about 15 years ago when i was 9 my friends and i were just a normal group of kids who enjoyed everything from playing with sticks to building <unk> out of <unk> 
 we were harmless and stayed out of trouble 
 anyway this asshole whom i shall refer to as anal decided it was in his interests to bully us 
 keep in mind that i 'm talking about a fully grown 40 year old man at the time 
 one day we were doing our usual stuff and kicking a ball around in a mostly empty car park only anal 's car was there and we were nowhere near it 
 now this creep must have been watching us from his house which was about <unk> metres away because as soon as the ball rolled near his car he came sprinting out like a nutjob and snatched the ball 
 we asked for it back and naturally he said no so we had to get my friend 's dad to get it 
 anal lied and told him that we were jumping on his car and kicking the ball against it so we got into trouble 
 this had started to happen quite often to the point of our parents doubting him but not doing anything about it because it was n't really worth the drama and time 
 we eventually started to hang about with his son fedora 
 fedora was pretty cool at first but he started acting like an idiot i do n't mean normal kids stuff 
 he would scream in your ear or spit on you thinking it was hilarious he also had a really high pitched laugh like a damn <unk> 
 we decided to distance ourselves from him and not bother with him but he kept coming back 
 now to make things worse his dad always seemed to be watching somehow because every time fedora got injured he would be straight out to blame and accuse us of bullying 
 example 1 : fedora <unk> into a lamp post and knocked himself out anal went apeshit and threatened our parents that if we continued '' he would call the police 
 example 2 : fedora fell off his scooter in front of his dad and anal told our parents we did it 
 example 3 : he got stuck up a lamp post and once again we got the blame 
 when we were 14 anal really went too far this time 
 we kicked our ball over his fence by accident and he was in the garden ready he popped his head over looking all smug but luckily my friend 's mother could see through the kitchen window 
 anal came outside ready to complain but my friend 's mother was ready for it and could n't be bothered to deal with his shit 
 she asked him if he could pass it back and what did he say 
 fuck off you cunt '' 
 now my friend 's dad had heard this and his eyes caught fire 
 keep in mind that he is really well built while anal is a skinny little shit who can only talk big 
 anal only ended up with a black eye because he managed to scramble away and call the police luckily nothing was really done about it because it was our words over his 
 time went on and he kept trying shit but now we were hormonal teens so this was a mistake on his part because we had nothing to lose gave no shits and knew how much he loved his car 
 one night we shoved dog shit up his exhaust pipe and sealed it off with a used <unk> used his <unk> to poke more shit covered his handles in shit rubbed <unk> on his windows and let his tires down 
 that was when it all started 
 when it <unk> we tried wrapping his car in <unk> film and poured warm water over it to get it to freeze over but it did n't work out too well so we just covered it in snow and it stuck really well 
 this helped the water freeze over and give him a hell of a job getting it off 
 sometimes we would just steal his <unk> or simply let down two tires other times we would just piss against it 
 other things we did to him would be petty stuff like hiding his bin on bin day so the <unk> did n't empty it pelting his house with a dozen eggs on halloween post shit through his letter box etc 
 i had a feeling he knew it was us because he bothered us a lot less 
 i 'm 24 now it 's been at least 5 years since we last messed with him because we are all getting on with our lives and definitely doing better than him 
 he tries acting friendly with me but keeps his distance 
 the lesson of this story is that those kids you fuck with will one day grow up and it will be too late to realize that you 've <unk> a fucking <unk> so i am a bouncer 
 proof : username 
 i know this is long but there is a tl dr at the bottom there are nights however when i go to the bar and drink on my nights off 
 this was one of those nights 
 so it 's a wednesday night at the bar and i 'm off 
 wednesdays are greek night and $ 5 pitchers of whiskey and coke 
 and they make the drinks very strong 
 so the bar is full of drunk frat guys and shitfaced <unk> girls 
 now i have no problem with <unk> i was greek myself in college 
 i do have a problem with self entitled little fuckers who think that they 're above everyone else 
 so i 've been sitting at the bar for a few hours drinking and chatting with my co workers and it 's around <unk> a.m. the bar has a good amount a people in it 
 well i 've been talking to this girl at the bar and she wants to go dance 
 i like to think my big ass can get down so i oblige 
 we 're dancing for a while when i see this <unk> fuck ass dick <unk> walk in to the dancefloor area 
 he 's a part of the douchebag fraternity on campus 
 the guys that jump people in the parking lot for looking at a girl wrong the guys that ca n't get in trouble on campus because they 've been there for so long the self entitled assholes that do what they want because they think they 're invincible 
 so this guy his name can be p for pussy comes in the bar drunker than a three <unk> deer riding an <unk> 
 he 's grabbing at the shot girls and causing a <unk> all around 
 hey it 's my night off i ai n't dealing with this shit 
 but i keep an eye on him just in case i need to intervene 
 once you 're a bouncer you stay a bouncer 
 he 's bumping guys and yelling fuck you 's to everyone that looks at him weird 
 he 's looking for a fight tonight 
 well p seems to settle down a little bit and he gets on the dancefloor about 10 feet away from me 
 he 's dancing i say dancing he looked like a 7th grader and he keeps rubbing his hands all over her ass and legs 
 he gets a little ambitious and starts going for her <unk> to finger her i imagine 
 she keeps slapping his hand away 
 after a few times he gets visibly frustrated 
 he decides that he 's getting what he wants and goes straight to stick his hand up her skirt 
 she pushes him away with an oh my gosh get away from me '' expression 
 he tries to grab her again and she pushes him and yells no 
 he grabs her even hard so she spits in his face 
 this all happened in a few seconds 
 well what happened next made me the <unk> i have ever been in my life 
 he slapped her across the face 
 hard 
 so hard she fell to the ground 
 now i can stand a lot but you do n't ever put your fucking hands on a woman 
 i see red 
 i yell mother fucker '' 
 and go over to him as fast as i can the dance floor was pretty packed and i shove him against some railing that <unk> the dance floor 
 he swings and <unk> me 
 from what the other bouncers tell me it was a hard hit 
 i barely felt a thing due to the alcohol and anger 
 i swing back around and come down on his nose with my fist 
 it was an awkward punch but powerful 
 he <unk> back against the railing 
 i do n't know why i did this i guess i watched too much wrestling as a kid 
 i ran at him and <unk> him and myself over the railing 
 i roll over on top of him and just start hitting him as hard as i could everywhere 
 the face the chest the neck i wanted to cause as much pain as possible to this mother fucker who would dare hit a girl 
 i was eventually pulled off by the other bouncers 
 but right before i was i <unk> the fuck out of him 
 p just laid there not unconscious but not moving and definitely in a lot of pain 
 his nose was crooked probably broken and blood poured down all of his face 
 his face was red his lip busted and his shirt was torn 
 i had teeth marks in my forehead and my jaw hurt 
 the whole incident happened in a short amount of time but it felt like forever 
 the bouncers picked him up and threw him out of the bar 
 they said if he ever comes back they 'll beat his face in 
 my boss gave me a ride home and said he would have to write me up for having a fight 
 i did n't care 
 i was still so angry 
 the girl he hit is okay 
 i was just so <unk> mad that anyone would dare lay a hand on a girl and i wanted to do what i can so he could never hit a girl again 
 i have a friend in that fraternity who did n't care for p too much 
 he told me that p had two black eyes for a few days his nose is broken his tooth is crooked and get this he broke his thumb punching me in the jaw 
 from what i hear he wanted to press charges but once his parents found out that he hit a girl they would n't let him 
 since they pay for every single thing he does they have the power 
 i hope that mother fucker remembers me for the rest of his life and takes that night as a lesson 
 i know that there are gon na be some of you that read this and want to bitch me out and say that was stupid and that i 'm a horrible bouncer for having a fight at work 
 there 's always a few of you 
 well fuck y'all 
 i do n't know what y'all 's <unk> are but i do n't stand hitting women 
 y'all can get on another thread and bitch to someone who gives a shit 
 tl dr drunk asshole is drunk 
 tries to sexually assault a girl she spits in his face 
 he hits her 
 i see red and go after him 
 punch kick <unk> and hurt this guy 
 he gets a broken nose thumb two black eyes and busted lips 
 he wants to press charges but his parents wo n't let him because they found out he hit a girl 
 also titties 
 edit : i admit this is more <unk> than anything else 
 if you knew the guy on a personal level like i do though you would understand how it 's revenge for me 
 he causes a lot of problems in the bar he 's lead <unk> of my friends in the parking lot and he 's just a general douchebag to most 
 he needed to be taught a lesson 
 now whether or not y'all decide that this is revenge or not i posted this for people to enjoy and relish that an asshole got <unk> so i just recently discovered this subreddit and i love you all 
 the revenge stories are perfect so i figured i 'd share one of mine from a while ago 
 <unk> to middle school 
 i 'm maybe 13 or so short little chubby and the new kid in a public school former <unk> school student 
 so i 'm <unk> socially awkward as my former classmates i had known for years 
 now i was at a school where i knew no one 
 naturally this made me a target for bullying 
 so introducing the primary bully wangster as he was a <unk> boy who thought wearing <unk> <unk> 's and listening to lil <unk> made you a <unk> well everyday we had a reading block 
 nerdy me lost his mind when i discovered the school had a library with actual books 
 i read the entire harry potter series in two weeks 
 well i 'd get to reading block a bit earlier and usually the teacher would let me sit in the class to get that extra time with the wonderful <unk> world 
 wangster and his friends would show up sit directly behind me taunting me 
 they were smart and were only loud enough for me to hear and not the teacher 
 when she would leave wangster would pull the same stunt 
 hey that 's my chair '' followed by the seat i was using being pulled directly out from under me 
 i 'd hit my head on the desk and even got a bruise once 
 after the fourth time i did what any sensible kid would do and reported it to the teacher 
 now the teacher knew that i had a rough time <unk> to school so she confronted wangster and his friends 
 of course they all back each other up and nothing came about 
 well that 's a lie 
 after wangster found out i reported him the bullying got worse 
 i 'd be shoved into lockers in the hallway get food knocked out of my hand at lunch and my books mysteriously started disappearing i kept multiple to bring home and read 
 seriously i fucking love reading 
 so one day i decided to get my revenge 
 during this entire time he still kept <unk> gag and thought it was the funniest shit 
 so one day i sat reading yet another book 
 when the walked in i stopped reading but faked looking like i was n't paying attention 
 the teacher left the room for a moment probably to get water or something 
 that 's when wangster made his move 
 watch this '' he whispered 
 i carefully lifted my weight up off the chair 
 hey that 's my ... '' <unk> 
 i stood up as fast as i could snapping my knees sending the chair flying behind me 
 now while i was a <unk> kid i had also been playing tennis both <unk> and <unk> for about five years 
 the chair flew back <unk> him square in the <unk> 
 he <unk> over tears almost <unk> in his face 
 the teacher walked in to see wangster almost crying and me <unk> a shocked look on my face 
 what happened '' 
 i 'm so sorry wangster 
 i did n't know you were behind me '' 
 i apologized 
 i turned around to help him up to which he smacked my arm away 
 fuck you <unk> '' 
 he whispered under his breath 
 here you take this chair 
 i 'll grab another '' 
 i said with a grin just quiet enough for him to hear me 
 that concludes my story for now i 've got a couple others involving wangster and his comrades 
 <unk> has since been removed but this was obtained from the <unk> version 
 ** i had to come on here and get some kind of <unk> perspective because currently no one else in the family knows that the reason sil is deported is because of my wife 
 not sure i should out her either in my current state of mind 
 sorry if this is <unk> 
 my mind is currently in chaos 
 background : we have been together for 8 years no kids 
 basically all of this began when my brother and sil moved back to our home country after he had been living in sil 's country 
 prior to that my wife <unk> did n't have an issue with sil 
 my wife and sil are both from the states but my wife has been living with me in my home country since we got married 
 my brother and sil are what some people might call <unk> 
 sil is from portland something wife rolls her eyes at and is very hipster '' 
 they both smoke regularly something i do n't have an issue with but do n't feel like getting involved with either 
 my wife has no issues with <unk> use but she ca n't stand how much my brother and sil talk about pot whenever we see them 
 six months ago my wife decided to finish her master 's degree and was offered an opportunity to do a semester abroad
