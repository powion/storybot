 for first time offense the code enforcement officer told of his work in <unk> me parking in my own back yard multiple times 
 the judge bought it and fined me $ 1,000 
 first time offense 
 i <unk> and had to pay $ 400 dollars for the court transcript 
 unfortunately for the judge and the code enforcement officer a different party won the <unk> and council majority 
 and the new thin <unk> did n't care for the judge nor the code enforcement officer 
 nor did the <unk> think it was funny when i handed him the court transcript 
 he agreed it was <unk> 
 i mostly won on appeal 
 fine <unk> to $ 250 the county appeal judge said he had a handicap sticker on his car 
 would i please apply for a doctor 's letter and show it to the local police chief 
 yes this happened now i could legally park any place in my yard without <unk> from the town 
 prorevenge part : oh yes the judge and the code enforcement officer 
 the judge lost his appointment the thin <unk> did n't like him 
 the judge subsequently ran for <unk> on a third party line and came in last 
 the code enforcement officer was down sized in short order and soon <unk> employed and without the town pick up truck he drove 
 <unk> he had been in construction most of his life and there was no work available at this time so the town job had been a <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> 
 in my experience when people do bad things to one person they usually do it to more than one person 
 so i was just a major push in helping 2 town official lose their jobs 
 <unk> thank you mr. thin <unk> <unk> plus it is good to complain about bad government service to the highest local authority 
 been parking in my back yard near my back door for 6 years 
 like the convenience 
 edit 1 : <unk> not <unk> spelling 
 ca n't always <unk> 
 can laugh at my mistakes 
 edit 2 loved when the <unk> judge forced the town to pay me back $ 750 
 made a copy for my records 
 edit 3 <unk> cancer is nothing to laugh at 
 men should have their <unk> checked 
 in answer to <unk> about sexual problems 
 i suggest you tag : sir <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> problems post operation

 edit 4 : **tl dr** special <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> thinks he is getting away with stuff 
 called out by redditors was not even revenge some said 
 did take some advice and lay down stone to park car in back of house 
 still a happy camper and enjoyed all the posts 
 first of all i do not know how appropriate this story is but i want to share it with you 
 there was this guy from primary school who was a total jerk to me right from the moment we first met 
 he would make stupid jokes and comments about everything remember i was 7 or so even the most dumb shit can used as an insult 
 i was a shy boy and had trouble becoming friends with others but i had a few and this jerk would tell lies in order to <unk> our friendship 
 and since he was one of the top students maybe even the best my teacher would n't believe me 
 anyway after we graduated from primary school we both ended up in the same class of the same <unk> school 
 for me it was like a new chapter since there were some people i already knew and was friends with and i decided to stop being lazy and my grades became better 
 jerk could n't stop mocking me or trying to break my <unk> well his tactics were less effective since i knew then and was prepared also i got used to be a little bit of a loner 
 one day i had the idea how fight him back i could hit him since i was stronger but that did not seem to be the right thing for me 
 we got our math exams back and i had a slightly better grade than him and i could see his anger in his eyes 
 he could n't <unk> that it was me who was better than him 
 so i decided to get better in every class i even got 12 of 11 or <unk> of <unk> but that 's a different story 
 and finally in the 8th grade i accomplished my goal i became the best student <unk> my class which till then always was jerk my friends <unk> me and our teacher gave me an ice cream in class a <unk> and i had the permission to eat it in class 
 he never ever brought any present before nor after 
 it was like the cherry on top of your cream that he brought the ice cream at that day 
 jerk was furious he also cried a little maybe due to his anger the others mocked him for crying 
 after that he never ever did anything again he was broken he let himself go socially and in school he hardly made his graduation later 
 he became addicted to drugs and lives a life as a scumbag who wasted his <unk> and i realised that i lost my <unk> and that somehow i owe him something since he is the reason i started to learn harder than i used to 
 i wrote this on my mobile so i apologize for possible <unk> <unk> 
 tl dr : became better in school than my bully and it crushed him.i 'm a uni student me and six others live in this house together 
 when we moved in we <unk> a fridge off the previous tenants 
 apparently some group bought it six years ago or so and each year the new tenants simply paid <unk> to them to keep the fridge since it does n't belong to the estate agents 
 it 's been done exactly the same for 6 years or so 
 our year is very nearly up this sunday and we showed the new tenants around a week or so ago 
 apparently they flat out refused to pay up for the fridge 
 said fridge is *very* large and easily doubles the space for food and with 7 people it 's pretty much necessary 
 it 's a fair bet they 7 <unk> <unk> stereotypical dicks you met in school are expecting to get it for free since none of us can just take it with us 
 i do not intend to let them have this pleasure 
 why here and not pettyrevenge 
 i do n't <unk> petty revenge 
 i want absolute full revenge that denies them a free fridge not to just leave it all filthy in part because i doubt they 'll care my current plan is to simply break the plug some how 
 cut the power cable in half or just snap off the plug <unk> things 
 opinions 
 ideas 
 best plan gets used 
 only rule is it ca n't be overly <unk> 
 like i cant leave the fridge full of rotten food 
 yes it 's <unk> our property we paid for it and the estate agents told us it 's none of their business at the start of the year but still i 'm <unk> to just ram it with cheese and leave for fear that they might keep some deposit 
 though i <unk> tempted to just drag it out onto the back road or to a tip or <unk> all happened when i was brought back to the headquarters company to replace a sergeant that was getting out 
 to go over everything dickbag did to deserve it would take hours 
 i only had to deal with him for a few months before going to my line company and then on the tail end when i came back so this was for everyone that never got a chance to get theirs 
 when staff sergeant <unk> first came to us from another unit he wanted to check every <unk> number used to organize the army 's supply on every item even <unk> sitting right next to eachother 
 generally i could understand that some of the <unk> items are expensive 
 but when there are three rows of 4 <unk> <unk> with the bags on each and contents laid out exactly the same you do n't need to look at every single one mother fucker 
 it was n't just <unk> and <unk> though 
 fucking <unk> gloves tongue <unk> everything 
 every 
 single 
 item 
 when he was leaving <unk> he got pissed at me because i was n't willing to sign for any equipment until the two of us checked every single <unk> on every item 
 when my <unk> leader told me i was signing for a treatment set i went to ask <unk> summer 's eve what time he wanted to do it the following day 
 he wanted to do it then and there because he had staff duty 24 hour shift sitting at <unk> hq that night 
 at about <unk> my squad got everything laid out 
 i called <unk> 
 douche <unk> and said i was ready for him and told my <unk> to go home and have a good night 
 about 45 minutes he was a 5 minute walk from where i was later i could smell his <unk> ass coming 
 he walked up to me handed me the <unk> form used to track who is in possession of what items and a pen and started staring at his phone 
 when i walked over to start checking item by item he said something to the effect of what you doing <unk> <unk> sign that <unk> just a note he 's a white dude from the streets '' in the <unk> who claims to be <unk> <unk> i got ta get back to <unk> remember turd is staff duty <unk> to relieve my <unk> for chow '' 
 when i told him i was n't signing anything until i was sure everything was present he looked like he was going to have a <unk> <unk> snatched the <unk> out of my hand and did his best impression of a <unk> <unk> 
 i was satisfied i did n't mind putting it back myself 
 i knew that phase 1 was complete 
 we were going to need to start from scratch the following day after he had been up all night 
 at <unk> the following day my squad and i arrived in the <unk> 
 right after he got off staff duty 
 i called <unk> <unk> and told him i was in the motor pool 
 when he got there i started laying everything out and i honestly thought he was going to cry 
 by the time we finished i think it was <unk> he did n't go back to the company to grab his stuff just headed home 
 when i got back after getting some food i noticed his <unk> bag '' sitting on his desk open 
 i took out his <unk> <unk> '' he was terrible at all things physical shock doctor mouth guard and put it between my balls and asshole on an especially humid day 
 he was gone the next day 
 fuck that <unk> <unk> douche <unk> <unk> them their half of rent while pay got switched over '' and he asked me to wipe his computer for him i 'm a geek because he said he wanted to donate it and scrub tax etc info off it before 
 turns out fucker was hiding in a different province having been found guilty awaiting <unk> 
 and to be clear this was n't <unk> 16 year olds in browser <unk> he <unk> '' thousands of images and videos of <unk> year olds getting raped 
 i found out several days after he left when my friend '' <unk> who i 'll mention later on who said they would be good roommates fessed up 
 and seeing how his fucked up girlfriend was on disability for <unk> '' and did n't have another income any longer shit got really sketchy weird desperate and being nice but only in order to be manipulative '' because she had no possible way of making next month 's rent - let alone paying me back - and that required another victim to move in to pay the rent 
 i moved my expensive stuff out of the house and she started acting funny so i started video recording everything 
 she ended up calling the cops on me to try and get me fucked on assault charges 
 i went outside with my laptop with the recordings waited for the cops and showed them the video 
 ended up ok but that could have gone <unk> badly 
 but i was n't on the lease stupidly - so the cops suggested strongly i leave so i did 
 police never charged her for a false complaint which was unfortunate 
 after moving i reported them for welfare fraud he got a <unk> a few days before heading to prison she <unk> it after he was in letters with photos to the food bank she was collecting food for a family and scamming the system all the social service agencies and <unk> in town 
 sex offenders in $ province go through an <unk> period that <unk> treatment or hard time jail so i wrote up a letter talking about how he violated the <unk> of his <unk> release along with copies of bills lists of <unk> her talking about wanting kids with him noted how she said she was putting a little extra '' into care packages and how they were screwing with prison phones to get additional time letting them know he had a gun in the home etc found the arresting officer judge crown and sent letters to them along with the city 's ice and pd 
 i was n't able to figure out which jail he went to there is a bit of bumping around the system when you first go in typically so i sent letters to the <unk> of all the <unk> as well 
 he was hopeful that he would get the treatment program in a place without <unk> he ended up doing hard time as this got to the <unk> committee : i also wrote letters to various inmates on prison <unk> sites letting people know who he was but i 'm pretty sure that never made it past the <unk> 
 she was evicted had a ban on visiting for a while presumably and had her truck where she was supposed to live repoed not my doing just her not paying the bank 
 pretty sure they broke up but she went into the shelter system and created / stole identity after identity and i was n't able to track her 
 i feel kind of bad about it but i do n't think i should 
 should have cut off the power as well but i did n't because i was an idiot and ended up paying like 2 months worth had to pay that off recently when it showed on my credit report 
 he got out years after his sentence was supposed to have been completed 
 tried to start a <unk> for a cleaning company i ensured it failed 
 and today i found a video of him using a shitty <unk> he took his <unk> grandfather 's first name and made it his last shooting guns and being a douchebag and sent it to the same folks above 
 i ended up living with my friend '' <unk> for 6 months until her girlfriend m went apeshit on me after her piece of shit son stole from me and i called the police - and decided to do an illegal eviction with one of her friends literally breaking down a wall to get into my room when my friend refused to give her the key to my room - and <unk> my shit outside as it was <unk> and then calling the cops and <unk> on me repeatedly saying that i was going to kill myself in an effort to get me committed and ensure that my things would be destroyed by the weather they also called my parents wtf - this was a few days after i came out to my dad as being <unk> and while this did n't out me it was n't great either as it 's one thing to have the talk '' and the other to see my whole wardrobe on a lawn 
 it also <unk> his <unk> towards <unk> people and would later bring up this incident over and over 
 <unk> and m split up within a week or two and another friend of mine j showed up a week later and <unk> wtf 
 <unk> and j hooked up and got married a few years back although i could never trust <unk> again and that relationship ended 
 even though she did hold that key from her partner and clearly put her relationship at risk doing so i just could n't forgive especially as i only found out about what she did months after it had happened 
 i 'm broken <unk> 
 m fell into some really deep <unk> and fell off the map added me years later on facebook and tried to apologize i never responded 
 did n't do anything to her probably should have 
 i learned not to associate with human garbage 
 i spent years <unk> depressed full of self <unk> wanting to die and attempting suicide a bunch of times 
 never fuck with someone who has spent decades in hell because we 're used to it and we can drag you down and just sit there and smile while holding onto you as you desperately try to claw at the fucking walls to escape 
 that said it 's been a decade and continuing feels kind of ... sick 
 certainly not <unk> more routine 
 this will probably be the last <unk> happened about 10 years ago i had just started college and i had gone to a 4 year college about 4 hours away from my hometown where 90 % of my friends still lived most of them had another year of high school left 
 among this group of friends was a girl who we will call <unk> 
 <unk> was the biggest drama queen gossip and over all terrible human being 
 she was the popular '' girl who hung out with our group of lame arts kids so that she would ensure that 1. she was always the most cool 
 and 2. she made sure everyone knew that they should feel grateful she would hang out with us 
 i never bought into <unk> 's crap and i could see through her however my friends were a loyal bunch and were blinded by her nobody would listen to me when i said hey shes causing drama we need to drop her '' 
 i realized i had to be sneaky ... so i was in my first semester of college and a bit <unk> i called my friends back home one friday night to find out what they were all up to this was the early days of facebook so it was n't open to high <unk> just yet 
 i called my friend and who answered her phone 
 <unk> 
 when she did she told me that i was in college now and that i should move on '' and that my friends were done with me i had it 
 i <unk> her on myspace and sent her anonymous mean messages pretended to be dudes online and got her to admit to her life secrets gossip about our friends then i compiled it all into one big folder 
 i came home for christmas break and even though i was n't invited to her families <unk> christmas <unk> rich people 
 i ended up going as a friends plus one i walked in with a present for the white <unk> and the gift was the folder 
 i knew i wanted my friend lets call her <unk> to be the one to get my folder so of course i <unk> all night as to how great my gift was so that <unk> would want it 
 <unk> was <unk> 's best friend '' and the one that <unk> had talked the most shit on 
 sure enough my plan worked 
 <unk> opened the present the envelope gave me a confused look and then really noticed what was in the folder 
 she passed it along to everyone and everyone got up and walked out of the christmas party apologized to me for not believing that she was <unk> 
 she became a social outcast not only did word spread about our friends but her cheerleader friends etc all stopped speaking to her 
 to this day if someone new is introduced to the group i warn them that if they mess with my friends i will destroy them they look at me in disbelief and i say just ask <unk> 
 whose <unk> '' 
 exactly 
 <unk> <unk> : ** total subscribers : <unk> subreddit rank : <unk> subreddit growth & amp <unk> : my uncle screwed my dad out of a good bit of money 
 he was also pretty much a drunk and an asshole all the time 
 for some reason most of the extended family took up with my uncle instead of my dad because my uncle had a high profile job and made a lot of money 
 so we just avoided my uncle as much as possible ... many years later i am looking for a job and apply for an entry level position at a big <unk> that has to do with natural gas 
 my best friends dad is the ceo for this company so i figured i was a <unk> 
 unfortunately this is where my uncle has his <unk> job in upper management 
 so the ceo tells me that i would n't be able to work there since a close relative is in upper management 
 so i say in passing '' well keep my resume on file 
 he is a raging alcoholic and i am sure he 'll be fired eventually '' 
 two months later i get call to come in for an interview 
 i get the job and start work 
 my uncle was fired from his job and his life immediately went to shit 
 his wife divorced him and took him for almost everything he was worth 
 she also took got custody of his two sons who <unk> the hell out of him 
 he lost his giant house to the bank after he even tried to set it on fire to claim insurance money 
 now he is jobless and alone 
 he 's constantly in and out of jail due to duis and unpaid child support 
 now my family sees what a giant ass hat he really is ... and maybe my passing statement did n't get him fired but i like to think that i was the one who knocked the first domino over to bring his life <unk> down around him 
 i get a <unk> justice boner every time i pass him in his shitty car that is his last remaining possession 
 okay this is n't my revenge 
 this is my dads 
 <unk> background <unk> my dad works as some <unk> up project manager for a water company 
 he 's worked in a couple of places all water related from general now down to smaller companies 
 started in the council / big water company which hires smaller companies which hire smaller companies to do their work etc etc 
 right now he 's in the 2nd <unk> so to speak 
 what that basically means is because he 's worked in the <unk> <unk> he 's got connections - and is <unk> 
 friends hire people they know etc etc 
 he 's a <unk> name 
 <unk> the set up <unk> in his new role he 's working on a contract his old company set hiring another company to help fill the works load / <unk> gap 
 this is why this revenge works 
 they just started work with this newly hired company - started last week 
 the boss '' of that company / team is a man by the name of <unk> something i 'll just use smith for this story 
 anyway <unk> smith needs to suck up to my dad because the success of his company relies on getting more jobs 
 <unk> smith 's workers are n't that many 
 they 've all been put forward to my dad name 's pictures and all 
 they also have company <unk> <unk> with their company name on the side 
 <unk> the <unk> <unk> my dad was driving on a saturday with my mum and cousins one cousin is about 8-10 years old to the <unk> 
 there 's a three lane road which <unk> to a two 
 my dad is driving in the middle lane where the left lane <unk> in 
 well up comes this <unk> driving in excess of the speed limit by a large margin as my dad tells it <unk> my dad illegal and dangerous and cutting him up as the lane ends 
 well my dad is none too pleased 
 opening his window giving the <unk> driver a piece of his mind how dangerous what he 's done is how stupid it was etc etc 
 well mr. <unk> is not in the wrong - so he thinks - giving out the insults of his own how he can do what he wants and where my dad can shove it etc 
 well here it gets interesting 
 my dad <unk> the driver 
 now he 's <unk> an hours drive from work my dad drives an hour every day to work and the work site - near his house and this construction worker is also <unk> an hours drive away from where they would normally meet 
 what are the <unk> right 
 well anyway my dad <unk> the company name too he 's got to be the guy 
 so my dad starts shouting do you know <unk> smith 
 do you know <unk> smith '' 
 over and over again 
 this guy seems completely oblivious to what my dad is saying while he tries to <unk> it with his own insults 
 they drive on and part ways 
 it seems like the <unk> is also going to the <unk> but changes his mind 
 <unk> the start of mr. <unk> end <unk> before they walk from the car to the <unk> my dad has called <unk> smith on a saturday left a message explaining the situation if this is how dangerous he acts on the road i ca n't expect him to act safely on my <unk> '' etc etc with the end : if you do n't call me back do n't bother coming to work on monday '' 
 boom 
 that 's a huge source of revenue lost for a company because of one guy cutting up a random on the road and words can spread in a close industry 
 very quickly 
 well not 30 minutes later my dad has an email from <unk> smith <unk> and safety very important to us yadda yadda yadda we take this very seriously yadda <unk> yadda will definitely look into it 
 i wish i could have been there when mr. <unk> got the call 
 did you cut up someone just now in a company <unk> '' 
 no ... '' well my boss the project manager for our new contract said you just cut him up '' 
 well i might 've got into an <unk> with some guy <unk> '' oh for fucks sake '' etc etc the chewing out would 've been glorious 
 <unk> the aftermath <unk> monday morning <unk> smith is in my dads office apologizing on his knees 
 mr. <unk> is not going to be seen this week got to keep his head down for a while he 's a good worker but he needs to learn the effect of his actions etc etc handed a reprimand does it again he 's out etc etc 
 well he 's on my dad 's radar now as someone to make life hell for 
 before midday my dad has a personal email from mr <unk> apologizing profusely for what he did how he was going to drop his wife off to her broken down car or some equal cop out how he 's very sorry and how it does n't reflect on his work ethic 
 all this <unk> goodness 
 after telling the story at the dinner table my dad said well you 've got ta take the <unk> do n't you '' 
 <unk> tl dr : guy cuts up dad 
 guys boss just started working for dad 
 dad recognized guy 
 calls guys boss - on a saturday - threatens to drop business 
 guy 's walking into work on monday with a <unk> <unk> a significant hit to the pride and a serious wrist slap that you would n't want following you <unk> used to have a friend who was a bit of a <unk> 
 he bought a shotgun sold it to a friend stole it back and sold it to another friend 
 he broke into people 's houses <unk> and lifted stuff at parties 
 we met in high school became friends and even though i knew him i trusted him 
 he was two timing these two girls 
 one of them had a new roomie named <unk> names have been <unk> to protect the guilty 
 one day <unk> 's <unk> bag disappears 
 <unk> was relatively new to town 
 he had some kids he 'd lost when he split with his ex 
 in his <unk> bag he had all of his pictures of his children all of his money his clothes and his gun 
 he was enraged and hurt at the theft 
 <unk> and his friends suspected everyone 
 he did everything he could think of to have his property returned 
 he accused and threatened his room mate hope 
 chased kids out of parties 
 it was a huge deal for him 
 hope moved back east 
 some innocent kids lost all of their friends 
 <unk> never caught on that my friend <unk> had stolen his bag 
 <unk> did n't get along with his father a convicted rapist who was married to a mcdonald 's manager 
 he was getting kicked out all of the time 
 one weekend my parents were out of town 
 they told me not to have anyone over and i invited <unk> 
 in the months that followed that weekend it became clear that things were missing from my house 
 my headphones were gone as well as my dad 's cellphone etc 
 it took longer than it should have for me to put 2 and 2 together 
 while my parents suspected that i had stolen from them i started to realize the extent of the missing items their size ... hmmm 
 <unk> was kicked out again and found <unk> at a friend 's house the brothers <unk> and dick 
 we had all been close friends for a long time but they jumped immediately to the correct conclusion when their rent money <unk> 
 <unk> was kicked out 
 they were pissed 
 he was denying it i did n't believe it could be him 
 we still hung out but <unk> ran high 
 one night following this recent theft a party was happening and we were all going to go 
 we were all at <unk> and dick 's house <unk> too waiting for them to finally break free of crowd <unk> and begin to move in the direction of this party 
 we had too many people for one car so i brought <unk> on my bike 
 he requested we stop by the parking lot where his car was parked so he could change 
 in the parking lot <unk> gets into an argument with one of the passengers of his car 
 it was taking a while so i drove off for the party with <unk> after he changed 
 that night <unk> 's car was broken into 
 everything he owned was taken from that car 
 he blamed <unk> and dick 
 they denied it 
 a few months later one of my friends confessed to me that they had stolen <unk> 's stuff 
 the realized they had made the right call when they found some of their missing things in with his possessions 
 that is when i realized that <unk> had no <unk> 
 he had done the same thing to my family 
 <unk> ended over these events and <unk> disappeared from our lives 
 <unk> and dick did not find their rent money 
 but they had no doubt who had taken it 
 they had their revenge 
 i had not had mine 
 after much thought i decided what to do 
 <unk> had been in town for years now 
 he had developed into a fine <unk> thug whom virtually nobody in their right mind would cross 
 he was in a gang 
 not the high school type 
 he had <unk> ink all over and was well known 
 one day i ran into <unk> 
 i had called hope back east and let her know that <unk> had stolen <unk> 's bag 
 she was grateful for the closure but forgave him 
 <unk> was grateful for the closure as well <unk> for <unk> he 'd hurt and curious what <unk> 's last name was 
 i was as helpful as i could be 
 little by little the stories started to come to me 
 they had chased him out of a couple <unk> he worked at 
 he lost those jobs because he was too scared to return 
 i do n't know what all happened to <unk> 
 but i do know payback 's a <unk> a <unk> i have never truly been in a fight and i tend to deal with most situations by <unk> and talking to the other party 
 rarely do i get personal or take things personally 
 but there was one kid 
 this one fucking kid who i actually let a grudge <unk> against 
 <unk> the fact that he pissed all over my collection of magic cards while we were drinking or the <unk> demeanor he always had about him despite the fact he was also one of the most bigoted people i know who just happened to always wear bob <unk> gear and <unk> clothing while <unk> peace and love but being a rich scumbag 
 <unk> the fact that he tried hooking up with my ex the day he heard we broke up 
 all my hatred for this dude culminated into a vengeance plot over a simple facebook conversation 
 the whole background is much too <unk> to explain in full 
 his status made an <unk> joke someone said they did n't get it and i replied to that dude using what i thought was a funny context to draw the joke in 
 <unk> head went off on me for this but really in the end what inspired my hatred to reach its <unk> was when he called me a retard a word i 'm very sensitive with as a person who has lived his life with a <unk> disorder and worked very hard to become a functioning human being its only the word retard '' when used in the context to belittle a person that i get upset sometimes 
 at the time i was <unk> an education in chemistry which i later dropped in <unk> of other interests 
 so i had access to <unk> and other basic chemicals 
 now if you do a lot of drugs you might have heard of certain <unk> you can use to test for <unk> like the <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> like these do n't just turn a single color in the presence of a single <unk> 
 i made some <unk> myself using a <unk> <unk> of 30 % <unk> and <unk> <unk> acid 
 i made about 8 <unk> of it and in the middle of the night i traveled up the dirt road to his house parking at the bottom and dumped it all over his car not knowing if it would even do anything at all 
 i do n't know whats in those <unk> and <unk> but whatever it was got fucked up 
 he worked at a local pizza shop downtown and behind it was his car 
 his car went from a dark <unk> black to a bright <unk> so i was in 8th grade when this happened and everyone in 8th grade gets a locker 
 this being middle school everyone was an immature douchebag 
 there was one <unk> pair of kids in particular who picked on people including me 
 i was the smart kid during this time making me a prime target for the <unk> <unk> 
 i 'll call them <unk> and <unk> <unk> was shorter than me maybe <unk> '' and w was about <unk> '' 
 <unk> thought he was the coolest guy in school and claims to do <unk> drugs as a way to improve his street cred '' 
 w is a big guy but is basically a <unk> 
 he ca n't really exist independently from other people and is essentially around to hit stuff 
 <unk> and w used to be my friends in fact during the beginning of the school year but they turned out pretty bad 
 what they did to me was called the locker slam 
 every day after school got out all the classes rush like a herd of <unk> towards the lockers to grab their stuff and gtfo as soon as possible 
 on most days the <unk> couple would come up to me while i was staring at the wall and my locker and slam it closed forcing me to manually <unk> the combination 
 this was annoying and <unk> for me but i put up with it almost half the year before i snapped 
 i am not a violent man 
 i do n't like hurting people 
 however on this particular occasion i completely lost all my <unk> regarding violence as they decide to step up their bullying scheme and take it up a level 
 here 's what went down : i 'm getting my books out of my locker and have my head partially inside when the bullying bunch come up onto me 
 i do n't hear them as the locker door <unk> me from most sounds not behind or to the left of me 
 <unk> <unk> me forward and steps back allowing w to slam the locker shut on my exposed head 
 by this point the hallway has mostly cleared and there are no teachers present to witness this 
 there are a couple kids however 
 the door smashes into me with the force of an <unk> giant 's arms and i fall <unk> 
 they burst out laughing 
 i lie in there for about 20 seconds and then come back to my senses such as they were 
 i stand up <unk> out blood having bit my <unk> and look <unk> square in the eye 
 he goes white 
 i punch him in the balls and he doubles over i 'll deal with him later 
 i turn to <unk> he already has his massive fist drawn back and is ready to show me twelve colors of pain 
 i dodge the stupidly predictable punch duck down <unk> up again after he <unk> his fist and kick him in the stomach 
 he gasps some of his breath driven out and i take the opportunity to bring him down with my body weight 
 he lands on his back and i give him the good ol <unk> into the stomach again and kick his nuts for good measure 
 w <unk> up and i eye <unk> again as he 's still <unk> over 
 stop <unk> <unk> or i will destroy your balls '' 
 he <unk> nods 
 i walk out the door and go home feeling like i had just <unk> over the gods ... and then the adrenaline wore off and i realized what i had just done to them 
 i instantly felt terrible 
 i did n't apologize to <unk> or <unk> i also did n't want to and so lose face and the protection i had just gained by beating the <unk> out of them 
 by the end of the year we reached a sort of mutual agreement to forget it all and the next year we were great friends 
 it worked out great for us because neither of us could go snitch with a teacher without getting in trouble ourselves 
 tl dr : the <unk> pest and his <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> by an <unk> <unk> happened a few years ago on my first trip to british colombia 
 my brother and i rented a mustang for our trip up to see <unk> in the <unk> 
 if any of you remember the sea to sky highway when it was basically a mountain highway with two lanes <unk> around up and <unk> slow if you have an <unk> in front of you <unk> up the <unk> waiting for a passing lane to open up 
 i was 25 years old in a mustang with my brother on vacation 
 we 're having a blast leading a group of maybe a dozen cars with the top down 
 i 'm leading at about 10-15 km/h over the limit being <unk> of the roads all the cars are leaving <unk> and we 're peaceful 
 my brother first alerted me to this <unk> suv driver pulling insane blind passes and hearing other drivers honk 
 he 's cutting people off in corners to squeeze back into <unk> to avoid <unk> 
 i 'm feeling the <unk> of other drivers 
 we 're all moving along peacefully with space when someone has to come along and ruin it 
 i notice now he 's about three cars behind me when i <unk> the plan 
 i decide once he 's behind me he 'll stay there as i 'll just gas up right after each <unk> to toy with him a bit and i eventually did 
 a passing lane in <unk> this point i have n't seen any police on the roads and thought i 'll have a little fun for the other drivers <unk> and of course my own 
 each time he would <unk> out to pass i 'd just gas up and give myself 2-3 bus <unk> 'll catch <unk> corner do it all over again 
 he 's throwing up his <unk> me the <unk> my <unk> lane in <unk> created a <unk> gap going into the passing lane 
 get over to the right lane doing 40 km/h over the limit with cruise control on 
 at about the <unk> mark left of the passing lane <unk> over i see him flying up easily twice the limit and i was going to just slow down and allow him to pass <unk> 'm checking my blind spot thinking why has n't he passed me yet when i notice a police officer on the other side of the road crossed the highway to point him off 
 <unk> got a massive speeding ticket i <unk> 
 i was high on life after that 
 two other drivers that probably fell victim to his stupidity gave me a thumbs up once we were in <unk> 
 tl dr : fuck with other drivers on the road in a dangerous <unk> will fuck with you 
 <unk> gets the attention of police 
 i get two thumbs up from other drivers who witnessed what went <unk> 'll start by saying i 've been considering this for some time 
 in my personal opinion if i 'm going to read a <unk> post i do n't want to have to open another window or be dragged away from my current one 
 a lot of the stories posted here have been links to r/pettyrevenge and what i 'm <unk> would just be that if you 're going to link to a <unk> post on another subreddit where there is no need to to link to just copy and <unk> the story rather than making the reader have to load a new page 
 links would be fine if it was to a news story picture comment thread etc. this would only make it so that text posts that have no need to be linked would stay here rather than <unk> the reader 
 i 'd like to know what you guys think so please comment on this or message me directly 
 i 'll make a decision after hearing what you all have to <unk> 'll start off by saying it is n't exactly revenge against my ex but it involves her 
 a couple years ago i was dating this girl that i loved 
 we had been together for about two years despite multiple incidents in which i found out she cheated 
 i know i 'm an idiot for staying with her but whatever 
 we broke up eventually and i was devastated inside 
 about 2-3 days after the <unk> my dad and i get into a huge fight 
 long story short i get <unk> and end up moving out the next day 
 as i 'm living away from my parents i get texts from my ex 's new boyfriend saying that if i kept talking to her he was going to beat my ass blah blah blah 
 keep in mind we broke up because i found out she blew me off to hang out with the guy she was currently with 
 so back to the story i tell him that if that was how he felt than he knew where i lived and he could come by to settle it 
 his reply to that : well you 're ugly '' 
 that 's what you say when you 're called out 
 a few months pass and i 'm back living with my parents 
 my ex texts me one day and wants to come hang out 
 she 's still dating this guy so i agree 
 she comes over and one things lead to another and we end up bumping <unk> 
 but before we start she suggests we record it on her phone 
 i 'll never know to this day whether he ever found the video or not but the satisfaction i felt inside was wonderful 
 tl dr - you call me ugly i fuck your girlfriend 
 and record <unk> all love prorevenge and reading your great stories but as the sub has grown to over 20,000 the number of posts has n't significantly grown 
 as an attempt to add more content to the sub starting today we will be allowing links to be posted for the next two weeks 
 this is only a trial and we wo n't make a final decision until the trial period is over 
 while we realize quality is often better than quantity we also think there are some really good stories out there from other sources 
 some people have pasted stories here and while that 's fine it 's also a hassle and we feel there are a number of reasons allowing links could be <unk> 
 for the trial period all posts will be allowed - pictures news stories <unk> etc 
 but if we do decide to allow links when this is over we may limit what is allowed 
 we care about your feedback so please comment in this post or message the mods your feelings on this new trial 
 we want what 's best for the users so we care about what you all want 
 just as a friendly reminder please still follow the rules and be polite to each other 
 also please never post personal information and never ask for information 
 thank <unk> is something i did in 9th grade 
 i had a friend <unk> who was one grade older than me 
 we were friends through most of elementary and jr high but when we got to high school and i was a freshman and he was a sophomore he decided to start picking on me 
 we had a math class together that required us to keep a folder for extra credit 
 we could choose one homework assignment and one <unk> every week to put in the folder the teacher then based how much extra credit we got by the grades of the assignments you put in the folder 
 one day about week before grades were due i pretended i was putting assignments in my folder but really i took <unk> 's folder and emptied it 
 the next week our teacher asked <unk> why his folder was empty 
 <unk> could n't figure it out and spent all class looking for the missing assignments 
 i started to feel bad cuz he looked like he wanted to cry 
 he had already failed the class last year and really needed the extra credit to pass this year 
 i was torn between feeling bad and trying not to laugh and give myself away 
 eventually our teacher told him to stop looking and learn to be responsible 
 he had to work his ass off the rest of the semester to pass 
 i wonder what became of him ... ... <unk> wanted to be a cop ... please do n't kill me but i was wondering what and why the division is between /r/pettyrevenge and /r/prorevenge 
 is there some awesome backstory i 'm missing out on during my freshman year of middle school i got the nickname <unk> after the god of <unk> in <unk> <unk> and exactly how i got the name i will explain now 
 at the beginning of the year i was a loner no friends absolutely no social life i got bullied a fair amount but then there was this kid ... who we shall call george who was the definition of a <unk> no intelligence good at sports needs nerds '' to do homework for him because he could n't comprehend math 
 he started to pick on me and throughout 2 months it turned to bullying 
 this continued for another 3 months when i have had enough 
 i go home one day furious and decide that i 'm going to take this bastard down 
 i realized i was n't strong enough to fight directly but if i could pull it off i could fight him indirectly 
 so for 2 days it was the weekend i began to plan 
 i cut holes into my jacket to act as <unk> do n't really remember what i built though by the end i had created the perfect <unk> suit 
 so on monday i put on my jacket and leave for the bus and sure enough the bastard <unk> me 
 he goes into grab me but i was prepared i quickly brought my <unk> to my palm which released a set of <unk> on the floor and then i slowly walked back 
 the bastard slips and falls but gets up quickly and charges for me 
 so i quickly start running and i feel something on my right arm a toy spider smiling i turn around and throw it at him he freaks out and begins to run and then slips on the <unk> and smashes his head against the sidewalk he lived 
 okay maybe the perfect suit was a lie it was mostly filled with stuff like <unk> toy bugs some glue and a water gun but to 12 year old me it was <unk> perfect 
 <unk> : i brought down bully using <unk> and a toy <unk> you need to link to a news story picture etc. that is fine this is only so that the reader does n't get ripped away from their current page because the op was too lazy to copy and <unk> a self post story 
 this will not affect links posted prior to this 
 if your post <unk> the new rule it will be taken down until it 's fixed 
 if you saw something on reddit or some other website and you 're not sure if posting a link to it <unk> the new rule feel free to message the mods to ask 
 thank you to everyone who gave their opinion for this new rule and thank you everyone for your <unk> radio 's <unk> that features revenge as part of their program 
 you may have to do a word search for revenge 
 many <unk> <unk> ago i used to live in a small town in north carolina 
 i was in the fourth grade just as happy as can be 
 i was a generally quiet kid and got along well with pretty much everyone 
 i was the <unk> good '' kid that everyone loved 
 one day while playing soccer at recess one of the kids shoved me down kicked me in my stomach <unk> kicked the ball 
 now this kid was barely a stranger to me 
 i do n't remember ever talking with him let alone having any issues with him nor him me 
 i think in my <unk> memory of <unk> he may have been in a different grade ... so when he did this besides being physically hurt i was confused as to why someone would to such a thing to me on purpose 
 after a visit to the nurses office and going back home nothing came of this situation for a couple weeks 
 well one day i was sitting outside with my girlfriend <unk> ... young love waiting for my oldest sister to pick me up 
 i do n't remember why we were n't riding home on the <unk> this day but it does n't really matter ... as me and my girlfriend you always remember your first love right 
 were just sitting there talking that same kid from before approaches us and starts calling us names and at one point called my girlfriend a whore 
 now i was a pretty sheltered kid at this time and some of those names were foreign to me but my sense of honor demanded that i stand up for my girlfriend i never cared if someone called me names even at that age 
 so i started off running after the little <unk> 
 well he was quite a bit faster and more <unk> than i was and so easily <unk> all my attempts to ... do whatever my young mind was going to do to him 
 after a while he eventually got tired of running around me and waited for <unk> only to kick me as hard as he could in my <unk> 
 again back to the nurses office with a phone call to my parents about what had happened etc etc but to my knowledge nothing happened to that kid 
 closer to the end of the year we were out playing soccer again and i saw that same kid 
 well this time i was n't going to just let him be 
 i waited until he had the ball and then instead of kicking it to get it away from him kicked him in the knee 
 hard 
 somehow and to the best of my knowledge my girlfriend was the only one who saw it 
 i never got in trouble and i never saw him again either 
 i like to think that i might have broken his <unk> brother has been <unk> for eight out of 20 years of his marriage possibly more 
 he has also been reckless with his <unk> <unk> in nearly $ <unk> which our parents had to pay to bail him out 
 he only had one son who was <unk> and disabled all his life and died a couple years ago in his teens 
 after the latest and hopefully the last <unk> in <unk> last year we discovered his <unk> <unk> which led to his wife leaving his house to crash at my other brother 's place until she could figure out how to be independent again 
 the police was also brought into the picture by getting him and the <unk> to appear in front of someone of authority to <unk> them to stop <unk> in this <unk> 
 yeah that 's something we do in our country 
 when the <unk> finally made the appearance she <unk> <unk> are you threatening me '' 
 to us as if nothing was <unk> <unk> about their relationship whatsoever 
 later mr. <unk> here apologized and swore he would be a totally different man and begged for the wife to come back 
 she refused 
 meanwhile he lost his job dad 's business fired him and thus was unable to afford the house dad 's business <unk> 
 he moved in with our parents and i was tasked to <unk> <unk> 
 i <unk> took pity thinking that he misses his wife and would do everything to get her back 
 i could n't have been more wrong 
 he continued to <unk> us that he had cut all contact with the <unk> when in fact he was still adamant on paying her grocery phone and <unk> of other expenses 
 i then set up a nice fat keylogger on the pc he was using promptly took over his and her facebook and gmail accounts 
 <unk> her naked pictures to 27 of her favorites friends along with extended proof of their thousands of <unk> worth <unk> while my sister-in-law was taking care of his disabled child at home 24/7 
 i then took over her <unk> account and proceeded to brick the iphone 6 plus my brother had so <unk> gifted her 
 she did manage to recover her email address but i had completely <unk> her facebook and <unk> accounts from it 
 facebook was then deleted 
 they are still together 
 hey <unk> i just wanted to say how excited we are to have over a thousand <unk> 
 we 've been a community for about a month and already created a network with <unk> and <unk> see sidebar for <unk> 
 we are also happy to already have a number of great posts already 
 we hope to get even more <unk> soon and become even bigger as well as get even more great stories 
 thanks to everyone here for <unk> and sharing our sub around reddit my friend knew this girl in high school 
 he was mad about her 
 after graduating life sent them on separate <unk> 
 love and regret : after about 20 years they got in touch again after meeting at the high school <unk> 
 memories were <unk> 
 sparks flew again : one and many things lead to another and he moves across states to be with her 
 he moves in and they are happy 
 after a couple of months he notices that she would have these massive mood swings from happy to anger to <unk> to cruelty 
 a completely different person 
 he notices that her ex-husband would come around a lot 
 we 're just friends '' 
 was her explanation 
 one day he spots her computer email open and reads emails between the ex and her about having sex when my buddy was n't around 
 she would say he just left 
 <unk> on over 
 lets fuck '' 
 and he 's just here to pay the rent '' 
 and he 's and idiot '' 
 he reads her replies and <unk> to guys all over the country on craig 's list cruising for sex 
 he prints out all the emails and <unk> them to the fiancee of the ex-husband 
 she received them on <unk> <unk> 
 by then my buddy has moved out 
 on the <unk> his ex calls many times but he <unk> n't answer 
 she did finally send one more text saying you just ruined christmas '' 
 a year later he meets a beautiful girl that he had known before and they got married and are very very happy 
 my dad told me this story about a guy he used to work with 
 my dad 's coworker grew up in a rural area 
 he lived next to this old white trash douchenozzle who was a huge alcoholic 
 one day the family dog was found shot to death in their back yard <unk> the prick 's property 
 they had had issues with the guy before this but nothing close to this bad 
 they confronted him about it and he pretty much told them all to go to hell 
 well this guy and his brothers had had enough of this bullshit and decided to get back at him 
 they knew the guy went into town to get drunk every weekend and came back late to pass out 
 they waited until he got back one saturday night from the bar in the summer and snuck over to his truck 
 they got into the truck and popped the hood 
 they laid some roadkill a rotten <unk> <unk> on the hot engine block and closed the hood 
 that <unk> sat in there through the whole hot summer day <unk> until the guy had to go into town and noticed the stench 
 he probably never got the smell out 
 back story : many years a worked in a care <unk> and had the opportunity to do the <unk> administrator in training program with the small company 
 it was a year long paid program where i kept my regular accounting job with them at the same time 
 at the end of the program i thought i would be given a <unk> of my own with them but one of the head <unk> big cheese senior vp of the company did n't like me 
 i found out it was because the lady i was working under had tried to become an administrator and had failed the national exam 3 times and complained to big cheese about me many times for bogus stuff 
 i was fired a month after i received my <unk> 's license and big cheese that did n't like me said : <unk> will never be an administrator for us shortly afterwards i was offered a great job with another company at a really good salary 
 i also got a 2 month severance package because i wrote a letter to the company president and told him that as a licensed administrator in that small state i would like to be able to say positive things about his small company they had about 8 nursing homes 
 i worked for the new company for about 4 years running a <unk> <unk> 
 we had great <unk> great reviews and made good money 
 i had a good friend that continued to work for the other company and he would occasionally mention in meetings with the head <unk> how well i was doing 
 my revenge : i was <unk> away to another state by another company with a large salary offer but it was a crap company and i put the word out with <unk> and others that i was looking 
 lo and behold i get called by the president of my old company that they would like to interview me for an <unk> 's position at their <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 so i agreed to the interview and had them fly me almost 1000 miles rent me a car i picked a new mustang put me up in a nice hotel for 2 nights for the interview 
 i take advantage of that by visiting relatives putting tons of miles on the rental going <unk> great <unk> in that area and had a great time 
 did the interview and they offer me the job 
 i tell them i would think about it 
 i went home and accepted another offer that i knew was coming one that i was going to take anyway and did n't bother to call them back with my decision 
 about 2 weeks later i get a call from the president the one that gave me the severance asking about when i wanted to start work 
 i said : well you know i would love to but several years ago big cheese said that i would never be an administrator for your <unk> and i guess he was right '' 
 and i hung up 
 it was sweet 
 that company has since broken <unk> happened around <unk> when i worked for a computer company that decided to start offering web hosting 
 since the project was one of the top <unk> of our ceo he took a very <unk> interest in how his pet project was going and was very <unk> when anyone emailed him about any and all <unk> 
 while that 's usually a good thing to do for customer service it 's often not so great for the poor sales guy that gets that one customer that has issues with everything 
 so on to the <unk> i was working in my cube farm when i got a call from a <unk> young lady looking to <unk> her boss company into the information age and was looking to see what we could do to help her out 
 m - me 
 <unk> - <unk> girl for now m : hi this is <unk> how can i help you '' 
 <unk> : i need web hosting for my company 's website and i 'm not sure where to begin '' m : you 've come to the right place let 's see what we can do to help '' so that 's probably not the exact wording but i do always try to be helpful to my customers so that 's the general <unk> of the start of the conversation 
 we went on to talk about our <unk> how things work the pricing and a lot of other <unk> & amp a. in all it took about <unk> minutes to get everything sorted out and make her a happy camper when we ended the call this is called <unk> 
 she said she needed to make a couple more calls and then give everything to her boss but i should hear from her in a day or so 
 fast forward a couple of days and i had n't heard from her so i figured i 'd give her a call and find out if she was ready to go 
 i actually got her on the first call rare for sales and at that point we 'll just call her <unk> for <unk> girl because nothing that came out of her mouth during this conversation was nearly as pleasant as our initial call 
 at first i thought i 'd actually gotten her evil twin but then came to the conclusion that this was in fact the same person just on a different frequency 
 apparently after calling us she called a <unk> who proceeded to tell her all sorts of <unk> information which she <unk> upon me 
 <unk> : i spoke to your <unk> and he told me a ton of lies i do n't remember what all she said but i think he got our name right 
 other than that it was pretty much all false '' m : & lt tries to <unk> said lies & gt <unk> : he said you 'd try to say that but i know better i guess his lies were <unk> than my truth 
 no idea i have a very pleasant phone voice i guess his was just better m : i 'm sorry you feel that way but i 'd be happy to go over everything and make sure you have a clear picture of what you 're getting from both companies and clear up any <unk> if i can '' <unk> : & lt nothing vulgar was said but nothing <unk> at this point either 
 i believe she did cast some <unk> upon my <unk> and perhaps my <unk> 
 at this point we were pretty much done & gt m : if there 's anything we can do for you please let me know '' <unk> : & lt click & gt about 10 minutes later i get an email in my box from the <unk> that i had been copied on 
 i also realized that it was directed to my ceo who i was certain was going to read it 
 it contained a <unk> of my <unk> my <unk> my lack of ability to tell the truth and quite possibly my severe lack of <unk> none of which was true especially the stinky part 
 i did n't realize how fast our ceo would read that but by the time i was through reading this sternly <unk> <unk> my manager was popping out of his <unk> like he been shot from a gun 
 he got an email my director got one and both of them wanted to know what the hell i was doing 
 fortunately i had a great rep on the floor and a couple of awards for being a customer advocate so i was n't <unk> up on a stake to serve as an example for the rest of the staff 
 it did however take a bit of telling the tale and swearing on an unopened copy of <unk> windows to convince them that i was n't even half as horrible as i was <unk> in this work of fiction 
 now the revenge part 
 upon arriving to work that morning i got a lovely piece of spam in my mailbox 
 all i had to do to get all of the <unk> <unk> hardcore porn delivered to me daily was just give them my email address 
 since this was before the canned spam act there was n't any of that <unk> <unk> thing so with just a couple of clicks of a mouse i made sure she was fully informed on every <unk> of every sexual position and <unk> anyone could send her for free even what a bargain 
 not only had she emailed me from her corporate address she even copied her home email so she could keep a copy of the <unk> down she gave me presumably so she could cheer herself up by reading it when she could n't find anybody in the office to have fired 
 not wanting her to miss out on her education into the ways of the world if she was n't at work i added that address too 
 i 'm not exactly what <unk> at that point but knowing the wild west of porn spam at that time i always rest assured that her email boxes were <unk> and <unk> and then <unk> some more because once they had an address even an act of god would n't get you off of it 
 throwaway for obvious reasons 
 so we had this kid lets call him <unk> cause he is staying in our home for 2-3 months rent free 
 my roommate who owns the house has a really big heart and i also think likes drama and so has these boys stay over to get back up on their feet 
 well most of them fuck off and do n't get jobs or even try sometimes are rude take food that is n't theirs etc 
 but i digress my roommate has a big heart so he kinda lets people walk on him 
 so <unk> we were pretty sure was stealing prescription pills from my roommates mother she is like a walking <unk> and needs her medication 
 so it had gotten to the point where we were tired of giving him chances and kicked him out 
 last i had seen of him i was told he should n't be around i threatened to get my gun because i assumed he was trespassing 
 well last weekend for some reason my roommate let <unk> stay the night because i guess he had no where to go on the terms that he left early 
 well he was hanging out longer than needed but eventually left 
 then i find out one of my roommates other couch kids caught <unk> in roomies room straight up taking change and money out of his jar and acted like he did n't even do it 
 then tuesday night about 30 mins after my bf goes to work i hear the fence next to my room banging around 
 i assumed it was a dog trying to get out we had one that would escape all the time 
 so i open my curtain and there is <unk> looking straight at me breaking into our yard to steal stuff 
 i was n't thinking i just wanted to get him and so ran in the the house to the backyard but i think he hopped back over the fence and ran off 
 i yelled to my roomie in the shed out back its like the trailer park boys 11 <unk> live here we have <unk> everywhere if she had a friend upstairs cause sometimes they 'll hop the fence to visit her 
 i told her <unk> was in our yard and to grab her bat 
 i go downstairs and inform the other couch kid to grab his bat and we search the block for him yelling that if we see his face we 're gon na smash it 
 so we lock everything up for the night and are on our toes if he tries to come back 
 now wednesday night i go to work come home hang out pass out 
 wake up the next day and my roomies are <unk> me he was back last night and was in stuff 
 one of our friends unaware of the situation had let him spent the night but had issues getting him to leave the next morning so my roomies went over with <unk> to get him out of the house 
 then they noticed that he had stolen objects on him like headphones he had to bust into one of our cars for a cd he had to of gone through my shed roomies stuff for etc 
 once i hear this i think oh no 
 i had just got out of the shower and had to be to work at <unk> i run into my bus and check my drawer where i keep my savings 
 $ 100 gone 
 i fell to the ground and started bawling i was so angry 
 i knew i should have locked my stuff up better after seeing him trying to break into our stuff 
 i run inside and tell everyone what he did 
 but the guy is a dumbass 
 they found an ad he posted on cl he even took a picture it was taken in the house of the friend they went and kicked him out of 
 he 's looking for a girl 
 so my roommate messages him and talks to him pretending to be a girl and to meet <unk> in the park 
 i had to go to work upset that was all of my money 
 well like i said we have 11 <unk> in our house 
 5 or 6 of them went and they all stood at the exits in groups of two 
 the girls even walked up right behind him and waited while he sat on the bench waiting for the girl that was never going to come 
 my bf is a scary looking guy tattoos and <unk> on his face strong big <unk> has guns knows how to use them etc 
 he was a fucking retard to even go into our bus and steal from us 
 so he 's sitting there i guess and then he sees my bf coming at him from across the park so he goes to get up and run but the girls are behind him 
 they both just push him down and start punching him 
 one of my newer <unk> comes over now and picks him up and knocks him down again with a punch 
 then picks him up 
 at this point my bf is running at him and just takes a flying punch at his face knocking him on the ground again 
 at this point he is on the ground crying like a bitch while getting boots in his face 
 finally my roomie who owns the house gets there and is <unk> on top of him screaming into his face how fucking stupid he is for stealing from us when we let him into our home 
 the whole time while my bf is grabbing his head and shaking him and yelling at him for fucking with his gf 
 then one of the girls says he has a knife in his pocket 
 my bf grabs it and throws it away to <unk> him 
 we did everything legal no weapons 
 only a <unk> could be <unk> for kicking the shit out of him but what is he gon na say oh i got the shit kicked out of me because i was stealing from these people multiple times '' then my bf notices that is his knife that was in the same drawer as my money 
 also keep in mind this kid is trying to say he did n't take anything from us when we have caught him red handed and he also had the stuff on him 
 at this point people thought it was over for him they thought my bf was going to kill him but my bf did n't even pull the knife on him but i 'm sure the kid almost pissed his pants thinking he was about to die 
 they emptied his pockets and while they are taking stuff he has the nerve to be like hey thats mine '' 
 he only had $ 25 in his wallet and my bfs like mine now '' 
 at first we took his nice phone and bus pass but my bf said to show a little <unk> and gave it back 
 we told him to get the fuck out of town or we wo n't hold back next time 
 my bf wanted to cut his clothes off and make him walk around naked but that would be illegal 
 he got boots to the face ... he cried like a bitch 
 i do n't think he will ever mess with us again 
 i only got $ 10 of my money and he bought some fucking spice fake weed and <unk> with my money 
 i recognized the price tags they were from a porn store across the street from the house 
 i took the <unk> i smoke it sometimes 
 but yea ... fuck that <unk> looking at all the bullies stories over reddit the past few days reminded me of some stuff i did myself in 5th grade or so around that time i was somewhat <unk> and the 1st one in my class to get <unk> 
 my parents made me wear that <unk> for the extra <unk> look as well : now some people did not like me for wearing them 
 they really did not like me for wearing them it was usually verbal but 2 guys got physical when i kept ignoring their verbal <unk> why do schools recommend <unk> instead of revenge god knows 
 anyways they had been randomly pushing me around pulling my chair away etc for a few days well it was time to get even 
 even though i did not look too strong i had enough to muster up a few strong punches and <unk> 
 but i couldnt take on 2 of them 
 so i needed to get them down 1 by 1. dealt with one by skipping a <unk> period stealing some stuff from the teachers desk and a few of the students the teacher loved and <unk> it into this guys bag 
 well when class started a search happened and that got rid of this guy for a few days didnt have a plan for the 2nd one but i had some sort of an <unk> coming up soon 
 where the school principal would have been present 
 <unk> this guy about 5 <unk> min <unk> she turned up kept him off me barely him him hard once to get him pissed and as soon as he started <unk> i got all <unk> as if i had been beaten badly 
 thats when she walked in as well 
 the consequences of that were fun to watch it kicked off a series of events that led to the guy being held back a year in 5th grade back in the early 90 's i went on a camping trip with a bunch of friends and a younger friend of a friend had invited his high school buddies who were a bunch of <unk> <unk> 
 that night around the <unk> the <unk> are <unk> drunk and fighting each other occasionally and making a hell of a mess 
 the next morning my friends and i were up earlier than them and collected all the trash into bags 
 when they woke up we asked them if they 'd be willing to take just one bag with them to dispose of it most of it was cans from their <unk> they 'd brought 
 they laughed and said they did n't give a fuck and they were n't taking any trash 
 while they were distracted we put all the bags of trash in their trunk as the little bit of camping stuff they has was still in their back seat 
 perhaps not the most satisfying revenge but they probably had quite a stench in the car after a week or so 
 my history teacher told me this story a week or two ago 
 i do n't know if this is true or what the final outcome was but we can all hope 
 so as we all know driving drunk is very dangerous for the driver and anyone around them 
 the driver of one car was drunk probably over the speed limit by an absurd amount etc 
 as is essentially cliche at this point she hit another person <unk> while the sober driver died soon after 
 she was caught and arrested i do n't know the legal system <unk> cetera so i may be wrong with some of the stuff in this paragraph 
 when she was brought to court she settled out by being required to keep a picture of the guy she killed in her wallet to be checked by her probation officer every meeting 
 the picture the mother of the dead guy chose a picture that would force the woman to remember what she has done for the rest of her life : a picture of the guy in his coffin 
 **tl dr : drunk driver kills someone and must carry the picture of him in his coffin for the rest of their life 
 ** to anyone who think this is n't a kind of pro revenge : think of how it would affect you mentally to be reminded daily that it 's your fault that someone 's son and possible father and/or husband was killed when it was <unk> 
 have a <unk> <unk> 
 tl dr a man <unk> wrong number but is rudely hung up on 
 angry grudge against guy number <unk> 
 different guy cuts off our main character when he tries to park so main character uses this opportunity to get revenge on not one but two assholes

 i was recently working this one <unk> contracting job making decent money 
 we had an opening and i 'm trying to come up with people who would actually be good for the position and would stay long term 
 i talk to a person who i used to work with at another company who i find out is actually looking for a new job lives in the middle of nowhere and has turned his life around from being a big time drug user to being a born again christian 
 because of his born again status and because i knew he had the skill set we need i help get him hired 
 all i ask in return is that he gives me a gift certificate at amazon because he ca n't buy me lunch anytime soon living in <unk> 
 well 2 years have past 
 i left for another job that had full benefits 
 he was promoted to supervisor at the old job 
 it 's been interesting watching him on fb : 1. he 's thrown away all his <unk> music 
 not donate it <unk> it away 
 ** 2. he 's gotten heavily into guns and <unk> them regularly 
 3. he 's gotten into buying various <unk> of <unk> 
 yet no gift certificate even though i 've gently reminded him about it once or twice 
 unfortunately the contract he was working on has recently ended and now he 's looking for a new job 
 my company have plenty of job <unk> and he even asked me to help <unk> his resume along 
 i said to him '' remember how i helped you get the last job 
 remember that gift certificate you kept promising me you send me 
 exactly why should i help you now '' 
 his response was to <unk> me on facebook 
 how <unk> of him 
 : - this happened a couple of years ago 
 in the area i live in it 's not uncommon to see <unk> flags in front of businesses especially car dealerships 
 it 's also common here to see the <unk> flag hung alongside mexican flags and i 've even seen it buried in a whole array of flags from south america 
 while it 's great for a car dealership to display their pride in <unk> i feel <unk> our flag this way <unk> it 's <unk> 
 so on my way to work one day i was delighted to see a car dealership that had american flags clipped to every car and hanging on the fence in front were two larger flags and not a foreign flag to be seen 
 it was a mom and pop place with a dirt parking lot with a trailer office in the back and about 10 or 15 used cars on the lot 
 i 'll call the owner dealership guy <unk> 
 my excitement was <unk> because as over the next few weeks i would drive by and sometimes either one or both of the larger flags had come off of the <unk> and were lying on the ground or had been pushed down on the <unk> so that they were flying half <unk> or at the bottom of the <unk> but they were usually fixed rather quickly so i just blew it off 
 one morning i was driving by with my wife and as usual my eyes went to the flags and i shouted <unk> is that flag hanging upside down ** '' 
 my wife told me to calm down and either email or call them when i get to work and ask them to fix it 
 when i got to work i found the dealership 's website and an email address to which i sent the following email : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : thursday july 30 2009 <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> *what is the problem with the american flags in front of your business 
 * <unk> i 've passed by your office this week the flags are either on the ground <unk> <unk> upside down 
 as a veteran who has made <unk> for his country i find this * <unk> of respect for a <unk> of those <unk> made by me and many others offensive 
 this* <unk> of attention to detail <unk> on you and your business and i will never buy <unk> <unk> who can not pay <unk> to something as simple as proper respect for <unk> <unk> flag and will even go to great lengths to ensure that my friends and <unk> *do not shop there either 
 * <unk> you * <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i attached a copy of the flag etiquette code with the parts <unk> that deals with the flag touching the ground flying at half <unk> and being hung upside down 
 a little while later i got the following reply : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <unk> : <unk> to : <unk> <unk> : thursday july 30 2009 <unk> <unk> <unk> : re : <unk> *i will rather ignore or no respond to your comment 
 i am not the wind that blew it off 
 * <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- to which i replied : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : thursday july 30 2009 <unk> <unk> <unk> : re : <unk> <unk> you the wind who hung it back upside down 
 not once but at least <unk> <unk> week 
 * <unk> the wind keeps blowing them off please secure so that they ca n't come loose 
 * <unk> piece of wire a couple of screws or some duct tape should do the trick 
 * <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- when i did n't get reply and i figured the guy was probably just embarrassed and would go out an fix it right away so no big deal 
 but on the way home i saw the the flag was still upside down 
 the next day i stopped on my way home and took pictures being very careful to say on the easement <unk> of the business and not to touch the flag as that could be seen as trespassing and possibly get me thrown in jail 
 over the next couple of days i talked to the local police emailed the local <unk> and american <unk> 
 i more or less learned that its within his right to display the flags in whatever manner he wants no matter how offensive it may be 
 that started me thinking he may have the right to <unk> the flag and hang it upside down but i have the right to call attention to it as loudly as i can 
 his website did n't have a comment section or one of those <unk> meters so that was out 
 it was <unk> on one of those places that lets you set up your own website for free so the closest i could get to his website was to create my own 
 i created a web page called dealership guy <unk> is <unk> '' 
 i posted the pictures of the flags with a story about what was going on and i set up a counter of the number of days that the flag remained upside down and a daily blog to update the story that went something like : drove by there this morning flag still upside down '' 
 drove by this evening flag still upside down the other one is at half <unk> '' 
 3 days and still no reply from dealership guy '' 
 then i went to every forum i could think of that was appropriate and posted <unk> <unk> is <unk> '' with the story and pictures of the flags 
 i emailed the local radio stations and tv stations 
 to top it off i joined a couple of online biker groups and posted in there ... those guys love their flag 
 after waiting a couple of days i did a google search and sure enough all of those posts my website and a few cross posts popped up at the very top of the search 
 a search on yahoo gave me the same results 
 i took screenshots of the search pages and sent them to dealership guy i included the <unk> of the google and yahoo search pages and the <unk> of my web page i <unk> it with a very sweet * '' have a nice day : '' * 
 after several days of silence and being ignored i got a reply within minutes 
 i could bore you with a whole tale about <unk> physical threats and threats of a lawsuit or how the local media came this close to getting involved but to make a long story short he took the flags down completely immediately after i sent him the email 
 not exactly what i wanted but no flag at all is better than a <unk> one 
 girl i was with gave me the <unk> 
 i found out she was sleeping around on me <unk> it came out that the <unk> was going around in my social circle 
 so we all go get checked and get meds 
 they all get <unk> 
 i 'm still pissed that 1 she was sleeping around on me and 2 she gave me the <unk> 
 so i do n't take my meds for 3 weeks and as expected she comes to me wanting some 
 so i gave it to her <unk> and all 
 took my meds and laughed my ass off as the <unk> made its second rounds through my social circle so i 've been browsing this subreddit for maybe an hour or so and i think it would be <unk> if you could add <unk> into your title so i know if there are some 
 when there are pictures that provide <unk> info it 's very <unk> let 's start with some backstory 
 as a <unk> hobby i plant a lot of <unk> in my backyard 
 probably around <unk> types of <unk> 
 my <unk> has a lot of space so i 'm sure my neighbor felt justified in taking <unk> <unk> from my garden each day since i 'd never noticed '' 
 but luckily i have a fancy security system outside and caught him in the act 
 this bastard was done 
 instead of confronting him directly i wanted to see him burn 
 so i scout out his backyard and decide to fuck around with him 
 i steal his water hose grill basketball goal <unk> flowers outdoor table set etc 
 i put them all in my pickup truck while he was out of town one day and drove the fuck off and dumped them into the forest 
 f that <unk> mid 90s ... story of revenge by one of my closest friends 
 adam worked in a <unk> factory for gm 
 one of adam 's co-workers let 's call him bill thought it would be funny to give his co-workers ex-lax during a shift 
 bill goes up to adam and offers a piece of chocolate but adam was operating a machine with both hands 
 adam said break off a piece and put it in his mouth 
 the shift goes on 
 after adam figured out what happened he learned about 4 others in the plant were also <unk> 
 bill did n't think this prank through ... he cost co-workers sick time and some of these co-workers had kids and bills to pay without paid sick days 
 turns out bill was banging a welfare mom mom b and living with her at the time but she was n't reporting that <unk> mate 
 adam was also banging a welfare mom mom a 
 adam told mom a what happened 
 she knew the welfare system well enough to call mom b and pose as someone from the investigation department of social services 
 mom a basically said that the department is aware of her having someone live there and not reporting the situation to her case worker 
 the investigator mom a said if you come in and discuss this with the department we will not pursue fraudulent action 
 tl dr : do n't be an asshole with <unk> when i was 15 i got a job working at a breakfast restaurant 
 i did n't really like it compared to my summer job but i wanted to make money during the school year so my choices are limited 
 my boss paid me below minimum wage but the bus boys would get a very small <unk> of the <unk> 's tips 
 after that i would usually end up getting paid around $ <unk> an hour but i always felt it was kind of <unk> because the <unk> would make at least $ 150 in tips and because i knew my boss was quite well off because he drove a nice car his son drove a nice car and his daughter that i went to school with drove a nice car 
 now the money that would <unk> for my wage was called tip share '' and i would pick up the previous day 's tip share after each shift 
 at first i would always get paid what my tip share was or rounded to the next dollar 
 as time went on though things got more <unk> 
 our boss started <unk> <unk> where ever he could and i got yelled at once because i was throwing away still wrapped straws that were still on the table 
 ok fine these straws literally cost less than a penny each and it 's more trouble that it 's worth to save them but whatever i did it anyways because i was told to 
 i then noticed that i would get <unk> a few <unk> on my tip share though 
 for example if my tip share was $ <unk> i would only get $ <unk> 
 this started to <unk> me for obvious reasons but i did n't say anything about it 
 it got worse though 
 one day my tip share was something like $ <unk> and i only got $ 23 
 i then said my tip share is $ <unk> '' but then the manager giving me my tip share quickly walked out of the room while saying oh sorry i do n't have <unk> <unk> '' 
 after that even if the tip share was a few <unk> short i would stick it to them and make them pay it 
 the first time i did this to my boss he made me feel like i was begging for change 
 this went back and forth until i eventually got sick of it and quit 
 i felt so defeated and hopeless 
 that 's when i discovered <unk> though 
 for those of you who do n't know trip advisor is a website that is open for anyone to leave a review on a restaurant attraction etc 
 this restaurant i worked for was in the top ten out of 300 restaurant in my city so you could say it was pretty highly <unk> 
 this is where my revenge starts to take shape 
 i realize that creating an account and posting one bad review with my new account will accomplish nothing 
 i needed a reputation or <unk> 
 i created 30 different accounts and i started to slowly building up <unk> 
 with these 30 different accounts i made fake reviews some good some bad i only did bad reviews on other places where the general <unk> was that they sucked and it took me a year or two to make everything seem normal and i <unk> the amount of reviews each account made 
 by this time my boss had actually <unk> and had a second restaurant in a different location of the same name 
 i wrecked <unk> on both of them leaving around 15 1-2 star reviews on each restaurant 
 after i did this more 1-2 star reviews started showing up that i did n't even write 
 the <unk> restaurant that my boss opened up ended up closing down and out of curiosity i went by the restaurant that was still open in a sunday morning 
 the restaurant was a breakfast place so sunday morning was the busiest day of the week because everyone would go out to eat after church 
 it was nearly dead 
 i counted 4 cars in the parking lot 
 i do n't think i 've ever felt more satisfied in my whole <unk> few months ago a guy we 'll call alex embarrassed me in a club by mocking me and almost punched me for no reason 
 alex is a connected though guy 
 another person in this story is harry 
 harry is an older guy a known <unk> and a larger than life character 
 via facebook he posts a lot of stuff about himself and his friends or enemies he does n't care what people say about him and he 's afraid of no one 
 recently harry has revealed some embarrassing facts about alex 's dad and he was legally threatened because of it but harry does n't care and continues to post information about alex 's dad 
 i 've created a facebook account and i am threatening harry but i am not saying who i am however i am leaving bits of information that would suggest i am alex and i am furious at harry that he embarrassed my father 
 harry replied to me a few times saying things like i know who you are if i meet you i 'll smack <unk> '' 
 so there it is i hope alex gets a well deserved <unk> start off i do n't consider revenge a <unk> form of action and a more <unk> resolution should always be attempted first if not a few times but at some point revenge is <unk> right 
 or more fun your <unk> so here 's my story 
 a few years ago in college i managed to get my first internship for engineering 
 i wont say where i was hired but it was a <unk> plant of a sort 
 needless to say i was quite green to the field and young but excited 
 several interns were hired but my position was different 
 while all the other interns were put in the engineering offices i was put in a small office on the floor with some <unk> supervisors none of whom where even in my field 
 <unk> before you read on please note that i ended my <unk> on a great note 
 i had saved the company thousands more a year than it cost to have me there implemented a new product procedure stunned management at my presentations and even left with an informal job offer <unk> 
 i was essentially thrown to the dogs to learn <unk> that no one in the plant knew all the steps to and i had 3 days to learn them from the past intern all while trying to attend <unk> <unk> i ended up writing a 12 page paper on how to perform that one duty 
 due to all this mess i managed to get myself put into the engineering office but i had missed all the getting to know you '' events with the engineers due to my responsibilities getting back on track my supervisor was a young guy who started as an engineering intern and after graduation went through a fast track program to become the department supervisor 
 now in comes <unk> name changed my manager had informed me to ignore her requests and has been in obvious <unk> with her but he out ranked her and for most arguments was typically in the right 
 she hated him 
 remember the responsibilities '' i mentioned earlier 
 well they required me an intern mind you to light a fire under the engineer 's butts to get them to push paperwork through 
 this created a mild animosity from the engineering department towards my intern position and me especially from <unk> who was notorious to the floor supervisors for not only being a jerk '' but never doing her paperwork 
 she was also notorious for talking behind peoples backs etc etc 
 i was given a new engineering supervisor and when my new desk was placed in her area she immediately assumed that i was there to do her work and that she could make me miserable 
 during the first few weeks i had no issues helping her out and learning as much as i could i frequently asked her if she needed help but then it became abusive ... im not sure if it was that i had to pester her to do her job when i had my old responsibilities '' or that i did n't take peoples <unk> % when they just wanted to <unk> % on someone or that she had a bad relationship with my supervisor who <unk> her 
 either way she started talking behind my back to the other interns when i was n't there 
 i was informed that she would get off the phone with me when i was on the floor doing her job and <unk> her head back <unk> out loud how i do n't do any work 
 she would talk down to me and treat me like i was stupid simply because i would ask her how she wanted me to do the tasks she requested 
 i was given a many tasks that were <unk> by other interns and were <unk> forward but once completed she would yell at me for not doing them how she wanted 
 i was given many tasks with no instructions or a lack of important details just so she could complain that i was doing things wrong 
 doing her job wrong 
 the breaking point was when i had a month left of my <unk> 
 another intern left a month early so that she could secretly start a different internship she claimed she went to summer school 
 the desk i was given in the engineering department was so tiny that i had to use spare tables in other rooms to keep all my work in order so i requested to take the other interns large desk and my supervisor approved 
 after watching me run around the building after i had <unk> out to get all my things on the new desk and have everything set up <unk> did n't say a word 
 the next day i came in to an email from her telling me i was out of line to move my things without her consent mind you she had no authority over me and was one of 20 engineers in the office and told me to move my things back 
 i went to my supervisor and asked what the issue was but <unk> had already yelled numerous lies about my desk <unk> and i was forced back to what people had dubbed the lonely island '' 
 that very same day <unk> had the <unk> to bring me to her desk and explain she had was in charge of a new product and that i needed to come in 2 hours early for the rest of my <unk> to over see its <unk> and record its data 
 she stressed it 's <unk> for her and that this was my '' way of making things up to her 
 i had my opening 
 i agreed and started coming in early but missing '' my data points 
 at first i did n't directly mess up her data but i didnt try very hard either 
 eventually some of her <unk> got lost in a mess of literally thousands of others due to the <unk> not paying attention i sure as hell did n't check the logs to find them 
 then the last week i was there i over heard her <unk> up her new product how great it was and how shes really been helping <unk> learn what engineering really is '' and she took me under her wing '' when in reality she had n't talked to me for weeks 
 at this point all my data went missing 
 the backup file was corrupt and after she presented my presentation as her own she was swiftly taken to the head of engineering 's office and much noise ensued 
 i apologize if this was long and <unk> but i still left out many many details of the <unk> things she did to me 
 another one off the top of my mind is that she invited all the interns except for me to many after work <unk> and even talked about it in front of me 
 when i was in senior year of high school there was n't much to do in my area 
 so me and my indian friend would go play <unk> 
 it was fun and passed the time 
 so anyway one time we were playing and we got to the hole you had to hit a ball up the hill 
 i hated that hole because you rarely hit it with the right amount of force 
 so i hit my ball and it starts going up 
 when it reaches the top of the hill a freak of nature happens and it somehow goes flying right up in the air 
 <unk> '' 
 immediately i hear behind me an angry hey '' 
 i turn around and see a middle age guy stomping towards me from the other side of the course 
 what the hell are you doing 
 you 're gon na hurt somebody '' chill out man it was an accident '' no it was n't 
 you two are being freaking idiots and are gon na hurt someone '' i look over at my friend a scrawny <unk> 17 yr old kid who could n't do shit if he tried and me a <unk> kid who literally just tapped a <unk> ball up the hill 
 we looked at each other questioning if this was really happening and if this guy was serious 
 you idiots stop messing around and dont <unk> your balls in the air '' he starts stomping off 
 but i did n't mean to '' he looks back at me stomping off with rage face 
 turns out he was just playing with his kid 
 my friend and i go to the next hole 
 hey <unk> the dudes <unk> at you '' 
 just ignore him '' 
 we played the hole 
 next hole i saw he was doing it <unk> 
 * i had enough and knew he was fucked if he laid a hand on me so i waved at him and yelled with a smile how you doing '' 
 the guy <unk> in shock 
 the problem was my friend did that to him everytime we got to a new hole 
 i told him to stop but i stopped caring 
 at the second to last hole <unk> finally responded good '' 
 and stomped back up to us and stood right next to *me* as i <unk> 
 i began to purposefully miss my ball and knock it into the wall next to him 
 oops '' 
 i did it around 10 times and finally sunk it when he finally walked away 
 i looked at my indian friend and told him alright the <unk> is thrown 
 follow my lead keep your shades on and no matter what happens do n't 
 fucking 
 laugh '' 
 that friend was a real racist 
 i stopped hanging out with him because of it but i used it to his advantage 
 i should mention this was the spring after <unk> 
 we went to the cashier and talked to the manager 
 with my most pathetic soft voice i began to tell her what happened to my friend and i. how the guy approached us and yelled how he harassed us and how he targeted my friend 
 you know we come here to have a safe fun time and this guy ... this guy was so racist 
 he ... he called my friend an <unk> <unk> '' 
 my friends face immediately turned red trying to contain his laughter 
 i could tell his eyes were <unk> behind his shades 
 i mean look at him 
 he 's clearly embarrassed and turning red 
 he 's not even <unk> he 's indian 
 and he blamed him for <unk> '' 
 the manager looked crushed boys i 'm gon na talk to him right now wait here '' no look we had enough today we 'll come back another time 
 we do n't want him to yell at us anymore '' 
 we left the building and i told my friend do n't laugh till we got in my car 
 the split second before he closed his car door we heard <unk> yell what '' 
 and we lost it 
 we drove off into the <unk> 
 victorious 
 tldr dude fucked with my <unk> 
 i called him racist 
 <unk> <unk> i was heading home from university early in the morning after <unk> summer class not a nice morning driver 
 the main road to the university that is normally packed during the school year is under construction which meant 3 lanes became 1 for a good 2 miles to and from the university 
 as i head into the <unk> i see that some chick in a suv was trying to cut me off but i supposedly had the right of way cause the front of my car was in front of hers and i was in the <unk> lane 
 this continues for like <unk> mile because this <unk> was quite long and i try to maintain being in front of her she without warning starts to <unk> left onto my lane with me there knowing that i was there so i had no choice but to go into the center lane left turning lane until this dumb bitch passed me and i could <unk> back in i had a smaller car so she would have won the fight 
 kicker is when i <unk> back in she flipped me the finger and shit was going to go down because i felt i was being generous to not have our sides fucked up 
 as we passed the construction and the road went back into 3 lanes she immediately goes back to the middle lane and i <unk> it passed her and cut her off as close as possible as soon as my front tires <unk> the front of her car since i was driving faster than her 
 i then slammed on my brakes all the way to 0 mph flipped her off 
 as i felt <unk> i started to <unk> but was n't really ready to let her off just yet 
 she switched lanes again thinking this is over and that <unk> would restore 
 wrong 
 i did it again 
 now she <unk> at me and tries to escape by switching lanes again 
 wrong 
 third times a <unk> 
 now she is probably freaked out me as well because normally i would leave it at flipping them off as a drove past freaking blood rush 
 she pulls into the nearest parking lot on the right and i go on my merry way feeling quite accomplished 
 again i acknowledge that i have road rage issues 
 tl dr <unk> chick forces me into the middle left turning lane in a construction <unk> point and has the audacity to flip me off triple revenge back to back 
 do n't fuck with me on the road 
 <unk> it 's not my first revenge but the first i can remember myself 
 everyone knows how little kids are amused by the crowd of adults 
 kids show off make silly things etc 
 it was n't my case 
 i was always interested in adults because of the things they were talking about which i did n't understand and what they were able to do which i could n't 
 *** my brother had a group of friends which occasionally were hanging out in his room 
 i 'd always just wanted to sit and <unk> 
 i remember guys touching their girlfriends kissing etc 
 all this behavior i could n't wrap my head around 
 another example was one of the guys who could spin the basketball on his finger 
 actually i still do n't know how to do it 
 all of this was just amazing kind of like a different world 
 *** sometimes my brother was letting me sit there and usually they were making fun of me 
 i was the only one who was n't laughing since i did n't know what they are laughing about 
 they were asking me things like <unk> tell us what is vagina '' 
 vagina 
 i asked and they burst out laughing 
 or they were asking me to tell them a joke and i was telling them a joke i heard from someone my age and they were just rolling over not because the joke was any funny but because of the situation and they way i was telling it 
 *** one day my brother brought his friends and i stand near his room looking at everyone like a little creep 
 one of the guys a musician brought his new girlfriend 
 i was in love 
 i had to get to that room to be able to <unk> at her but they closed the door 
 i knocked i asked i begged 
 nothing 
 my brother went to the kitchen to heat up some water and that was my moment 
 i sneaked in jumped under the table and settled <unk> 
 my brother came and started dragging me out so i hold to a table leg 
 did n't help 
 they were smoking cigarettes that why they did n't want me there 
 i even did n't care i just wanted to stare at that girl 
 unfortunately the musician could n't hold on to his girlfriend so it was the only time i saw her 
 *** i went to the kitchen and i poured about 2 <unk> of salt to the <unk> 
 my brother made coffee for a few people and soon enough they figured somethings wrong 
 he went again warned me that if i do this again i will regret cleaned the <unk> and started making the water again 
 a week back i got prescription from a doctor because i had n't <unk> for almost a week 
 none of the over the counter stuff worked so he prescribed something serious 
 it sure cleaned my <unk> pretty damn good 
 i spent whole day glued to a toilet 
 i found the pills crushed them with this thing saw my mom using it and poured to the water again 
 well i took 1 <unk> and i poured all of them to water probably 9 left so imagine for someone without the problem 
 all 4 people who were drinking coffee including my brother next day were dying 
 their symptoms were <unk> blows runs flu dump 
 my brother himself sounded more like a machine gun 
 *** i had n't told that to my brother for over 20 years until yesterday 
 we had such a blast during the dinner i almost peed 
 good old times - *** *** tl dr^ older brother gets punished by providing him and his friends a <unk> of their life and he does n't know about if for over 20 years well reddit this all happened a couple of years ago before <unk> quit drinking 
 well drunk <unk> was quite the fellow 
 he was rude crude and a petty revenge kind of guy 
 one day young <unk> came in to work and was presented some samples of <unk> sauce for the upcoming <unk> at the local event centre 
 well <unk> popped the first sample into his mouth and it was a delicious <unk> <unk> sauce 
 now before i continue a <unk> young fellow with a <unk> for <unk> people and being a general douche had started a few weeks earlier 
 everyone called him by his last name : <unk> 
 <unk> called him <unk> 
 <unk> did not like his <unk> in the least bit 
 in fact <unk> was <unk> to his <unk> that he began to break a little inside each time he was forced into a social situation with <unk> 
 anyways enough <unk> 
 the second sample was supposed to be another <unk> sauce but this one was supposed to be the <unk> of the two 
 in fact the cooks specifically <unk> had been <unk> this <unk> since the first <unk> of the sun 's <unk> were reflected off the door to the basement bar he worked in 
 when <unk> put the sample in his mouth for a second it tasted quite nice 
 a spicy <unk> sauce heavy <unk> of something all together not unfamiliar to our hero 
 then the <unk> <unk> was an old beloved of <unk> but this was unlike anything our friend had ever experienced 
 it was flooding his <unk> and tear <unk> 
 his every ounce of being began to <unk> with the <unk> <unk> he had just <unk> 
 the entire kitchen as well as the bartender and <unk> at the <unk> of the whole ordeal 
 the bartender informed our <unk> that <unk> and the rest of the cooks had gotten their hands on some ghost pepper extract and made it into a <unk> of a sauce that was to be used on drunk people ordering suicide <unk> 
 the bartender hardly able to contain his laughter <unk> a 2 <unk> container of milk into <unk> 's hands and so he <unk> the <unk> juice at an incredible rate almost finishing the container ... then a moment <unk> <unk> was dancing around with <unk> pouring out of his <unk> cavity 
 suddenly the urge to <unk> came upon our <unk> and he <unk> for the water closet 
 at first there was relief but soon after that <unk> realized that the <unk> that was within should be kept there and processed for it <unk> the same if not more coming up 
 so our hero was forced to <unk> the contents of his stomach from the <unk> <unk> god 
 but something inside him was broken 
 something that would eat at him until vengeance had been brought to pass upon the evil <unk> 
 weeks passed 
 <unk> <unk> his time until such an event would present itself where retribution would be swift and <unk> 
 he remembered an old <unk> <unk> : revenge is a dish best served cold 
 one day while sitting at the <unk> counter after <unk> just the right amount of <unk> <unk> sat down beside <unk> 
 <unk> ordered another beer trying to ignore his most hated of enemies 
 then something unexpected happened 
 <unk> threw a <unk> canadian one dollar coin into <unk> 's beer and promptly left his drink unattended at the bar to head to the <unk> 
 <unk> saw his chance 
 it was time to put up or shut up 
 he grabbed <unk> 's beer firmly with his left hand <unk> his fly with his right hand and pulled his <unk> out and <unk> them around the full container making sure to get just the right amount of <unk> juice around the brim of the glass 
 <unk> returned from the bathroom and drank his fresh <unk> of beer none the <unk> 
 then <unk> <unk> his revenge 
 he waited until <unk> got up and left the counter and told the loud mouthed bartender on the other side of the counter what had just <unk> 
 now all <unk> had to do was wait 
 wait for the story to <unk> 
 a couple of days later <unk> was on duty and could not even look <unk> in the eye 
 he knew he had been <unk> 
 there would be no more question as to who was the bigger dog 
 a few days later <unk> terminated his <unk> with the bar 
 edit : tl dr : got tricked into <unk> a piece of chicken with ghost pepper sauce so i tea bagged the guys beer while he was in the <unk> used to work in a small <unk> type pub very local 
 this woman my boss lets call her bitch <unk> was horrible and vile to everybody staff as well as customers 
 i have never seen so many people walk out that place she was <unk> insulting peoples music taste physical <unk> most of what would not affect their work performance 
 once some customers asked if there was any <unk> to which she replied there 's a shop down the road go buy yourself some '' 
 so i was relieved when i finally got out of that <unk> 
 i wrote many terrible <unk> under different accounts on yelp trip advisor google etc 
 i rallied friends to do the same as well as spreading things by word of mouth 
 i found out after a year she lost the pub and is living in a shitty flat and working a <unk> on minimum wage 
 karma bitch it was a super <unk> day on <unk> as i was driving my <unk> <unk> <unk> home 
 up ahead there was an <unk> and the highway hangs a very sharp left just under the <unk> 
 right on my ass was a white dodge truck with three guys in the front seat 
 i tried to speed up to get them off of my ass but they persisted and i couldnt even see their headlights at one point 
 i know that this sharp turn in the highway was coming up and that there was no way my bald tires could handle the turn with this heavy <unk> so i threw on my right <unk> just before hitting the curve and allowed myself just to <unk> into the far <unk> lane 
 the white dodge was not expecting the sharp turn at his rate of speed and i watched him <unk> in my rearview mirror 
 first into the <unk> then into the car in the middle lane then into the car that was behind him 
 it was like watching a <unk> game 
 i never slowed down i just kept going 
 <unk> story begins with a friend of mine being harassed by one his mutual relations 
 we were all in high school at the time my friend his <unk> and myself - <unk> 
 it was mid summer around the time when you are at a loss for how to fill the long lazy days 
 we did the usual stuff play video games play pick up sports ask me about <unk> smoke a lot of pot ... well one afternoon me and my friend lets call him <unk> meet up to just <unk> 
 he starts to tell me about the previous night however and how this <unk> from now on known as stew of his <unk> up his car 
 when he said his car was fucked up i 'm like <unk> you drove here so obviously it was n't so bad 
 but he explained to me that during the previous night a girl he was <unk> dig out wanted him to come over and <unk> 
 now <unk> really is n't good with the girls which is no big <unk> to me but this came as a surprise to him and myself - <unk> 
 was he finally gon na get laid 
 nope 
 stew let all the air out of his tires and smeared baby food mixed with what apparently <unk> to be shit 
 it was already after midnight and <unk> did n't want to deal with his car so what was supposed to be just an annoying <unk> prank turned into <unk> 
 bam 
 fast-forward to a little later in the day and we 've already concocted a brilliant scheme to get stew back 
 we set out to go fishing 
 <unk> to you animal <unk> about what happens <unk> 
 there is this great little <unk> pond close to where we live so we decided to go there 
 we brought a nice white five gallon bucket and a lid and some beer ... .and pot 
 for some reason on this particular day we could n't miss with our <unk> 
 i 'm <unk> every other cast was just jerk n catch 
 before long we had 30 small pan fish in our bucket 
 but we knew what we needed what would really send this scheme to the pro level 
 and would n't you believe it on our next <unk> we each got one 
 two fat n <unk> <unk> ... yeah those dirty brown mud fucker fish 
 we put those in the bucket too 
 <unk> 
 we were off to the store 
 we grabbed a gallon of milk and a container of meat <unk> 
 that night we added the milk and meat <unk> to the bucket 
 already at this point if anyone got a full <unk> of the contents of that bucket they <unk> been hair back eyes out gagging 
 we covered the bucket and put a couple cinder blocks on top to keep out the local <unk> 
 but every couple of days for two weeks <unk> went out and gave that bucket a good <unk> n <unk> with his <unk> 
 after that bucket had been <unk> for two weeks we decided it was time to do the deed 
 we <unk> up in elbow gloves black plastic trash bags and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the stench 
 there was no way <unk> was bringing that bucket in the car so i held that heavy bitch out the window all the three miles to stew 's house 
 at <unk> in our <unk> <unk> suits we slipped like <unk> onto stew 's driveway 
 <unk> climbed on top of his car and <unk> for the bucket 
 with a few <unk> words he dumped the stewed contents all over the windshield and into the hood 
 stew had <unk> yes but he never retaliated against <unk> after that 
 i belong to another forum in which i have spent way too much time on 
 and it 's a website that <unk> and tries to be <unk> about whether or not <unk> can actually <unk> the laws of physics and if <unk> <unk> can actually fight people then answer to both is no 
 among other <unk> retarded claims made by several martial arts or artists 
 i 'm also the most successful and <unk> <unk> on the site having caused multiple <unk> in social structure and policy development by generally being as much of a calculated asshole as possible 
 any member of this site will know who i am 
 the owner of the site has once said to me in private you are the fuckwit that we need but not the one we deserve '' 
 anyway there was a particularly annoying user who would constantly try to piss on anything i did 
 i made it a point to be extra mean to him in the worst ways possible 
 i would go beyond the call of duty to make sure that he would get the full extent of being as <unk> as possible 
 i would use sentences such as this is why your mom left you '' 
 in response to being called a faggot '' and a <unk> '' 
 or i 'd go into my bag of <unk> and do things like send him a private message that had images takes from the <unk> <unk> in full resolution now this might not mean much but at the time the forum did n't <unk> your images so they 'd be displayed full bore on your screen 
 this kid had a shitty computer and so such large images would crash his computer 
 i figured out a way to get past the signature size limits on images as well so i would make <unk> images my signature on every post to him so he 'd crash out 
 anyway this back and forth would go on for about 2 years or so until i made my way across the country to formally train '' with him 
 we did some <unk> in which i submitted him in <unk> <unk> ways 
 wrist locks shin <unk> rode him like a <unk> making <unk> <unk> noises while he <unk> to get out from under me or just calling out my <unk> a few moves before i would do them 
 to be fair he was n't very good at <unk> as he said 
 he said he was much better at kick <unk> 
 so he wanted to do that instead 
 i agreed to the terms and we had 3 - 2 minute rounds 
 the video is lost somewhere but i have a single still from it <unk> i collapse his <unk> 
 here 
 at some point i punch him in the face so hard while sticking him in the corner that his head whips back and hits the camera 
 i think i also broke his foot at some point 
 i do n't remember exactly when or where but he claims that i did 
 i 'll take it 
 i left pretty satisfied and he stopped being such a little piece of shit 
 it was worth <unk> 3000 miles and having built up the <unk> of kicking the shit out of him for roughly 2 years 
 4 years ago i quit working as a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> coffee house we 'll call super <unk> 
 i had a number of petty wins while i was there but this is my only pro revenge 
 the boss at super <unk> is a horrible <unk> 
 there 's a lot to keep track of so smaller things will get tasked to the lowly employees - one being keeping inventory of coffee <unk> 
 while the job was n't the best the coffee is fantastic 
 i 'd never steal while i was working for the business but once i left that went out the window 
 my buddy who 's still working there has been throwing me about a pound of my favourite coffee every 2 weeks since i left 
 just a few shy of <unk> of coffee <unk> swiped to <unk> was a kid so please do n't judge for my actions 
 as a kid i was a <unk> 
 i was everywhere and if something happened i was the first on the suspect list 
 either it was making fire in a trash container <unk> something to neighbors dogs throwing small rocks in neighbors windows at night stealing <unk> from their <unk> putting mud on their cars and more 
 i was chased many times by the neighbors and usually they could n't catch me since i knew exactly where i can sneak thru where they wo n't 
 however my parents were going crazy 
 the story takes time when i 'm 8. i have been hanging out with jack the son the the current town clerk in a very small city 
 the new <unk> was coming up 
 *you also have to know that i come from a <unk> country 
 as some of you may imagine something like today 's russia <unk> people 's values and beliefs about how the things should be '' 
 it 's not like in the story any more but still my country is in the ice age in some matters 
 * *** another day me and jack got caught us on stealing <unk> 
 near our residential block were many small <unk> where most of the people had apple trees <unk> <unk> etc 
 many people were making some goodies for the winter 
 and everyone knew the best cherry tree in the whole area 
 we sure knew too 
 jack was a kind of a chicken and it took me some <unk> to make him go with me 
 after all i was running faster - we got caught and the owner took us to our parents 
 no one was home at my place and the owner used to so much to what i was doing that he just warned me 
 like 10th time this year 
 jack on the other had got in some serious trouble 
 besides beating the hell out of that kid the town clerk forbidden him to hang out with me and going outside 
 i felt it 's unfair 
 <unk> we did n't do any damage it was nothing to what i did in the past he still got punished like it was something big 
 in the contrast i did n't have the <unk> for what i did 
 i felt that the responsibility of the revenge <unk> on my shoulders 
 *** next day i went to pee on the town clerk 's door 
 while i 'm peeing the door opens i 'm hiding my <unk> and sure enough the town clerk just <unk> 
 his mustache were kind of jumping and a huge vein appeared on his forehead 
 he grabbed my ear before i was able to move 
 it really hurt 
 on my toes i was walking to my apartment 
 no one is there 
 we go back to his place and he told me to sit ... in his small toilet ... like some animal 
 i supposed to wait for my parents 
 i hear the town clerk and his wife arguing 
 it was first time i saw that he is probably a monster at home 
 i closed the door from the inside and i was holding to the lock so he was n't able to open that with a screwdriver 
 i told him i want to wait for my mom 
 in the meantime when he was away from the door i took every single bottle of <unk> etc. tooth <unk> etc. which were in the cabinet over the toilet and i poured everything to the toilet 
 i was also flushing the toilet every time as it filled up to piss of mr. clerk 
 my mom got home and i made myself to cry 
 i told that mr. clerk wanted to beat me and i was scared etc 
 all of that to not get in trouble with my mom 
 she got pissed and took me home 
 i was crying a long hour just to not get beaten by my mom 
 *** now i was even more determined for the revenge 
 one day i was looking at some photos 
 there were a few pictures from the vacation with my parents and the town clerk and his wife 
 on one of the pictures the clerk was with my father 
 the town clerk was holding his hand on my dad 's stomach and both were laughing probably drunk as fuck just fyi they were wearing these which is still normal for straight people in my country lol 
 i took the picture and cut out my father 's head 
 found an envelope and got my neighbor friend involved who was about 5 years older since i was n't very good with writing yet 
 we wrote a letter which said that the town clerk is a gay and we attached the proof '' 
 being a gay in <unk> country could mean literally death 
 by people who like trouble or even police believe it or not that 's truth 
 for sure it would be extreme <unk> to these days 
 the least when proven would be <unk> from the society even family 
 btw 
 the short swimming shorts does n't mean in <unk> countries that you 're gay ... so i went to the post office and i say i want to send the letter to the towns clerk office 
 there is nothing on the envelope 
 a very nice lady was laughing at me since it totally looked like i do n't know what i 'm doing 
 she did n't know the address but she was kind enough to make a call and write it for me on the envelope 
 she asked me what is my name and being surprised by that question i gave a name of my friend from school 
 so now she said $ 2 dollars example 
 i was like what 
 money 
 i do n't have money 
 and how much 
 well 
 now i had to get money somehow 
 i got home and asked my mom for money 
 she asked me why and i lied i want to send a letter to <unk> <unk> 
 she was surprised by that but she gave me the money 
 i run back to the post office ... and it 's closed 
 i will have to wait until monday then 
 *** it was really really hard to not spend this money 
 but the mission was more important 
 the letter was sent 
 i do n't know what i was expecting but probably something like they will arrest mr. town clerk '' and he will spend 10 years in a jail 
 well nothing happened until ... *** the town clerk did n't win the new <unk> 
 a few years later i heard a story when he was starting again for a new <unk> that a few years back someone accused him of some <unk> acts and it bent his reputation 
 accusation in the office was enough to start the rumor around the small town 
 since the letter was addressed to the clerk 's office not directly to him i 'm guessing someone opened it before he did 
 as a kid i did n't really think that sending the letter directly to him would not cause any damage 
 still i think it was clever during the new <unk> some kids sprayed in some places in town mr. clerk is gay '' it was n't me 
 for everyone it was obvious that the last name was the clerk 's name 
 he won that <unk> however 
 years after when i look at it it really tested his reputation 
 all the good things he did for the city did n't matter 
 maybe he was a bad person at home but people were saying he was a good town clerk 
 i was never asked about the picture so i guess he either have n't seen it which i doubt or he did n't want to let to know my parents if he even was able to recognize and remember the <unk> the photo was taken 
 since the incident when he closed me in his restroom our parents were n't hanging out any more 
 i saw him occasionally on something which is celebrated as namesake '' 
 it does n't exist in the us in my country it 's just another reason to get <unk> i was 8 years old it <unk> in texas for the first time since i was born 
 i was down the street having fun enjoying myself when one of these bullies that was about 16 <unk> snow into ice and threw it at my face 
 it hurt like hell and i started crying since i was so mad 
 so i went back to my house made a snow ball and peed in it 
 i used a hat to carry it in did n't pee in the hat lol 
 i went back to him and threw it right in his <unk> 'll give you guys some back story 
 in graduate school i met my girlfriend <unk> not real name 
 the best way to describe her was she was the sweet innocent indian girl to everyone but she had a really slutty side that she hid from her parents and her indian social circle 
 when we would start dating she 'd tell me that her parents expect her to get married soon that she could get married to a <unk> lawyer etc 
 she 'd talk about how she would n't have to work a day in her life 
 i do n't know if she was trying to make me jealous but i did n't give a shit 
 funny thing about the whole matter is that these guys usually expected a <unk> girl ... which <unk> was the <unk> from 
 when we started dating she told me it was just going to be a fling but over time i started <unk> serious feelings for her 
 i told her and turns out she felt the same 
 i was n't a doctor but i had a good career ahead of myself 
 i wanted to have a serious relationship and maybe one day marry her 
 later in our relationship 3 years in she told me she is going to go to florida with her friends to party see <unk> 
 as <unk> i felt about this i did my best not to come off jealous 
 she promised to text me to make things easier for me and all 
 and well she told she was going to see <unk> 
 i was talking to my friends about it turns out <unk> was in europe 
 when she came back i started confronting her with the inconsistencies and she started lying her ass off 
 though she never admitted to cheating she started doing nice things for me to get me back 
 at this point i was thinking fuck her and move on 
 but i decided to milk it for what it was worth 
 i used the whole cheating thing to have her on grade a behavior to add to that i used it to get a <unk> 
 after that i felt much less bitter but i could n't ever see myself getting married to a girl that cheated on me 
 she was a good girlfriend but i could n't risk getting divorced to her later down the road and she takes all my money 
 and since she still never admitted to cheating on me directly i did n't feel obligated to tell her that i was n't interested in getting married 
 by now we were together for 5 years i was 31 and she was <unk> her <unk> clock was <unk> hard 
 her parents at this point pretty much gave up on her getting married and her younger sister was already married and popped out her first kid 
 we got into a big fight one day and in it i yelled at her to admit that she cheated 
 and she finally did after all that time 
 i do n't know why but a huge weight just lifted off my heart that i had won 
 and then i told her that we are over 
 since then she has been begging me to <unk> 
 for her reality hit her hard 
 when it comes to traditional indian <unk> a woman past <unk> no one is really interested in 
 and sadly for her the effects of <unk> were already getting to her 
 plus she was planning to lie to her future <unk> about her sleeping around so i do n't really feel bad for her anyways 
 it 's not that she ca n't still land a guy she can still find a decent guy now but the idea of marrying a rich dude that will treat her like a <unk> <unk> is over for her 
 her life of not having to move a finger is gone now 
 that 's what you get for cheating : & lt 3 <unk> 
 when i was 13 years old i had my first job in a restaurant and i was so excited because obviously it was my first job 
 i am 20 years old now and openly gay but then i was obviously very shy and quiet and was quite the pushover 
 so anyway one night this girl and her boyfriend came in and i had to serve them and any time i spoke to them they kept laughing at me you know when you 're trying not to laugh at something with your friends but you make it really obvious 
 that 's basically how she was treating me all night long making me feel so insecure 
 so anyway for the first and only time in my life i <unk> revenge on her i had to make her <unk> 
 she had a lovely chocolate <unk> with my <unk> sticking it to the plate and some ice cream with also my <unk> in it 
 i <unk> a little bit of revenge but i did n't really feel like i had done myself justice because her boyfriend and her continued to smirk even after she ate the <unk> and i told the manager i will get revenge on that girl i promise you this '' 
 he just laughed and told me to let it go 
 well the god 's most have been looking down on how this girl had treated me with her boyfriend making me feel so insecure in my own skin at 13 because the next day after i had finished <unk> me and my friends went into the supermarket right beside it and as i was walking along the <unk> i saw a familiar face and shouted no way '' at the top of my voice 
 it was the girl from the night before 
 she looked up and i 've never seen the <unk> drain from someone 's face as quickly as hers 
 i told my friends all about what happened and they quickly went and grabbed all their food and we went to her till 
 we all started laughing and just making her feel as uncomfortable as possible 
 after i paid my money and she gave me my receipt i looked her straight in the eye and said it 's not nice being intimidated in your own work place is it '' 
 and she just hung her head in shame 
 it was glorious 
 a few years later i ended up in a & amp <unk> last month because i could n't breathe and the doctors could n't get an <unk> level 
 i was sitting in the hospital room waiting for the nurse to come when the curtain was pulled back and i heard a <unk> <unk> <unk> '' 
 i looked up 
 it was her 
 her from the restaurant her from the supermarket having to care for me 
 we both looked at each other like deer caught in the <unk> 
 we knew who we both were but we decided to say nothing 
 she obviously made her little nurse <unk> chat like what i did and stuff and she was telling me about my diagnosis but i do n't think i 've seen a nurse take blood pressure as quickly and throw my medication at me before running for my life 
 i 've had a lot of revenge on people in my life some obviously not as effective i had to have <unk> because i was bullied so much but i think this one was the best of the bunch so i was always a <unk> and i moved from out of the area to this middle school 
 it was already <unk> <unk> 
 these two boys who were twin brothers made my life absolute hell 
 called me every name in the book tried to start rumors about me the whole nine 
 one of them was definitely worse than the other but they 'd assist each other when they deemed it necessary 
 i had fought back with my own <unk> but two against one is hardly fair 
 it was n't until i had a side job in college that i was able to exact my revenge 
 i was in college and i worked as a tutor 
 i had my stoner friend with me who was <unk> 
 we drove around looking for somewhere that would <unk> his <unk> when i saw a <unk> 's sitting on the corner 
 it was a saturday around 11:30 am and i rolled up to the window 
 an all too familiar voice asks with his stupid <unk> this is <unk> 's may ah take ya order '' 
 i figured that this day was as good as any to exact my <unk> justice and i told him yes i will take 27 orders of $ 1 chicken <unk> '' 
 instant panic took over the kitchen as they were dropping <unk> and <unk> of chicken 
 my former primary bully tried to talk me out of the multiple small orders but i refused 
 this is for a class function '' i lied then continued they need to be in individual packaging for all the students '' 
 i went up to the window and paid 
 noon struck while i was sitting there and all of a <unk> <unk> started <unk> the parking lot and getting in line 
 it was soccer practice day and all of the kids had just gotten out of their morning <unk> 
 i rolled up so that they could try and process the other orders to the best of their ability 
 the bully himself walked up to my car holding several bags and stared <unk> realizing what had happened 
 thanks '' i <unk> as i <unk> the massive bags of chicken <unk> handed them to my stoner friend and drove off like a bat out of hell 
 my stoner friend probably ate at least 18 of those things 
 we gave the rest to this woman that we knew was homeless so that she could have something filling for the evening 
 it was a great day 
 whenever my friend and i talk about it we call it operation <unk> '' 
 i told this story to my fiancee who insisted i needed to share this story with other people 
 this seems a bit involved for the subreddit for petty revenge so i posted it <unk> sure if this is prorevenge or pettyrevenge so i 'm posting in both 
 so i live in an apartment complex with extremely limited parking and no parking on the street for a good half mile 
 one night i come home from doing a 12 hour job to discover the parking space closest to my apt is open 
 as i go to pull in i realize no it 's not open some <unk> tool has double parked 
 so i got ta go park in the <unk> i walk back and check his park tag they usually have the apt number on it his is <unk> off 
 so i 've no idea whose ass to kick i decided to go for the next best thing i grab a can of spray paint and paint douche across the side of his car in giant letters from window to the bottom of his doors 
 i ran out of room for the <unk> so it ended up across the windshield 
 the next morning i woke up and the car was parked proper lesson learned 
 added bonus : lesson not learned i found out who he was later because i 'd see him get up every morning for the next couple of weeks and check on his car to make sure no one messed with it meaning that he did n't think that someone sprayed his car because he was parked like a douche but because he thought someone was out to get him 
 i guess his <unk> nights still make it totally worth it 
 i am in a graduate program for <unk> chemistry and there is a class that all students in the school i am in 
 i this class there is a class mate let 's call him <unk> 
 let 's also call him dr. <unk> 
 he is a doctor because he has mentioned this several times 
 in fact every single chance he gets to let someone know he has an <unk> he says well i have an <unk> so yada yada yada '' 
 so in this class we have to present as a group about an assigned topic 
 of course i was grouped with dr. <unk> among other people mostly girls who for some reason are all over dr. <unk> 's chin if ya know what i mean we begin talking about our assigned topic which is ocean <unk> 
 dr. <unk> automatically takes control of the group 
 i try to contribute and <unk> <unk> will not let anyone get a word in edgewise well because he has an <unk> for <unk> 's sake 
 that makes him an <unk> in <unk> right 
 well no you know what does 
 a <unk> 
 in <unk> 
 to which i am one class away from receiving 
 i start arguing with dr. <unk> to which he replies perfectly i might add it 's not like you have an <unk> in this or something '' 
 which i literally do 
 before i can reply the <unk> of the class walks by aware of the program i am in and says wait <unk> me not my real name do n't you have one '' 
 <unk> 's chin along with the rest of his face turn <unk> than his ass 
 the group then continues along for some reason treating me as the <unk> and everyone gets a say in the presentation 
 except <unk> <unk> he does not know <unk> about ocean <unk> 
 at which he is very upset because he gets a rise out of showing his for the <unk> time medical knowledge 
 okay so this story takes place back when i was an innocent 18 year old girl dating my first real '' boyfriend who we 'll call matt because that was his name 
 so we 'd been dating for almost a year and naive young me was beginning to think this was the real deal <unk> to be young and stupid 
 however it was not to be 
 one day feeling the urge to be the best girlfriend ever i <unk> matt some cookies <unk> 'm ones to be precise and decided to drive them over to his house in order to surprise him 
 before i continue it 's important to understand how matt 's house was set out 
 basically he lived in his parents <unk> house and they occupied the top level while he got the bottom level with a tv room bedroom and bathroom 
 there were stairs at the front of his house leading to the front door on the second <unk> so he had his own personal entrance a door on the ground level into his living space 
 so young me <unk> in with her <unk> <unk> cookies only to find matt in bed fucking some random girl i 'd never seen before 
 needless to say i was heartbroken 
 in the moment i could do nothing more than burst into tears and run back out into my car before driving away 
 in the days that followed i slowly <unk> from hurt to angry and fairly soon i <unk> a plan 
 so one night late in the night me and my closest friend drove to matt 's house quietly parked outside and with the use of some craft <unk> superglue and resentment we carefully <unk> out our plan 
 the next day matt woke up and walked outside to find the word cheater '' 
 printed neatly in <unk> <unk> letters <unk> to his door and - as an added bonus courtesy of my friend - repeated on one side of the bmw he had just received from his parents 
 mutual friends later showed me angry pictures posted by matt on social media and although the glue ran down the doors in some places it was still clearly <unk> 
 fuck you matt 
 : x-post from /r/pettyrevenge as i have been called a scumbag for this one i feel no guilt <unk> <unk> was a dick and i hated him 
 we worked together for a year and he talked down to me at every opportunity 
 whatever 
 his last day was a friday and he had a large <unk> for all of his acquired crap for his long train commute home 
 one of the engineers walked into my office and invited me to the pub after work they were going to <unk> <unk> 
 it turned out they hated him too 
 **the <unk> one of the engineers offered to give him a lift to the train station 
 their car was at the front of a <unk> 
 instead of turning right to the station they took a left into the country 
 <unk> could clearly be seen to get <unk> 
 this is petty – even though he was going to miss the last train home the driver was going to give him a lift half way to catch another appropriate train 
 too soft but that was the only way he would agree to the gag 
 obviously no-one told <unk> this 
 the sun was shining and we were sitting in the garden of a lovely country pub 
 this revenge could well have turned into an <unk> treat 
 only it did not 
 <unk> would not relax 
 he got more and more abusive 
 so much so his <unk> driver colleague took the large <unk> out of the car and told him to start walking 
 so he did 
 the last i ever saw of <unk> was him dragging his case over the top of a hill in glorious <unk> 
 good riddance 
 mods if this edges too far towards illegal i 'll understand if you remove it but i think this sub is the perfect place for this tale 
 about fifteen years ago i had a buddy with whom i liked to go <unk> 
 abandoned buildings woods bridges construction sites you name it 
 we did n't go damage or steal stuff just looked around 
 in my neighborhood there was a long <unk> <unk> facing the street property <unk> <unk> <unk> from the street 
 a new buyer <unk> five or six <unk> <unk> from their <unk> moved them in and stood them on <unk> sort of expecting to build <unk> beneath 
 some <unk> wrecked the lower ones they were <unk> away and the one at the far <unk> was left 
 the property was sold 
 the houses had been placed on big wooden <unk> held up by several <unk> stacks of <unk> ties 
 we had our eyes on <unk> the houses decided to leave the place alone for a while after the <unk> hit then snuck in to check out the one remaining house 
 the wooden deck stuck out from under it only on the back and the left side at the back left corner it was about five feet off the ground 
 the <unk> in the middle opened to an <unk> drop 
 open the front door and it was more like 10 feet 
 nice old <unk> home not much of note but nice to go through especially considering the weird way it was stood 
 there were no no trespassing '' signs 
 we <unk> those where i live if you 're caught in some such place and there are no signs all the police can really do is ask you to leave 
 next door out by the street was a tiny house that always had <unk> <unk> in all the windows day or night 
 a few months go by and my friend found himself homeless 
 i had nowhere for him to crash but i stored his stuff for him 
 he decided he 'd quietly move into that abandoned house 
 arrive late leave early stay quiet and he assumed it 'd be fine 
 he borrowed some old camping gear i had 
 took the closet doors off their tracks and used them to cover the windows removed the glass bowl from the ceiling light and hung the camp <unk> from it on a <unk> <unk> 
 and thus all was well for a month or two until someone had to be the little house next door neighbors behind could n't see and neighbor on other side was never home spotted him and called the police 
 they arrived asked him to <unk> helped him move his stuff down to the ground and said he could return the next night to get it 
 when we came back we found most of his stuff gone and what was n't gone had been smashed to pieces 
 the grass up there was very tall and very <unk> so you 'd really have to know something was there we could <unk> see what looked like a path <unk> up to the area from the little house 
 he was livid -- the police had every right to trespass him but this was a dick move by the nearby neighbors 
 we decided to have some fun and dug into my stash of fireworks 
 i 'm still surprised that everything worked *exactly* as we 'd intended but it did go off without a hitch one <unk> did n't go off but that 's not much 
 we snuck in from the rear through another yard set everything up left the same way went around the block hid across the street and waited 
 first to go were some <unk> <unk> a shrill <unk> followed by a bang 
 lights went on in the little house 
 next a string of <unk> 
 then some <unk> shells -- no firing tube so they just <unk> about 8 feet off the deck and exploded the grass was green at that time of year no fire danger 
 three people came out of the little house just in time to see the <unk> shells 
 of course one 's first thought is n't elaborate <unk> firing '' - when they saw a window on the left side glowing we were pretty sure they believed the <unk> was back and shooting fireworks 
 they got flashlights and <unk> up the hill 
 we had placed cigarettes on the <unk> cut to various lengths they kept burning until they reached the <unk> we 'd come up with this on the former 4th of july to throw together a short show 
 we watched them haul themselves onto the deck at back left saw their lights appear in the picture window at far right as they entered the dining room behind and watched the lights appear in the front bedrooms 
 the window on the side a <unk> one was a bathroom -- between the toilet just beneath the window and the bathtub was a little wall with a towel rail onto which we 'd glued a row of candles 
 the <unk> went out and they left the house surely knowing that they 'd just wasted time and effort going after a guy who 'd arranged a bunch of stuff in order to make them do exactly that 
 it was n't long after that the final blow fell 
 on a <unk> along the back of the property i 'd placed a big <unk> white <unk> <unk> with a full cigarette on it 
 i 'd hoped they would n't notice it as they went in or came back out the firing tube was white and they did n't 
 it went off just as they were <unk> and lit up the house and yard for a few moments i 'd guess as bright as <unk> 
 we were pretty sure the message of you 've been had '' was <unk> 
 a week or so later we snuck in through the back and left a <unk> roll of <unk> on the deck with a full cigarette 
 fur those who do n't know if you light a firecracker string that 's been rolled they set each other off and the result is a solid blast of noise 
 we 'd <unk> about a foot of it so they got about five seconds of <unk> <unk> followed by a <unk> <unk> 
 at their house about 80 feet away it must have been a real <unk> 
 after that we left the matter and the abandoned house was <unk> a few months <unk> so to start off i was in the military for about 10 years and after you are done with basic training and your tech school you get you orders to your first base 
 well when you are fresh out of basic and tech and not married you have to live in the <unk> on the base 
 this happened around <unk> when you had to share your dorm room with a roommate and also share the toilet and shower with the the two people in the room next to yours 
 i had the luck of having this little <unk> asshole as a <unk> that 's what we called the people you shared the bathroom with 
 he would brag constantly about all the girls he had slept with and even had what he called a victim '' book with <unk> pics of all the girls he 'd slept with 
 in all honesty this was none of my business until about a year later he was trying to get in the pants of a girl that i happened to be very good friends with 
 she was an extremely nice girl and wanted nothing to do with one night stands 
 i very politely warned her to watch out for this guy because that 's all he wanted out of her 
 about a week later on a saturday morning this idiot storms into my room while i 'm still asleep and proceeds to attack me in my bed because my female friend turned down going out with him because of what i told her 
 now he continued the whole time to try and punch and kick me while i 'm still half asleep in bed 
 i finally wake up enough to realize what 's going on and throw the little prick across the room 
 he starts to curse at me and tell me i better watch my back and keep my mouth shut 
 so now i 'm up and i 'm thinking what kind of pussy attacks a dude while he is <unk> sleeping in bed 
 i decide i should get up and get done 
 i go jump in the shower remember we all have to share the shower and i see his slightly expensive shampoo sitting on the tub and a very gross idea for revenge pops into my head 
 i decide to unscrew the cap to his shampoo and proceed to jerk off into it 
 i shake it up pretty good as to mix up 
 so to cut it short i made sure to compliment him on how nice and <unk> his hair was and how his shampoo must have a lot of <unk> in it every time i saw him after <unk> me and my friends were like <unk> old we lived in a peaceful and nice <unk> 
 all other people were nice except one old couple 
 they were fed up with life and children 
 we did <unk> and hanging at a bus stop near their house 
 we were well behaving and not too loud kids but still they did n't like us 
 they started to call police saying we were destroying things etc 
 the 2nd time even the police were fed up with the wrong <unk> 
 one day they had broken beer bottles on the bus stop and said we did it 
 we were too young back then <unk> olds did n't drink to have drank those and we happened to notice that there were similar empty beer bottles on their yard 
 they also had their adult son to drive our <unk> <unk> away another friend saw this 
 we had had enough 
 we started to broke bottles on their yard shot bb <unk> on windows blew up their post box many etc 
 in the beginning it was quite frequent but of course <unk> as time went by 
 still every now and then they got their post box blown up 
 we actually gave them quite a lot more than they were asking 
 but the thing is that they did ask for it they did n't need to be assholes 
 in the beginning they did n't state a reason for <unk> us so today i do n't know why they started it 
 tldr : old couple started to fuck with us and we gave them overly <unk> is long but i think a little back story is important 
 i went to a small private liberal arts <unk> college 
 we lived in a bubble – picture classes where most every sentence that comes out of someone’s mouth starts with the two words “i <unk> so we had residence <unk> who were generally students who had graduated the year previous and were – in exchange for free housing free classes and a small spending <unk> – housed with the students to keep order help in emergencies run house meetings wipe <unk> etc 
 etc 
 better than the traditional <unk> mom ” but not by much 
 in the bigger houses on campus there were <unk> on the first floor for first years 
 my girlfriend and i managed to get it as a double her second year thus freeing up two <unk> so we had a living room bathroom and bedroom to ourselves – essentially our own <unk> apartment in a dorm house 
 and our living room wall was up against the <unk> living room wall 
 this wouldn’t have been a big deal if not for a few fun facts about our <unk> that year : * she was finishing up classes required for her master’s degree program and was constantly studying * she was very noise sensitive * she was a petty little bitch fun facts about me and my girlfriend : * we never had classes before lunch because we were both night <unk> * we always had a lot of friends over and parties every weekend * we had two cats one of which hers was a <unk> that never shut up and a dog 
 same as most any other college pets were not allowed 
 the dog was <unk> with another friend so it sometimes lived with us and sometimes lived <unk> 
 needless to say our pets were the worst kept secrets on campus 
 my cat and the dog were brought to my tennis matches – on leash and <unk> of course – as well as <unk> matches and walked around campus daily 
 so she knew we had the pets – but it was n't until we annoyed her one too many times that she decided to make it her <unk> mission to prove we had the pets thus getting us fined $ <unk> per month until pets were gone 
 thanks to the fact it was a very liberal liberal arts college she could not just do a random room inspection – she had to give us 24 hours notice which gave us plenty of time to get the animals out of the room though one time we forgot and ended up hiding both cats in the window seats in the hallway between the living room and bedroom – litter box was hidden in our bedroom closet – we refused to turn the music down because the <unk> wouldn’t shut up the whole time he was in there 
 after about 10 room inspections in a month i was fed up 
 she was being petty because we were noisy '' and though we did try to keep it down late at night we annoyed her no matter what time of day it was 
 edit for clarity : she was that girl in the dorm who told everyone to shut up she 's studying 
 someone walking down the fucking hall too loud '' got bitched at by her 
 and she had a complete other room to study in that was n't sharing a wall with us so i had no sympathy 
 she complained to the girl above her that she was stomping around constantly '' and the girl - who was very sensitive about her weight - ended up moving out of our house very upset 
 she wrote up 90 % of our house for noise violations that is why we wanted to get her to quit 
 so i decided i would prank her until she quit 
 or cried 
 or quit while crying 
 she had a car and a reserved parking spot right behind the house next to the handicap spot 
 so one weekend i borrowed my <unk> truck <unk> to tow a boat and too damn early for a monday morning backed up to her bumper it was a <unk> until just touching and slowly pushed her car into the handicap spot 
 she only used her car on the weekend so chances were she wouldn’t notice the car was moved until it was too late 
 monday she received a parking ticket $ 15 tuesday she received a parking ticket $ 15 
 wednesday she received a parking ticket $ 15 
 thing is after three tickets your car is <unk> 
 thursday her car was <unk> $ 35 
 at this point public safety called her and told her to get her car out of the fucking handicap spot 
 i was walking down the hall past her room and the door was open that evening and she was talking to some other housemates <unk> “i swear i put the parking brake on 
 i don’t know how it ended up in that spot ” one look from me and everyone knew who was responsible 
 and that was just the beginning of months of horrible & amp petty pranks i pulled on that poor woman in my <unk> to get her to quit
