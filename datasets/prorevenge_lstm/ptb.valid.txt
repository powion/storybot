 <unk> with that time my brother and sil moved back here permanently 
 however from what i understand sil is technically still on a tourist visa which has expired by now since they came in february and i 'm not really sure what was going on with the whole paperwork process 
 they seem to be bad at planning 
 sil has mentioned before that she wants to have a kid with my brother because she would not only get paid maternity leave here but it would cement her staying 
 she told my wife this over facebook messages as well 
 when my wife left to do her semester abroad and brother and sil moved in we hung out a lot more 
 at first my wife was cool with it and would say hi etc 
 but things changed when bro and sil invited me on a road trip to <unk> something that my wife has always wanted to do with me but we never got around to 
 after that she would become short in her answers whenever i said i was hanging out with them 
 she began to make subtle comments about sil and the more i saw them the more vicious the comments got 
 as a result i did n't go out with my bro so much when i knew sil would be there 
 i love my brother but honestly he takes a lot of energy to be around so it 's not something i really minded too much 
 however things came to a head when both sil and my wife entered the same photo competition 
 my wife entered first and then sil saw her post and entered two days after 
 then she and sil engaged in pretty childish subtle facebook <unk> about each other always <unk> as someone '' or this person '' 
 my wife was pissed and i took the opportunity to ask her what was going on between her and sil 
 she basically told me that she resented how sil got to see me all the time now and how she feels <unk> compared to her because sil does all the cooking although its mostly those <unk> dishes people make for instagram and not very <unk> for me and i am the one who cooks in our marriage 
 sil is also asian and i made the mistake of telling my wife that i had had a thing for asian girls back when i was 20 and everything japanese was all <unk> 
 she was also upset that i had gone to bro and sil 's wedding without her while she had been abroad during her <unk> 's degree 
 she also is afraid that i 'm going to start smoking again because of them 
 i told her it was not something i was interested in because pot mostly makes me paranoid and depressed 
 she also brought up that she hates how i will talk shit about my brother and sil mostly about their need to constantly talking about smoking and some of their very <unk> ideas about things but act perfectly fine to their faces 
 she said she feels like i 'm <unk> her by saying sil is annoying but i still go see her 
 she said it makes her feel like i will lie to fit the situation and that bothers her 
 well i had n't seen bro or sil for a few weeks now and my wife and i were back to normal 
 she came home and we were having a good time seeing all our other friends 
 she did n't even bat an <unk> when i said some of the guys had invited me out for a guy 's night 
 all was good 
 then last week my brother called and asked me if i wanted to hang out 
 he sounded pretty high and i told him no 
 <unk> casually asked what was up and i told her 
 she got a bit quiet then shrugged and went back to doing whatever 
 about 10 minutes afterwards she said she was going to take the dog for a walk and run to the shop to get some <unk> for dinner 
 this is basically what went down 
 she went outside called the police anonymously and said that she was a concerned neighbor '' and could smell <unk> coming from my brother 's flat 
 the police came 
 my brother and sil were arrested and fined 
 however when they went to pull up sil 's profile to record the incident they discovered her expired tourist visa 
 she had to be transferred to a sort of holding '' <unk> for people who are in queue for being deported 
 now there is a whole shitstorm happening 
 my brother is beyond upset and the family is shocked 
 this is n't really something that can be worked around as 1. <unk> is illegal in this country and 2. she was on an expired visa and they did n't file the correct paperwork for her to live here legally 
 so if she is deported she may face a <unk> year ban 
 this means either the end of their marriage or my brother will need to figure out how ot move to the us with her 
 the thing is no one knows it was my wife except me 
 and she does n't even sound the least bit <unk> 
 we had a huge row about it and she stood by her decision saying that if sil was that stupid to do illegal drugs as well as not have her papers in order then it was on her 
 if i 'm being honest i do n't care so much about sil being deported but i care that my wife felt so threatened by her that she went to this length 
 she 's the type to made subtle remarks and be <unk> but she has never done anything close to this before 
 so now i 'm in a real <unk> 
 i really do n't know what to do 
 i definitely can not tell the family and i do n't really feel the obligation to anyway i 'm not close with my mom because she left me as a kid and i do n't talk to any of my relatives really except my dad and brother 
 but i can not just let this slide 
 i need to <unk> upon her that she has potentially ruined a marriage all in effort to remove someone she finds annoying from our lives 
 someone we do n't even have to see every day 
 what advice can you guys give me 
 there 's no one else i can even talk to about this 
 update : holy hell 
 this really blew up 
 i will post a real update soon but your comments and messages are very appreciated 
 things are quite tense atm but tomorrow we have agreed upon a <unk> 
 will update letting you all know what happens now with us and the situation 
 as of this moment sil is definitely being deported 
 tl dr : wife and sil have <unk> wife called the cops on sil while knowing that sil has an expired visa 
 sil is on her way to being deported 
 **edit : this is not my story 
 the story was posted in <unk> by another user 
 <unk> aunt 's story 
 what had happened was equally as simple as it was annoying 
 her group of friends would be walking by a <unk> of <unk> and as a scare <unk> they would lean into their faces and <unk> at them like dogs 
 they captured the reaction they dreamed of so this sort of bullying happened for many weeks 
 not long after this same barking '' bullshit was being used across the school 
 girls who got this treatment really lost their shit which just egged the seniors on further 
 my aunt and her closest friend were the only ones left that stood through the pestering to handle the situation 
 therefore the targets on their backs had grown <unk> 
 the final day the girls were approached had been building 
 towards the seniors they <unk> each one <unk> and determined to get a reaction out of the <unk> <unk> chorus of girls leaned in all at once and were just about to <unk> <unk> <unk> my aunt had <unk> <unk> their stunned faces 
 faces watching her hand reach into her pocket 
 she tossed a handful of dog bones for the bitches and kept on walking 
 and that was the end of that 
 this is a <unk> from tales from tech support 
 i was told to post this here as it definitely <unk> as pro revenge you send me one spam 
 i help get your <unk> company shut down and nail you for $ <unk> out of your personal pocket 
 i 've run it by the mods before i posted it just to make sure it was <unk> 
 i 've <unk> the links to the press <unk> as well as the actual <unk> 's name we 'll be referring to it as the <unk> <unk> 
 - - - - - <unk> jack and <unk> <unk> <unk> - present - those who hunt <unk> - part the second - i 'm up all night to get <unk> - - - - - nearly a year had passed and it was the middle of <unk> <unk> i 'd left the managed services provider i worked at the one what <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> harpy and i was working at the hospital chain in <unk> 
 i 'd gotten engaged and i 'd moved to an apartment one block from my office 
 the <unk> who 'd bothered me in 2011 had <unk> off never to be seen or heard from again and the <unk> of crap that had taken up so much space in my <unk> file <unk> down to a few <unk> scams every now and again 
 of course there was still the occasional spam that got through and those were usually deleted 
 life was pretty good 
 sure enough though that was a <unk> thing 
 more holes in <unk> 's <unk> function had been found and people were using it once again to spam 
 payday loan <unk> <unk> my inbox - my retribution was swift and severe 
 a bit of <unk> found the name and home phone number of the ceo of the company whose products they were spamming and a quick call to his house again in arizona - what is it with that state and <unk> 
 during dinner got me the name and contact information for the <unk> who was spamming me 
 it did n't hurt that i <unk> when i called the president - he knew about the guy i 'd nailed prior to this 
 needless to say that ended <unk> from them quickly 
 one night my phone <unk> at 6 pm to signal an incoming e-mail 
 a quick look at it showed that it was a typical spam - it named a company whose name started with <unk> which was a penny auction site similar to the <unk> scam that was shut down around august <unk> an <unk> link was inside it run through a <unk> <unk> but it was n't anything that <unk> and the network request panel in <unk> <unk> + shift + <unk> just fyi could n't track properly 
 i fired up <unk> to record my thought process while i went through analysis for the spam 
 and yes this is the incident that <unk> my infamous drunken <unk> spam analysis video to which i 've made references to other times 
 no you do n't get to see it it drops my real name in there 
 well let 's see 
 the <unk> are <unk> there 's the use of a <unk> <unk> server in the <unk> there 's no visible physical address for removal there 's no - huh that 's odd '' 
 at the bottom of the message it said the following : i am sharing this opportunity just once but if you have doubts you can <unk> anytime by simply send a blank email to and put <unk> as your subject the only question was where the hell were you supposed to send the e-mail to 
 there was no physical address and the e-mail address was no doubt falsified 
 a wonderful <unk> idea struck me and i opened up my laptop 
 while it <unk> i kept going through my analysis and i got the <unk> id from the link 
 a <unk> of their site showed no functional privacy policy no terms of service nothing but a site that seemed designed to collect e-mail addresses and skype names for a future launch 
 however they did have a page with their lawyer 's bio on it in which he had a link to his facebook page so i paid a quick visit to said page and <unk> it for a bit 
 after a series of messages with him amazingly enough he was online at the time in which i asked to be removed he stated that he was n't a point of contact for his client and said that i should go to them directly for <unk> requests 
 he did n't however give me the owner 's name or any contact information 
 i shrugged it off 
 no matter i 'd have it easy enough after a bit of work 
 besides who likes dealing with lawyers 
 at that point my laptop chimed to signal that it was done <unk> and i launched <unk> on it 
 i <unk> over to <unk> and for kicks and giggles i attempted to create a new mail account with the same address the <unk> had used as a <unk> 
 let 's see ... ** <unk> ** at yahoo dot <unk> ... '' i <unk> 
 no way he 's stupid enough to use an account that does n't exist if he does n't want <unk> violations '' 
 a few seconds later i completed my <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> read : <unk> as yahoo allowed me to create the e-mail address successfully 
 i <unk> in a <unk> on one of my usual passwords and a few seconds later i was at the inbox which started to <unk> as replies with the word remove as the subject <unk> in <unk> 
 yes that 's right 
 i managed to create a mail account one that was <unk> already being used for <unk> requests for a <unk> / penny auction scheme 's <unk> and thus managed to prove <unk> that the <unk> never had any intention of <unk> <unk> 
 but wait - it gets better 
 <unk> does have some teeth 
 the <unk> amendment holds the key - the companies being <unk> can be held liable for damages <unk> penalties and <unk> if they know or should have known that their business was being promoted by spam 
 i was sure that this would pass a <unk> <unk> test for this - and after consulting with a lawyer friend of mine i was reassured and then some 
 over the next day or two i gathered information about the company - i dug up the <unk> records which showed it to be an <unk> based out of <unk> 
 a few calls to various agencies later i 'd reached someone who 'd given a damn and i was told to forward on all the information i 'd gathered about the company to the <unk> commissioner of <unk> and insurance which handled such things like insurance <unk> and as it happened penny auction scams for which it had issued a warning about for <unk> a few months prior 
 meanwhile a <unk> <unk> of replies <unk> into the yahoo account most of which had bodies filled with expletives and <unk> 
 everything i gathered including <unk> to the yahoo account was passed on to them as well as the <unk> and <unk> 
 i noticed they did n't change the password to the account but i did n't care really 
 the bodies of the replies that came in were hilarious 
 i did n't hear anything from the <unk> for a few weeks though i 'd noticed the web had gone quiet about the site and the <unk> forums i <unk> on for intel strangely seemed to have a lot of threads complaining about that company <unk> for no apparent reason 
 one <unk> fall morning translation : 75 degrees and dry - it is texas after all in <unk> i walked into my cube and <unk> my <unk> <unk> then went and got 32 <unk> of cafe <unk> from the break room before sitting down and loading <unk> 
 i loaded up the <unk> 's site to see if there was an update on the <unk> <unk> 
 i did not expect to see that the commissioner of <unk> and insurance had a press release up stating they 'd ordered them to stop doing business 
 i mean i 'm sure as hell not complaining 
 it 's rare as hell that you get to see your efforts vindicated in such a fashion 
 in all <unk> though i 'd be lying if i said i did n't do a happy dance and <unk> rather loudly in my cube 
 i was quite happy that a certain coworker whom i 've mentioned before was n't working there that day because the look i would get from her would be both <unk> and <unk> <unk> with more than just a hint of why the hell are you doing that at work '' though the looks i got from the head of network security and my other nearby coworkers almost - almost - <unk> my joy a bit 
 a few weeks later the <unk> put up a new press release in which they stated that the owner had been nailed for illegally selling investment opportunities 
 not only did they have to pay back the <unk> the <unk> of the company ended up paying out of his pocket to reimburse them 
 ever since then it 's been very rare that i 've <unk> spam 
 sure there 's tons out there 
 yes they 're annoying <unk> and the <unk> are probably a rather large <unk> <unk> on the <unk> ass of <unk> 
 but when you get results like that you just ca n't really top it and a part of you does n't even want to try you know 
 - - - - - tl dr : we are <unk> - the keyboard <unk> - and all those other people who have no idea what 's going on are the cattle 
 <unk> 
 - - - - - schadenfreude is a delicious thing 
 it 's even better when you have the law backing you up 
 if you want to see more check out my <unk> to <unk> i have n't made any acts of revenge as sweet as this maybe the worst thing i did was tag along while my roommates poured water into another <unk> <unk> 's new <unk> she got from her sugar daddy when she forgot to close the sunroof ... not to mention it 's kind of a <unk> for my late father <unk> <unk> c. <unk> <unk> tldr : dad moved up to portland developed health issues sold house to a complete <unk> since his house was nearly impossible to sell made sure <unk> had a bad time when he moved in after <unk> harassed him <unk> <unk> & amp nbsp in 2005 my dad moved up to portland due to cheaper housing prices but nobody else was in a position to move ... i had a business <unk> in pretty good money + other personal reasons my grandma got <unk> and needed <unk> care right as he was closing <unk> but when she <unk> we could n't afford to bring her up since now she needed 15 
 meds and we 'd have to pay <unk> for her <unk> ... that left my <unk> to go up there with him but she divorced 3 years later so in late 2008 it was just him and 2 <unk> cats 
 to make things worse he was a <unk> guy but his health rapidly <unk> with <unk> collapse high blood pressure that he had every single side effect from including depression and thoughts of suicide that he acted on : - that never went away his full physical never tested his blood sugar but it <unk> to 700 on one er visit and all the <unk> that came with it and cancer as the cherry on top 
 with the medical bills he could n't <unk> a job due to frequent <unk> and was on disability and around 2012 my computer repair business <unk> and got a job that can barely <unk> myself let alone have a budget to go out there and at least visit the poor guy for the weekend so he had no choice but to sell the house 
 at the same time the housing market slowed down especially portland there was a crack house up the street that <unk> the neighborhood my dad had a <unk> for <unk> <unk> was n't particularly <unk> he was on the medical <unk> program so the house always smelled like <unk> and had a few plants growing and last but not least since he could n't even afford to move he had to <unk> on the proceeds of the house to afford his new living arrangements ... all of that made his house a hard one to sell 
 so after 5 months he finally sells off the house to this guy that was a bit of a prick from the <unk> but <unk> ca n't be <unk> 
 the contract said to give him 14 days after closing <unk> to move out but instead of waiting for that <unk> day the new owners loads up a u-haul the split second it closed <unk> parks it in front of the house and instead of nicely helping my <unk> <unk> cancer they even go as far as breaking in and <unk> him my dad even almost shot him since he thought he was a <unk> 
 of course getting portland pd involved was useless as they said it was a civil issue instead of treating it as harassment 
 **the revenge** & amp nbsp me a few of my friends that knew his <unk> and of course his buddies put our heads together and put up all sorts of ways to screw with the house : * he pissed and crapped in most of the hvac floor vents & amp nbsp * threw <unk> of his cat 's excrement into the hvac vents as well which owing to the smell it gave them <unk> <unk> to <unk> on the vents too & amp nbsp * went into the <unk> and hid a cheap mp3 <unk> above the master bedroom to turn itself on that played a creepy sound like scratches animal noises and even <unk> laughs every few hours at night by getting a <unk> for the speakers to turn on at 1am then i made a <unk> long silent mp3 track and sent it via <unk> ... i spent the entire afternoon walking him through it all over the phone and <unk> on his computer and it 's probably the most expensive and involved prank but it 's worth it & amp nbsp * removed the <unk> from certain door <unk> & amp nbsp * <unk> the <unk> <unk> just enough to jet out if you turn it on & amp nbsp * subscribed to every gay <unk> mag + <unk> <unk> we can think of such as <unk> and <unk> to be sent to that address & amp nbsp * poured <unk> out on the larger trees one of his friends was a <unk> who of course specialized in <unk> removal and & amp nbsp * dumped a few open cans of <unk> between the wall <unk> happened last week and the details may be a bit off since it was told by my dad 
 all <unk> used here refer to either the company or company owner based on the context 
 my dad is a network consultant and <unk> 
 his work involves selling and <unk> wireless equipment and providing communication <unk> 
 a few months ago he was bidding for a <unk> million dollar government project <unk> against <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> were friends as they <unk> from the same <unk> 
 a bit of background info : when my dad 's company <unk> first started him and <unk> were good friends as they both <unk> equipment from the same <unk> 
 after <unk> grew my dad switched to a different <unk> and slowly <unk> and <unk> started turning into <unk> 
 however my dad was a <unk> guy and always maintained friendly relationships with <unk> 
 one of the requirements for being eligible for the project was that the company bidding needed to possess a special certificate not sure of the name but it was a huge process to obtain 
 but a company without the certificate could <unk> it from another company <unk> the certificate for a short period of time or if two companies worked together only one of the companies needed to be certified 
 only <unk> and <unk> had the certificate 
 since <unk> was bidding via <unk> working together they did n't require a certificate 
 so if <unk> won they would share the profits with <unk> as they only got in through <unk> 's certificate 
 so the bidding begins and all the companies produced a quote 
 <unk> produced the lowest quote and won 
 now <unk> also a consultant which meant once the bidding was finished he would go through the winning company 's quote to see if it was <unk> to be implemented 
 and surprisingly the winning bid was so low that even going by bare minimum the company would actually be losing money 
 my dad knew about the agreement between <unk> and <unk> and decided to have a talk with the owner of <unk> 
 & gt <unk> : any reason why you 're losing out money on this project 
 <unk> : what do you mean losing out 
 we 're making a nice profit 
 <unk> : are you sure 
 you might want to take a look at your bid over here 
 <unk> : this was n't what we agreed on 
 hold on i need to check 
 <unk> called back a few hours later & gt <unk> : i ca n't reach <unk> 
 he 's in a meeting 
 <unk> : you have a bigger problem to deal with right now 
 the bid has no mention of your company 
 he 's taken it on as a <unk> company 
 <unk> : that 's impossible 
 he does n't even possess the certificate 
 <unk> : your company leasing out the certificate tells a different story 
 <unk> : no way 
 i never <unk> that 
 these have got to be <unk> documents 
 now the way things work here is that if you have a dispute with the bid you 'll have to file a claim and an <unk> would be launched which <unk> slow and <unk> due to the number of authorities involved 
 and my dad ca n't testify to this as discussing the winning bid is illegal 
 & gt <unk> : you have to do something 
 <unk> : you 're in luck 
 his equipment is not capable of providing coverage to the entire district and it 's really outdated 
 i 'll bring this up in the board meeting after that my dad attended the meeting and brought up the problems in <unk> 's equipment which made the government official reject <unk> 's bid and hold a new project bid 
 this gave enough time for <unk> to file a report 
 the report went through <unk> won the contract yay 
 <unk> was banned from <unk> from further projects and a few charges were filed i guess and the alliance between <unk> and <unk> ended 
 tl dr : company tries to screw over friend gets <unk> up by friend and <unk> previous situation : back when i was around 16 years old i had this friend tom who had major issues with his physical education professor 
 he 'd been going to the same middle-school <unk> since he was 12 years old and through some odd <unk> joke every year he 'd been assigned to the same professor 
 one that clearly had it out for him personally 
 you see tommy was n't particularly athletic or fit 
 i 'm not saying he was lazy or in poor physical condition he just was n't the type for <unk> or sports 
 this teacher on the other hand had this r. <unk> <unk> of i will <unk> you private <unk> 
 <unk> of <unk> that well just did n't work '' with the likes of tommy 
 hence for tom the last four years <unk> a <unk> <unk> of verbal abuse poor grades yes <unk> classes are graded in <unk> and <unk> petty crap directed at him by this <unk> <unk> wannabe 
 tommy was always able to deal with crap he was <unk> by being a stone cold vindictive bastard 
 i 'm not even kidding - all this happened 20 years ago and i 'm somewhat afraid of him finding out i typed out and posted this story 
 they say an <unk> never forgets anything 
 well my childhood friend tommy would make the average <unk> look like a mentally handicapped <unk> 's patient 
 this cute little boy had the power to hate 
 i went to another school than him so i was never fully aware of the <unk> between him and 1st 
 sgt 
 fuckface other than the occasional fuming <unk> of the crap the bastard had put tommy through recently and the subsequent my vengeance shall be terrible <unk> 
 but nothing ever seemed to happen 
 i <unk> this up to him taking the high road '' <unk> the bastard his <unk> and continuing with his life 
 oh how mistaken i was 
 the setup : tommy was now in his final year on middle school and it seemed that staff sergeant <unk> was showing signs of <unk> 
 the prof 's <unk> <unk> showed signs of <unk> out and a <unk> of <unk> had been established 
 tom 's grades were ok nothing fancy but he was going to graduate and as such he applied to join the committee organizing the graduation party 
 looking back this should 've <unk> everyone as he was in no way shape or form the kind of kid to join any committee group or organization that involved doing anything else than smoking pot or listening to music 
 but hey to be really honest me and his other friends did n't really think anything of it 
 we <unk> it up to him liking a particular girl in said committee or some other juvenile crap like that and left him to it 
 we were wrong 
 you see the graduation party was to take place in the school 's auditorium so all tables desks and chairs normally placed there had to be moved into the <unk> for storage 
 and that was tom 's angle : to sabotage <unk> and <unk> his <unk> <unk> - the <unk> 
 six weeks prior to the party tommy started saving up his <unk> 
 no more cigarettes and pot - just a <unk> <unk> amount of cash money 
 on the day of the party this had reached the equivalent of around $ 60 us burning a hole in his pockets 
 on graduation day tom had spent most of his <unk> day <unk> furniture from the auditorium to the <unk> <unk> desk upon desk and chair upon chair 
 and he had been <unk> <unk> about it too 
 so much so that the principal had given him the keys to the <unk> ordering him to lock it once done and make sure nobody would get locked in as the school would be closed for <unk> after the party was finished 
 so now tom had everything he needed for his plot of vengeance : access to the gym a stack of desks to use as <unk> <unk> and $ 60 in cash 
 the revenge : during a small break tom went to the local <unk> 's shop and spent $ 60 on as many <unk> <unk> as <unk> could get his hands on 
 he came back to school with something like 20 pounds of meat - <unk> from chicken and <unk> to steak and <unk> 
 he then spent the entire night <unk> this meat every place he could think of : over the ceiling <unk> inside of the lockers he even <unk> <unk> meat into the <unk> of the <unk> climbing racks 
 and then he left handing over the keys to the principal and going home 
 the effects : over summer tom and i had a bit of a falling out and as i did n't have any other friends going to that school i never heard about the <unk> of tom 's actions 
 that is until my kid brother started going to that same school some 7 years <unk> 
 it turned out that the day after summer recess the teacher that inspired the whole action had also been the one to open the <unk> <unk> recess 
 the <unk> remained closed for two more weeks while the <unk> crews had to rip out the ceiling most of the walls and bin the majority of the <unk> of sports usually found in a <unk> <unk> 
 as for the legacy of ton 's actions : the <unk> he brought upon the now retired professor have been spoken about in <unk> <unk> ever since finding their way into middle-school <unk> : i heard that one day mr so-and-so opened the <unk> after a vacation and was assaulted by <unk> of <unk> <unk> '' 
 i heard that once he opened the doors he was <unk> by a stench so putrid his <unk> went white and he never could smell again 
 ah to be so young again ... legal action was attempted but failed due to lack of proof or so i was told 
 tl dr : professor picks on student for four years student <unk> meat throughout <unk> and leaves it there over summer recess biology ensues edit : i <unk> a word and a couple of enters 
 <unk> <unk> own a hair <unk> in a small town in the country 
 there is not a whole lot to do where we are and my shop is not just a <unk> it is a gathering place 
 many of my regulars have also become good friends 
 i have known <unk> almost three years and we have become pretty close 
 day before yesterday <unk> came to my work almost in tears 
 a while back she and her husband hit a rough patch and were considering divorce 
 while they were apart she is <unk> by a man she 's never met on facebook who she begins texting and later <unk> with despite her better judgement 
 he gradually gets more <unk> of her even though they have never met in person 
 he knows her situation with her husband and gets very jealous ... a few days ago <unk> finds out she is pregnant so she and her husband decide to try to work out their differences and stay together to raise their family they also have two other girls under 6 years 
 everybody is happy ... that is except facebook guy 
 <unk> tells him that she is pregnant and has decided to stay married and must no longer text him 
 he gets angry and threatens to tell her husband about their messages and pictures despite the fact that nothing has happened between <unk> even if it did n't ruin her marriage he is threatening to embarrass her with it 
 the man is willing to try to ruin a pregnant woman 's life and break up a family ... all because he feels that he is entitled to pictures of her <unk> 
 that 's where i come in ... apparently i went to high school with this man and even though i dont remember him we are facebook friends 
 <unk> just wanted me to flirt with him to <unk> him from her 
 but i could never be presented with such a perfect example of an asshole and not try to make an example of him 
 at first i play <unk> i ca n't seem to place you but you look familiar to me cutie '' 
 he is not cute 
 i flatter him and get him to send me some nude pics 
 at first they are just close up pictures of his cock so i tell him that anyone can get a pic off the net 
 i wan na see your face '' 
 i told him i was at work and could n't send any back but it was so hot being around all these people and them not having a clue about the <unk> pics he is sending me 
 in reality we are all gathered around my phone laughing our asses off at this <unk> <unk> jackass 
 by the end of the night i have received many many nudes and even a video of him <unk> off 
 classy 
 he might know <unk> and i know each other on fb he lives in the next small town over but has no idea how close we are 
 last night i found out he is a higher level of jerk than any of us thought 
 he is <unk> and hit on the 15 year old daughter of another friend he does n't realize we know 
 when she put him down he called her a whore 
 if there was ever a thought of going easy on him it was <unk> right then 
 we have a <unk> plan ... i want to <unk> him to the shop under the <unk> of a <unk> to meet you 
 just as we get him all settled in <unk> will arrive for her hair appt 
 well facebook guy 
 i did n't know <unk> troll was your <unk> 
 : then i 'll say well <unk> i have kinda been talking to this <unk> giggle giggle '' 
 we 'd like to drag out the <unk> before i reveal to him the fact that none of this is a coincidence and if he does n't leave my friend the fuck alone i will <unk> the entire <unk> area with his nude photos and upload his <unk> film somewhere appropriate 
 i have saved all the texts and messages and will post them if there 's any interest in how this plays out 
 i hope he shows up 
 am i evil 
 tldr : jackass man throws big fit and threatens my friend 
 i pretend to like him and he sends me lots of pictures of himself 
 idiot has no idea she and i are friends 
 i had a shitty neighbor 
 his property <unk> the rear lol words <unk> 
 of mine 
 he was a bitter old shit who spent his time in his <unk> <unk> garden on our property line 
 an italian guy the kind whose <unk> <unk> probably made his famous '' red sauce 
 we were a young family at the time just the first wave of new people starting to <unk> the <unk> neighborhood 
 we had a <unk> and a baby 
 we did n't have much money to work with that first summer so i spent a lot of time in the yard doing my best to landscape the overgrown <unk> left by the previous owners 
 i basically ripped everything out until we had a lawn 
 we had record <unk> that summer and everyone 's property had standing water 
 that old <unk> starts screaming at me one day while working out back 
 i ca n't understand half of it because it 's a mix of old man <unk> and italian 
 apparently he was blaming my <unk> of massive <unk> on my property for flooding his garden 
 it did n't have anything to do with the regular <unk> of rain we were getting or that our properties were at the bottom of a hill 
 once my attempt at <unk> had worn out i ignored him turned up my headphones and went back to work 
 i was ripping out the last long stretch of <unk> and laying grass seed along the rear property line 
 the next day we get a knock on our door 
 it 's a city inspector asking us to show them the <unk> we installed without a permit 
 i had no idea what they were talking about so i asked how they knew about it 
 they claimed they could n't say but they wanted to see the rear property line i had worked on yesterday 
 i simply told them that i had not installed <unk> i had removed <unk> and <unk> 
 pointing out the supposed <unk> location i indicated that no one in their right mind would install <unk> there 
 they agreed and left 
 the plot <unk> slightly 
 i should mention that this was n't just me - that old <unk> had a similar demeanor with his other <unk> neighbors 
 one of them was a <unk> carpenter who lived next to me and he recommended that i just offer to beat the fuck out of that old <unk> like he did the last time that old <unk> complained to him 
 apparently that was the <unk> standard in the neighborhood 
 i however was not interested in beating up an old <unk> who was clearly all too happy to run to the city with lies 
 i went about my business until that old <unk> yelled at my wife and baby while they were alone in the yard one day 
 my mother was helping at the house and went outside to see what was happening 
 that old <unk> screamed at my mother too 
 old man <unk> <unk> words surprising volume shaking <unk> etc 
 well fuck him 
 the old neighborhood may have opted to beat the shit out of that old <unk> but he was quite clearly too full of shit for anyone to ever completely beat the shit out of him 
 i pulled some money from other house projects and i built a fence 
 it was a gorgeous <unk> fence 
 it was made out of <unk> a brilliant white and installed professionally by fence ... <unk> 
 it was a perfect white picket fence the american dream of fencing a <unk> of <unk> hope in the middle of a <unk> neighborhood of overgrown yards and cars on blocks 
 i have a <unk> just thinking about it 
 except for that old <unk> - our shared property line did not get a white picket fence 
 our shared property line got an 8 foot tall solid security fence 
 i watched him that day from my window as that old <unk> stood in his garden and <unk> at the workers installing the <unk> equivalent of the <unk> wall along our property line and his beloved garden 
 that old <unk> may have noticed the <unk> dropping because his entire garden was now cast in shadow 
 i waited at the window most of that day 
 i watched his garden 
 i watched him in his garden 
 i watched him wait for the sun to come back 
 the sun did not return to his <unk> 
 with his <unk> landscaping of cheap <unk> <unk> trees and various other <unk> crap and my new fence his garden no longer had much sun exposure 
 the weather got <unk> the fall and winter passed and i saw less and less of that old <unk> 
 i saw him <unk> the next season but i rarely saw him outdoors after that year 
 his garden was <unk> according to my view from our second floor 
 when i started this post i told you that i had a shitty neighbor 
 the following winter i saw someone new in that old <unk> 's yard 
 i never saw that old <unk> 's family presumably because his attitude towards his neighbors carried over to his family 
 i greeted the <unk> thinking he had just moved in 
 it turned out that he was that old <unk> 's son and that that old <unk> had <unk> over the year and had to be moved to a care <unk> 
 i 'm assuming he died that year because a new family moved in during the summer 
 i removed the security fencing and replaced it with picket to match the rest of the property 
 good <unk> make good <unk> background info : this guy was had bullied me during <unk> school grades 5-6 
 this story takes place during high school my sophomore year about a year ago 
 this guy lets call him <unk> gets involved in the group called <unk> 
 basically it 's a huge <unk> scheme where they try to make you sell energy drinks called <unk> to others and <unk> others into the group 
 joining costs $ 500 dollars to get product to give out to people and you pay $ 100 every month for a refill 
 i personally loved these energy drinks but there was no way in hell i was paying for them 
 additional info at the bottom arse messages me on facebook trying to get me to go to a meeting at a guys apartment for a business meeting and that there would be free energy drinks 
 he never specified what it was for but i went anyways 
 i listen to what they have to say and figure what it is and i tell them that i do n't have the money but if he pays for it that i would make enough money to pay him back 
 he knew i was smart and he thought i would be able to do it 
 i wait a few days for <unk> was <unk> cans of drinks to arrive 
 as soon as i get them i close the <unk> account and message him karma is a bitch is n't it 
 thanks for the drinks '' the goal of the game is to keep them on the phone for as long as possible 
 my record is <unk> minutes 
 here is how it works ... me : hello 
 <unk> : hi could i interest you in useless crap today 
 me : why yes yes you can 
 i 've always wanted to buy useless crap from someone i 've never met over the telephone 
 is there different levels of useless crap 
 could i purchase the gold <unk> crap 
 would you like my credit card now or later 
 <unk> : please hold while i connect you with our sales <unk> 
 me : yes please 
 <unk> : hello 
 i am the useless crap sales <unk> how can i help you 
 me : i want to purchase the gold <unk> useless crap please 
 <unk> : excellent 
 can i get your credit card number please 
 me : ya hang on just <unk> while i run upstairs and grab my wallet 
 do you mind if i put you on hold for just a <unk> 
 <unk> : of course 
 take your time 
 set you phone down at this point and go do something 
 anything really 
 after about 5 minutes return to the phone and tell him you ca n't find your wallet and that it must be in the laundry - please hold 
 repeat this with other locations car truck garage <unk> bathroom closet etc 
 i like to play this game while watching a tv show and i only pick up the phone during <unk> 
 they will stay on hold as long as you reassure them that you intend to purchase their crap 
 i once had a manager call me back after the sales <unk> had hung up 
 the manager was pissed and was cussing at me about me being an asshole 
 i tried to reassure him that i truly wanted to purchase his crap but he just kept saying do n't play fucking games with me 
 i laughed and laughed and laughed once he had hung <unk> this story more or less <unk> the last two years of my life 
 i 'm currently a <unk> or possibly <unk> 
 major <unk> on going to a major university on a scholarship 
 as part of a rather poorly thought out and even more poorly executed plan to * '' improve standards 
 * i had to take junior and senior math from the new teacher 
 she was terrible 
 you see this particular teacher had absolutely no understanding of math whatsoever 
 the school required her class <unk> 
 the principal was an even bigger prick than her but you ca n't in em all junior year because of the act you should have seen how <unk> <unk> 
 this was bad because beyond being an idiot she was a <unk> proud whiny <unk> 
 for example she has a habit of trying to bully students who disagree with her into submission 
 strike one 
 she also likes multiple choice tests 
 so do i. the problem is that her tests rarely have the correct answers as an option 
 strike two 
 she also had no idea how to teach the math 
 a single simple example problem would take 45 minutes or until a student figured out how to do it and solved it for her 
 otherwise class was just trying different <unk> to solve a problem over and over again 
 she loved the <unk> and that 's how you <unk> solve this problem '' 
 with a big <unk> grin 
 we heard that eight or ten times a class 
 strike three <unk> now i took her class junior year and <unk> through it bored out of my mind irritated because she would fail me on the same assignments that my friends had <unk> i copied an assignment once just to see what the shift was 
 she usually dropped my grades by thirty or <unk> points on average 
 i <unk> the other students in the class trying to help them pass for which i got a detention and a stern talking to 
 i also failed the assignment for cheating '' <unk> senior year would be different 
 <unk> first semester of class i did nothing but cause her pain 
 i 'd gotten a guaranteed full ride from the aforementioned university so i knew she could n't touch me 
 the time she spent trying to solve a problem i 'd solve it in fifteen seconds or so in my head tell the guy behind me who would then write it down and then proceed to make <unk> remarks and making fun of her general stupidity to the other students 
 eventually i 'd get bored and sleep until the guy behind me woke me up and <unk> meaning that they 'd finally solved the problem and i had been right 
 she got incredibly desperate towards the end trying to <unk> me for insubordination trying to make me repeat high school by failing me please i had eight math credits to trying to bring the principal in to bully me into agreement 
 up until she tried to <unk> me i was playing nice 
 she treated me like crap i treat her like crap we can both hate each other 
 then this happened 
 i should note that my mother <unk> <unk> at a local university and is second or third from the head of the department 
 about this time she gets involved and starts being an <unk> '' using this as an opportunity to <unk> the teacher 's remaining reputation while we filled out letter after letter to the school board and i threw out via the internet and school board meetings the general <unk> of the teacher 
 i 'm friends with a number of school board members 
 by second semester i 'd had enough and dropped the class 
 she relaxed on everyone else and found out she had been fired 
 it 's hard to come back from that 
 tl dr : idiot teacher tries to get pushy i get her ass fired 
 edit : i only managed to drop the class because i was friends with the school board 
 many people could n't drop her class even though they had the credits and they did n't need it 
 a lot of people lost scholarships and took huge hits to their gpa due to this teacher 's <unk> and bullying 
 i know at least two students that lost full rides to major private <unk> 
 <unk> : ** my house is relatively big and my aunt lives with me my mom my dad and my brother 
 she 's a <unk> devout <unk> to the point that she <unk> all other <unk> and <unk> for whatever weird reason 
 she <unk> them all the time yet nobody really knows about it but me 
 **the story : ** so my aunt 's just gotten a new boyfriend and it looks like he 's *the <unk> 
 problem is he 's just like my aunt : bitchy <unk> except when it comes to my aunt and a devout <unk> who hates other <unk> 
 i did n't really care about how hateful they were against others because it did n't really affect me in any way 
 that was before <unk> happened 
 basically my christian friend and i were working on a project for our <unk> world history class 
 i invited him over to my house thinking nothing could go wrong 
 boy was i wrong 
 immediately after he got to the house my aunt greeted me and asked what the white trash '' was doing here 
 throughout his stay they cursed him in my native language they stopped him and i from getting snacks and made sure he felt <unk> terrible during his stay 
 now it got personal 
 and how perfect a time : they had just set the wedding date 
 over the next few weeks i told my friends what i was planning to do and invited one foreign '' as in not indian friend over per week 
 i kept a <unk> not the <unk> in my pocket running at all times 
 keep this up for a few weeks and you 've got yourself some amazing incriminating evidence 
 soon it would be time to <unk> my greatest read : only evil plan ever 
 wedding week rolled around and soon it was time 
 i 'd prepared a short paragraph and then a video showing their <unk> 
 my turn came to speak i said my paragraph and i showed the video to the <unk> family 
 the video started and ended and as i saw their <unk> drop lower and lower my grin grew <unk> and <unk> 
 at the end i <unk> laughed and my parents took me home 
 i 'm pretty sure they beat the shit outta me once we got home but i do n't really care for that part 
 tl dr my aunt was a bitch to my <unk> friends with her husband then boyfriend i take recordings of her bitching <unk> it into a video and show it at her <unk> post ever 
 i 'm not exactly a <unk> so please be kind 
 this story starts off about 12 years ago in high school 
 <unk> me dated this girl for a year and a half 
 first love and all 
 anyways she was in the grade above me so when she graduated shit started getting weird with her 
 she became very <unk> and distant 
 i kind of knew something was up but was n't sure 
 one time after a shower she asked me to grab her some clothes out of her <unk> so i obliged 
 there was a note in her underwear drawer it was high school from this dude in one of my classes that basically just said how stupid i was and he could n't wait for her to break up with me 
 well i lost my shit and confronted her and she folded 
 we broke up that day and did n't really speak for a long time her brother and sister and i were kind of close 
 fast forward 4 years and she 's still with the dude which at that point i 'm fine with 
 i 've moved out of town they 'd moved out of town there 's nothing connecting us 
 one day out of the blue she texts me and says that her and dude are having some problems and she 's in town and wants to meet up and talk 
 well talk turned into some pretty rough angry sex and she told me that she did n't think it was going to work out with dude and she wanted to get back together 
 i told keep that she needed to call him and break it off first 
 she did so with some <unk> and tears 
 i made sure she said it was because her and i were getting back together 
 he seemed <unk> 
 it had to be hard because all of her stuff minus the clothes on my floor were at their place but she went through with it 
 after drying her tears she looks me in the eyes and says that she 's happy we can start over and be together again 
 i straight up tell to get the fuck out of my house and never come back 
 i literally push her into the hall she 's still in basically nothing while she 's crying and completely <unk> 
 i could hear her crying as she walked out and slammed the door 
 then watched her get in her car and drive off 
 i 'm not normally a vindictive person 
 i did n't go into it with the plan of doing this and honestly felt horrible about it for the <unk> time 
 <unk> <unk> : ** total subscribers : <unk> subreddit rank : <unk> subreddit growth & amp <unk> : i wish this was my story but alas it is a fellow construction workers 
 see he 's a carpenter in many forms trim framing cabinets <unk> wells you name it the guy builds it 
 well he 's like the rest of us <unk> and does n't take kindly to pushy no pay <unk> 
 he built a very fine very elaborate <unk> well for a massive home almost <unk> <unk> 
 lo and behold pushy no pay builder who i quote said i 've been building houses longer than you 've been alive '' aka dad handed me a job and i fly with it flat refuses to pay for my friends quality work 
 taken aback my friend eats it for a few days and then does the <unk> 
 he <unk> the whole <unk> well not in a nice way either with <unk> and <unk> man anger 
 needless to say he did n't get paid but he did n't get sued either so take that no pay <unk> 5 years ago a friend of mine was being bullied online by her boyfriend 's ex and her friends 
 they were commenting on her appearance calling her a slut basically typical mean girl comments 
 they were really going after her and a friend who was tried to defend her 
 literally an entire thread of insults and hate 
 the girl who was posting most of the insults we can call her <unk> '' was a friend of mine until she did something similar to me 
 after watching this <unk> of hate unfold for about 2 days yours truly decided to step in and try to end it 
 i was moving out of state in a few weeks anyways so i really was n't worried how i would be perceived by anyone in my town anyways so i really let all these girls know exactly what i thought of them 
 basically i called everyone who insulted my friend out on their personality <unk> 
 i went the extra mile with <unk> however telling her she would probably never do anything <unk> with her life 
 i told her you will probably end up staying in my town for the rest of your life working the same or some similar crappy job she was a server because you do n't bring any other value to society other than petty drama '' 
 a little harsh i know but i did n't care 
 it needed to be said 
 fast forward to this weekend when i came to visit some friends 
 we decided to go out for dinner before we start the night time <unk> 
 when we arrived at the <unk> guess who is going to be our server this evening 
 the look of shame on her face was enough for me to know that karma does exist 
 i did n't say much to her certainly nothing mean this time but she was being very passive-aggressive towards me 
 when it was time to pay the bill i signed my receipt and left a small note at the bottom that said do n't you just hate that i was right 
 so did anyone see the art <unk> freak out video 
 it might be faked but that sort of thing really does happen 
 i used to be an art student computer <unk> at a stupid expensive art school and i 've experienced a freak out much worse than that first hand 
 art <unk> story time if you want it : have you all seen the <unk> commercial 
 so to sum that up the women in that commercial describe themselves as <unk> than they really are 
 the artists draws their description and they leave 
 another person comes in and <unk> the same woman with more accurate detail usually much <unk> than the woman describing herself 
 well there was this girl in my first drawing class who had the opposite problem 
 she 'd draw really well <unk> self <unk> of herself much <unk> and better looking 
 which is fine normally but she also <unk> major features like <unk> the drawing had big thick ones while she had none and <unk> lips hers were very thin she looked a lot more like a relative of the honey <unk> <unk> family + red hair 
 again it 's totally fine if that 's how she wants to see herself no one commented on it for a long time 
 but the problem with her she would point out to many other girls your <unk> look a bit thin in your drawing i think you should have drawn your jaw line <unk> '' 
 just <unk> and <unk> remarks 
 the professor would point out that other people 's <unk> had less issues than she was pointing out 
 she kept <unk> him though 
 i 'm still convinced that the prof decided to get his revenge on the final assignment 
 the final would be a fully finished self <unk> 
 if the class couldn’t tell who the <unk> belonged to it couldn’t get more than a c it was 50 % of our final grade 
 over the class her <unk> had been becoming more and more <unk> not <unk> her or anyone that could even be related to her 
 the final <unk> <unk> were due and they were handed in a pile 
 the prof picked them up and placed them on the wall 
 most of them were easily <unk> except for hers 
 it was a <unk> that looked like <unk> <unk> 
 the guy next to me said “i didn’t know <unk> <unk> was in the <unk> 
 i don’t think anyone honestly even knew it was honey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 the features had <unk> so much from her last homework it was sort of unexpected 
 so the prof asked <unk> is this ” 
 honey <unk> <unk> stood up with this shit eating grin to announce it was hers 
 he opened the floor to <unk> and reminded us for the first time ever that our <unk> grade will be <unk> based on our ability to <unk> <unk> finals 
 meaning we had to lay into her or watch our grades suffer 
 we had to say what he wanted to but would get in trouble for 
 it took the whole class verbally laying into her <unk> for 30 minutes before she broke down started <unk> out at some of the more attractive girls in the classroom for putting so much pressure on her for just existing apparently 
 eventually several people started attacking her back until one person called her fat and she lost it objectively she was fat 
 she cried and cried but didn’t want to give up the <unk> 
 she just stood there <unk> and <unk> in all the negative attention 
 sort of funny to note the guys in the room backed off as soon as she started crying i think the girls saw through her bullshit and kept up the defense 
 the professor just sat there with the best poker face i have ever seen in my life 
 the professor ended the last class early since she would n't do the sensible thing and just leave 
 it sort of sucked since i did n't get a <unk> on my final but it was worth the show 
 she ended up getting a c in the class i think despite her <unk> all being really well <unk> 
 **tl dr - honey <unk> <unk> keeps drawing herself like a <unk> 
 she’s difficult with everyone in the class during <unk> 
 professor gets the class to <unk> her final self <unk> as hard as she 's been <unk> everyone else 
 she <unk> when class <unk> turns on her 
 ** edit : so someone figured out my personal information through stalking my reddit account and threatened to use it to get me fired 
 it looks like i 'll have to delete this 
 so long reddit account of 4 years 
 wife and i are with her sister who totally fucked her over on an $ 800 phone bill 
 we 're parking in <unk> <unk> and she asks if it 's cool to park there because she 's too lazy or stupid to read the sign 
 it was n't cool to park there 
 wife says yeah you 're totally good '' 
 knowing full well ... nope 
 not only did sister get a ticket but got a boot too due to more unpaid tickets like bills 
 i had driven myself and made an excuse as to why i could n't give her sister a ride 
 this status showed up in my <unk> 
 basically he got up to do something and was logged out of the public computer he was using and lost a lot of <unk> work 
 his retaliation was a little over the top in my opinion ... what do you think 
 <unk> as any normal person i dealt with some bullying coming through elementary and middle school 
 in high school this <unk> as i was relatively new to the area 
 i remember one <unk> <unk> made it his duty to torment me 
 he would trip me in the hallway <unk> me and he even <unk> my posters when i ran for student council 
 this bullying culminated one day when he threatened me with a bb gun 
 he stupidly brought it to school and <unk> himself with shooting the walls in one of the regular student hang outs 
 at the time i had thought nothing of it 
 eventually he began <unk> the gun at students and firing so bb 's would bounce of the walls and hit them 
 soon enough he targeted me 
 i was not having it that day 
 i had just lost the <unk> and i placed my student council loss on him and his <unk> friends 
 i asked him to stop but he continued to fire bb 's near my legs 
 things escalated quickly as i literally stood up to him 
 one of my friend 's tried to pull me back saying he 's just an asshole man let 's just go '' 
 i could n't deal 
 i *told* him to stop 
 he <unk> for a moment then aimed the gun at my face 
 he had a female friend beside him 
 she tried to settle him down and pleaded with him to stop he did n't do anything <unk> stop it '' 
 i remember his smug face in detail as he held that bb gun on me 
 he asked me why do n't you make me '' 
 i had no good response 
 i thought to myself you messed up man here was your moment to stand up to him and you 've got nothing '' 
 at the last second i said why do n't you shoot me then pussy '' 
 he smiled as a i stood there and raised the bb gun back on me 
 i did n't even think about moving 
 then <unk> 
 he <unk> out 
 his female <unk> got up to leave and he followed 
 i had won this round 
 **the revenge** it was a few weeks on when my dad & amp i pulled into our local gas station to fuel up 
 dad <unk> off the fuel cap grabbed the pump handle and <unk> to begin filling but nothing <unk> these were days when we <unk> from <unk> to <unk> 
 then i heard a familiar voice over the gas station pa system hey guys that 's not how it works anymore you have to come in '' 
 this was said in perhaps the <unk> tone i have ever heard in my life so far 
 as we walk in i see that it is <unk> and i immediately <unk> a plan 
 that night i went to a 24/7 walmart and bought spray paint and gloves with some cash 
 i do n't even know why they let that slide 
 i was still under 18 at the time 
 i dressed in a black <unk> when i got home and <unk> over to the gas station 
 it was closed 
 all over the clean white paint of the building i wrote <unk> 's name 
 not just his first name his full name 
 first middle and last 
 i wrote it on the front of the building the back of the building and the sides 
 i wrote it in <unk> and in regular script 
 <unk> was <unk> 
 i felt some regret about it when i had got home but i stopped <unk> when i thought of who i retaliated against 
 **the <unk> <unk> lost his job 
 we were even 
 he did n't even bother me anymore 
 i do n't think he ever suspected me 
 a couple days later my spray paint art was covered with some <unk> 
 <unk> things got better as high school went on 
 i made a bunch of friends and was <unk> to student council the next year 
 i guess you need to prove your <unk> when you move to a small town 
 **edit : in the future i will be <unk> of others when plotting revenge 
 in the end i think my act caused very little collateral damage 
 a gallon of white exterior paint costs <unk> $ 
 i 'd just hope that they got <unk> to paint over my <unk> himself before they let him go 
 ** sorry for the wall of text 
 there will be a tldr at the bottom 
 <unk> it was the summer after i finished fourth grade 
 i was at my <unk> 6 days a week because my parents both worked full time 
 there was a kid that liked to physically abuse me and all the other kids at the <unk> 
 he was definitely a troubled kid 
 he had <unk> and took meds daily for it i asked the teachers why he took meds everyday and it was explained to me 
 during the summers his parents would let him skip taking meds because he acted like a <unk> understandable <unk> 
 while kid was off his meds he would beat on me and others relentlessly 
 he was a year younger than me and 6 inches shorter and i had been going to this <unk> since <unk> so it was expected of me to know not to retaliate to him but rather walk away and rat him out which i did but there is only so much a <unk> aid can do to control a wild child 
 anyway over the years i’ve been around this kid i had received bruised ribs and one broken one a broken <unk> and minor cuts and <unk> 
 other kids got hurt as well 
 knocked down from trees shoved sand in eyes you <unk> classic little kid bully shit 
 we put up with a lot and this kid only got time out 
 it was obvious every kid hated this little bag of dicks which lead to the <unk> needed to defeat this kid once and for all 
 <unk> <unk> 
 i’m playing in the dirt by myself doing who knows what 
 i’m a bored kid i don’t know wtf i was doing 
 anyways this little shithead comes up to where i’m at and <unk> whatever i was making 
 i get pissed off 
 hey man it was my dirt creation and i’ll be damned is this little fuck will bully me forever 
 i get up and shove him away and say <unk> you dude leave me <unk> 
 heck yea that will teach him 
 the end of my suffering is now 
 the little dickbag runs away 
 i’m victorious 
 i go back to my dirt and begin trying to rebuild whatever it was 
 i hear running behind me 
 i turn my head to see that bastard running at me with <unk> from a <unk> office in his hand 
 i’m fucked 
 he jumps at me and <unk> the <unk> about an inch into my <unk> right though my jeans and leaves them in there and runs off the ultimate winner 
 i cry my parents come and take me to the hospital blah blah blah you know how it goes 
 next day i’m back at <unk> <unk> in a <unk> office for the next 3 weeks till my leg heals enough for me to be able to play around without pain 
 i was not being punished 
 i was there to <unk> 
 during those 3 weeks of what to me seemed to me like punishment my rage grew 
 i will kill this kid 
 he will know real pain when i’m out of this office 
 3 weeks go by and i’m ready for some sweet revenge 
 i plot with my 2 oldest friends to get the teacher distracted from the play area so i can have some one on one time with <unk> son the dickbag if you didn’t figure it out 
 my friends will hop the brick fence while the teacher is watching and run off in different directions 
 my friends like the plan and agree it is worth the punishment to get back at the kid 
 <unk> revenge 
 i’m in the playground so is that little bastard 
 i signal to my friends to execute the plan 
 they jump the fence 
 the teacher watching the play area runs off to go get my friends 
 i’m alone with that <unk> 
 i immediately run at him while he is playing in the sand box 
 i get a good kick right in his face 
 he gets knocked flat 
 damn that was too quick but oh well 
 i won’t beat him while he is down 
 he knew he had it coming 
 i turn around and walk away leaving him to his sobbing 
 victory is <unk> suddenly i fall to the ground 
 that fucker kicked me from behind right in the <unk> dong 
 one of those kicks with the tip of your shoe that just <unk> the balls right to your <unk> 
 i’m fucked 
 i can’t get up 
 he runs off as i <unk> to regain my breath and <unk> 
 as i start to get up defeated that fucking kid comes back with one of those huge push <unk> and proceeds to hit me with the <unk> end not causing much damage but definitely building up my rage and adrenaline 
 after a couple <unk> i stop his next swing and punch in right in the <unk> 
 i broke his nose i heard it and it was later confirmed to me 
 blood on my hands and him sobbing and bleeding on the ground 
 i’ll be damned if he gets up this time 
 i run off and grab one of those big wheel <unk> lift it over my head and deliver the most powerful <unk> smash a 4th grader could deliver 
 the little fuck goes <unk> and begins doing that loud <unk> 
 the teacher is back with my friends to find a bloody little shithead on the ground and me standing over him victorious 
 proud of what i’ve done 
 i gladly get taken to the office to be <unk> and have my parents called to take me home 
 my dad arrives hears the story from the teachers threatens me with the worst belt <unk> i’ve ever had and takes me home 
 as soon as we get inside the car he turns to me and says in the most serious tone <unk> you learned to defend yourself 
 this is the only time i will not punish you for <unk> i respond with silence and just stare at my feet 
 my dad then says with the biggest smile <unk> damned you kicked the shit <unk> that kid though huh ” the parents never brought that kid back to <unk> 
 i returned as a king of the playground 
 tldr : kid abused me for years eventually <unk> me with <unk> sending me to the hospital 
 i kick the shit out of him and <unk> him with a <unk> 
 edit : <unk> story is fairly recent last summer to be precise 
 i went up to a big name college to take some summer courses and the college gave me an apartment with three other people taking the same classes 
 i got along really well with two of them lets call them jeff and mark but the third one we will call john was constantly getting on my nerves 
 let me explain the living situation to get a better understanding there are two bedrooms a shared kitchen bathroom and living room 
 my real roommate was john 
 we got along fine at first but he never understood basic common courtesy things like not staying up till 2am with all the lights on watching tv while your roommate is trying to sleep 
 this happened more than once i needed to wake up at 6 to make my lab time 
 i would find myself kicking him out of the room and he acted like i was the bad guy 
 after a while we got a <unk> list together so the house would be somewhat clean and no one was doing more than someone else 
 it was all fair and on paper it worked 
 the list was mostly rules on doing the dishes 
 you use it you clean it 
 if you did n't clean it which would happen to us all you just clean the sink out once a day and it <unk> between the four of us unless the dishes were n't yours at all 
 simple right 
 not for john 
 he would never wash his dishes and used double the dishes as the rest of the house 
 so what happened when it was his turn to clean the sink out 
 he just did n't do it saying he has too much work do to his classes 
 that was the biggest bullshit we have ever heard we all have the same classes there is no difference whatsoever 
 we could still find time to clean and work on projects 
 giving him the benefit of the doubt i believed him thinking that maybe it takes him longer to get homework done 
 this was not the case seeing how far he was with the homework i found him watching tv books unopened and work not even started 
 this is an hour after asking him to do the dishes 
 so he clearly had enough time and then some because he never even started his homework that night and just played xbox and watched tv 
 the rest of us went home for break and left his dishes in the sink hoping he would finally pull his weight 
 we were surprised when we got back to find them done but soon learned he did n't do them his mother did 
 his parents live 3 hours from the college and she came up to visit but instead cleaned his mess 
 he is 21 by the way and his mother was still picking up after him 
 we could n't believe it 
 weeks pass and jeff mark and i never left any dishes in the sink because we were tired of the mess and how disgusting it looked 
 but john did n't care he still left <unk> dishes in it 
 within a week it was filled with john 's crap to the point where it was unusable 
 we had it we told him we would stop driving him to class if he did n't clean his share 
 he did n't and had to walk to class for a couple of days 
 no progress 
 i changed the password on my router so he could n't use it and be without internet all homework and projects must be submitted online 
 still he did n't care 
 then we gathered all of his dishes and put them in a garbage bag and threw it on his bed hoping he would get the hint 
 still being <unk> asshat he was he did not clean them 
 the crap then soaked through the bag and onto his bed 
 this then made him clean them 
 this took 5 weeks for him to finally pull his weight 
 from then on we just had to mention a garbage bag and he would suddenly find time to do his chores 
 tl : dr roommate never cleaned his dishes dishes found a new home in his <unk> do n't post on this sub however i usually quite enjoy the stories 
 i could n't find a better place to put this so here 's the flip side of the coin of revenge 
 so a couple days ago i had a friend over 
 we 've known each other since high school but we 've only ever just been friends 
 she and i decided to hang out at my place and it was fun 
 the next day i wake up to my car covered in spray paint 
 like hood roof lights doors windows fucking grill everything 
 now i used to have some enemies but i 've long since grown up and become a chill dude so i could n't imagine why someone would do this 
 the writing said : do n't touch her '' i 'll kill you '' seriously '' so i was concerned enough to call the cops 
 they show up i fill some shit out and we find the spray can thrown into the bushes near the car 
 as the officer and i are discussing possible suspects or lack of we are approached by a nice old lady 
 she asks me are you the owner of this vehicle '' 
 to which i admitted 
 she asked me if i knew a <unk> name changed because <unk> 
 and i run over to my car 
 there it was in huge white <unk> <unk> '' and then it clicked 
 she had broken up with her ex a month ago and it turns out he lives down my street 
 he must have seen us getting in and out of my car when she came over and decided in his infinite wisdom to fuck with my life 
 i text <unk> and it turns out she received a text the night before that was from her ex 
 it appeared at first glance to be a pic of him with cum on his chest but upon closer inspection we noticed it was bright white and <unk> as fuck 
 paint ... he had fucking paint on his chest 
 so now because some piece of shit 30 year old <unk> thought i was seeing his <unk> i deserved a new paint job i have to deal with potentially thousands of dollars in damages 
 here are pics for proof here and here i do n't think this post breaks the rules however if it does let me know 
 if anyone cares about the current status of the case : the warrant for his arrest is supposed to be <unk> today 
 i get a free 250 meter restraining order and if i see this piece of shit in person i 'm breaking both his arms : d. update : i fucking cleaned my car 
 this happens again i 'm blinding him with <unk> 
 so here 's my car now and now and now i 'm so fucking done with this 
 i 'm a big guy 
 not huge but strong 
 but this story takes place in <unk> grade football 
 at the time i was roughly 5 9 '' and <unk> lbs and i would routinely go up against <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 i played left tackle and win 
 this story took place during one of the last games of the season before the <unk> 
 the team i was on was the <unk> and lets say i played against the <unk> 
 the half back from the <unk> was a total douche i knew from school 
 he was the most popular player on their team because he was a good player and would relentlessly harass anyone who was n't good enough 
 you know the type 
 he was a dick to everyone <unk> <unk> teachers parents girls boys and thought the world owes him everything 
 now during the <unk> game the <unk> were losing very badly 
 i 'm talking <unk> in the fourth quarter 
 the situation was utterly hopeless and our coach told us that we had a good game and to not feel bad for ourselves 
 so yeah we were <unk> 
 the last thing any of us wanted to do was go back out and get destroyed another play but we were in our own 10 yard zone and nobody wanted the score to get any worse 
 we <unk> over get set and the <unk> run a new trick play 
 in the last quarter with absolutely no hope of being <unk> on a team whose already given up 
 dick move in the first place right 
 they get a <unk> and the crowd goes wild except for our parents who are just shouting good job at this point 
 and i 've been tripped in the <unk> that is the line which is not normal because normally i 'm standing over the other guy helping him up 
 i was a weird football player 
 well guess who carried the ball for this <unk> 
 that 's right <unk> the <unk> 
 he stands up 
 he spikes the ball and he screams his best victory screech 
 i look over at the <unk> and <unk> kicks me in the back of the head 
 it was not an accident because he 's staring at me smiling 
 i 'm pissed 
 i yell for the ref saying that this idiot just kicked me in the head kick him out of the game 
 he just says he did n't see it sorry 
 <unk> laughs at me and we go to the <unk> 
 <unk> end up actually <unk> within 4 mins of game time after this incident 
 forgot to mention it 
 after we score it 's time for another <unk> 
 i line up the <unk> starts and my friend the kicker launches it up into space giving me plenty of time to get underneath the ball 
 i 'm sprinting as fast as i can at the kid that just caught the <unk> 
 because the football god was on my side that night <unk> was about to catch the ball 
 i sprint at the little fucker as fast as i can 
 i avoid the first line of defense <unk> of <unk> 
 leaning into the hit and dropping my shoulder gets me through the second line of defense and <unk> gets me around the third 
 i pour on speed and anger of the entire night waiting for him to catch the ball 
 <unk> gets it and he <unk> to the right not seeing the little ball of hate that is speeding towards him as fast as <unk> possible 
 i saw through his helmet that smug little smile of his from catching the ball turn to a look of horror as he catches sight of me 
 <unk> plants his foot and <unk> in fear trying to protect the ball from the purple jersey in front of him 
 it 's too late i launch from a full <unk> sprint straight through the air with my shoulders at his chest and my helmet aimed at the ball 
 my metal face guard caught his hand 
 it was <unk> between a football and two sprinting football players connecting at 20+ mph 
 he does a <unk> landing on his head 
 i slide over him and not so <unk> <unk> across the <unk> behind him 
 i saw stars 
 i turn around and he 's dropped the football <unk> up in pain holding his arm 
 the <unk> come out on the field the games stopped and the ambulance is called 
 he 's crying on the field in front of half the middle school i attended 
 he 's humiliated 
 later that night i learn that i connected with him so hard so perfectly that i shattered 7 bones in his hand 
 and i slept like a king 
 edit : forgot to mention it was later in the game 
 they scored 4th quarter we drove ball back and this was next <unk> do n't know if this should go under /r/justiceporn or /r/pettyrevenge i 'll let you decide 
 i own and operate a delivery service delivery hot <unk> furniture and pool tables 
 i 've been doing about <unk> years or so 
 like any job it has its ups and downs and more than a fair share of <unk> 
 there were <unk> frequently between me and the stores i delivered for employees and assistants i 've hired and customers who 've hired me through the years 
 this is a tale of a bitch 
 a drugged out <unk> <unk> bitch 
 it was four years ago i was doing a pool table setup near <unk> <unk> followed by a hot tub delivery between <unk> <unk> and the <unk> 
 as per normal i had to collect a <unk> amount of money from these customers which had to be dropped off at the business that hired me at the lake of the <unk> 
 i finished my last job around <unk> <unk> and arrived at the business to drop off my collections around 8 <unk> the store knowing how <unk> i was toward them asked if i 'd be interested in delivering a really light <unk> to a town up the road 
 they told me it was ten miles away turned out to be thirty so i was a little irritated by the delay and it being in a fairly remote area near the lake i ended up spending extra time trying to locate it after dark 
 i was n't happy considering the fact i still had a two hour drive ahead of me before arriving home 
 i end up finding the place 
 i knock on the door and discover that i 've delivered during dinner time for the people 
 i apologize for how long it took to find them and asked if they 'd like the <unk> deposited in the living room or the garage 
 the man tells me neither and informs me that it has to go down stairs in the sun room 
 he shows me the stairs at which point i inform him that the delivery was a first room of the house or garage delivery a fact they were informed about before i left the store 
 the man is hostile when i tell him this and says he is n't accepting the delivery unless i put it in the sun room 
 i inform him again that it is a garage or living room delivery no stairs 
 i also inform him that it will never fit down the stairs no matter what 
 it is at this point that he leads me over to the side of his house and tells me that i 'll have to carry it down the side or i can take it back to the store 
 i 'm used to this <unk> and any other day it might have worked but i made a lot of money off my first two deliveries and i was n't making very much off the <unk> delivery so i 'm more than happy to take it back to the store 
 the side of the hill he wanted me to carry <unk> down in the dark was covered in rocks about the size of my head or bigger 
 an extremely dangerous <unk> i refuse to <unk> 
 here 's where it gets ... bizarre 
 i had already taken the <unk> off the truck in <unk> of carrying it into the living room or the garage and it is sitting in the driveway 
 he thinks i 'm <unk> and tells me to take the <unk> back to the store 
 i inform him that 's not a problem but he wo n't be able to pick it up or return it or exchange it until the delivery fee is paid 
 he 's already told me he was n't paying 
 i reach down to grab the <unk> and his wife the woman who bought it jumps on my back and starts <unk> my face 
 she 's <unk> my <unk> and <unk> some pretty deep <unk> in the skin 
 in fact i still have some faint <unk> from these scratches even today 
 i shrug her off where she lands on the <unk> at which point her husband threatens to kick my ass for assaulting his wife 
 he gets in my face cursing at me using every curse word combination he can think of and at this point the red neck in me moves to the <unk> of brain and i stand my ground and promise them that i will plant the next person to touch me in the ground 
 i 'm pissed beyond being professional but still i represent the store in this delivery so i politely '' ask him to have his wife get off the soda 
 by the light of the street lamp i can see that the woman is high as a freaking <unk> 
 her eyes are <unk> her nose is red and i can smell the pot on her and the wine she 'd been drinking 
 she is out of it for the most part 
 he <unk> his wife from the <unk> and i reach down to grab the <unk> again 
 i warn him to control his wife if he cares about her and he calls me a few choice names in reply 
 i mentioned that the <unk> was really light so i usually just pick this model up and throw it on my shoulder and carry it where it needs to go 
 this time was no different except for the crazy chick 
 i reached down to grab it again and the woman tried to jump on my back again much to the protest of her husband 
 i had anticipated her doing this again and quickly snatched the <unk> the driveway and <unk> over to the truck 
 she missed me completely and landed face first on the <unk> fucking up her grill <unk> 
 i mean she messed herself up <unk> 
 she did n't stop her self with her hands before she hit 
 she just <unk> into the <unk> like she was <unk> into a pool 
 the man gets pissed and takes a swing at me 
 i step back from him and move toward the front of my truck 
 i do this two more times with his swings going wide each time 
 i did n't want to fight if i could help it so i just kept backing out of range and in doing so i was stepping into frame for the driving cam i used to have in the cab of my truck 
 he tried hitting me about six more times until his wife 's crying forced him to <unk> his attempt at assault 
 i secured the <unk> why he tended to his wife 
 i was parked on the street because his driveway was pretty <unk> and i had a hot tub trailer attached 
 he told me i better not try using his driveway to turn around or he 'd drag me out of my truck and beat my ass 
 i inform him that the <unk> because of the late hour will be taken back to my shop and would not be released until to the store or him until the delivery fee was paid 
 he told me he 'd be filing assault charges against me for what i did to his wife 
 i showed him my camera and said please do because i had it on film 
 i did n't 
 realized on the ride home that the camera had n't been on 
 as i was backing up the street because they lived on a dead end street my trailer <unk> into a dead snag 
 after pulling forward and back several times i was able to back it up the hill and around the curve into the regular street again 
 it was at this point that i noticed that part of one of the <unk> in the dead <unk> had broken lose and landed on the shoulder of the road which gave me an idea 
 i back the trailer into the dead snag a couple of times and the top of the tree broke off and blocked about two <unk> of the street 
 i got out and with a little <unk> and <unk> i was able to pull the tree top across the street enough to block their <unk> their block 
 it cost me a <unk> on the trailer but it was worth it 
 the sweet justice in this was that my shop that i was storing the <unk> in was two hours away in <unk> 
 when they finally contacted the store and i explained everything to them the store backed me up and returned their money minus the money for the two hour delivery i charged for taking it to <unk> with me 
 well that was my tale of <unk> revenge 
 hope you liked it 
 tl/dr asshole and crazy chick received sweet karma after assaulting me during <unk> i 'll start by saying that i am a jr. ref at my local <unk> field which i will not name just for the fact that it is going to court 
 anyway i 'm 16 but a very respected and aggressive player 
 so it begins with us playing a game where you have a certain path to follow and along the path their are key <unk> buildings that you must <unk> to move your spawn closer to keep pushing up 
 anywho the next building we have to get is fairly large with three windows facing us one window on each side of the door 
 no ones pushing on our team so i decide to start it and ask for covering fire and run up to the side of the building their were no guns shooting out of the windows at the time this is important later so the doors on the far right side of the building i 'm on the middle left i go to clear and shoot the guy in the right window with my shotgun 
 i move on to the left one and see a kid <unk> facing the other way 
 i shoot him and then a person in the <unk> that i <unk> see shoots me in my plate <unk> with his <unk> point blank <unk> engagement for <unk> alright not too big of a deal it happens to me a lot because i tend to scare a lot of people do they act on their <unk> i <unk> that is against the rule to shoot me so close with the <unk> 
 he starts <unk> on about how i can shoot people so close but he ca n't <unk> and how i did n't call my hits when i ran to the building no one was even shooting when i ran i tell him that i 'll call the hit as long as he does 
 he says <unk> and turns like he 's going to walk away but in a split second he turns points his <unk> at my face and sends 5 <unk> burst point blank directly to my face 
 two getting caught by my glasses two getting caught by my <unk> and one hitting my ear causing bleeding 
 i point him out to the ref and what not 
 he talks to the owner then i get brought in for him to apologized an i told him i do not accept your apology on the grounds that you could have blinded me <unk> me taken a tooth out 
 you assaulted me because you did not follow the rules because you decide to be an <unk> <unk> who could have ruined my entire future as a functioning human and you are oh so lucky i 'm not <unk> you '' the owner said it was my call weather he gets banned or not at first i told him to not let him back for a while 
 then his friends who were a table away from us started being dicks to my friends and i. so i let the owner know that i wish for him and his friends to never be allowed back 
 and during this time the dude threatened a <unk> colonel do n't know for sure other than he 's a colonel that he was going to shoot him with a real gun 
 he did n't say it directly to him but to his friends and their were many witnesses 
 so now because of that he his now being reported because of the threat and i 'm now in the process of getting him assault charges 
 btw this dudes 21 i 'm 16. things <unk> going to be well for him for a <unk> years ago a major <unk> blew through my hometown and the government issued a damage repair to all houses <unk> by the storm after <unk> through insurance companies something to that extent 
 construction contractors took advantage of the situation going door to door offering their services 
 contractors get money everyone gets free repairs why not 
 whole <unk> signed on and work began 
 my parents were getting their home repaired and after a time realized the amount they were <unk> for was too high so they planned to break the contract and find someone else to do all the repairs and replace all the <unk> and window framing for the same price 
 while on the phone with the contractor he tells them they 're willing to to do all the extra work for free so my parents stay with the original contractors 
 after many many months the work was done and the guys came to collect except they did n't replace the <unk> and window framing 
 my father <unk> the money because they admit to lying about the extra work in order to keep the contract but refuse to do it because they did n't write up the new contract for my dad to sign so they 're not obligated to do it yet wanted our money 
 this <unk> into arguments with them threatening to sue us 
 a couple days later after discussing this with the family we have them over for a meeting and agree to pay them extra but <unk> amount to do the <unk> and framing 
 they come back and finish the work 
 when the time came for them to receive their pay they visit the house and my mother gives them the check 
 they realize that the amount was for the original work without the additional pay as agreed 
 they get pissed 
 my mother <unk> replies to them that since they did n't sign a <unk> contract she was not obligated to pay them the extra amount 
 they left without much of a fight 
 tl dr get it on paper 
 this one is an <unk> form of revenge though 
 not from the food server but instead a <unk> <unk> 
 so i 'm out to dinner with some friends 
 and one guy a friend of a friend is being a particular prick 
 as a side note he is known as a real penny <unk> 
 a tight ass so to speak 
 always asking for drinks asking for <unk> 
 and it turns out that this guy has been <unk> our country 's australia welfare system for years 
 i only recently found out 
 so here we are at the restaurant table and he is being racist - talking about hitler and using fake german accents in this <unk> restaurant ... in front of the friendly young <unk> waitress ... he is complaining about the <unk> and generally being rude to this poor waitress who is obviously new to the job a <unk> and just being nice whilst no doubt earning very little and not being tipped much we do n't tip as much as people in the states so i tell him to stop being an asshole but he wo n't listen 
 he continues ... we all as a group <unk> him for being a prick but he continues 
 time passes and later the waitress brings his dinner which consisted of chicken <unk> and <unk> 
 at this point we are all happy because the food is great but of course he then decides to complain and ask the poor waitress to put the <unk> back in the <unk> because they 're not cooked enough '' 
 and to get a new soda because it is <unk> not regular '' we <unk> the soda and all agree he is wrong 
 i 'd had enough 
 pissed off at this guys lack of <unk> most likely due to the fact he has never worked in <unk> - in fact he does n't work at all - he relies on welfare <unk> from the government i decide to seek revenge 
 ... so ... as soon as i got home i wrote a long detailed submission to our welfare system <unk> program 
 it is basically a website where you can anonymously <unk> in welfare cheats 
 he 's <unk> 
 i wrote everything i know about the guy including his <unk> about <unk> money 
 i wrote his name his address his general <unk> o 
 from what i 've heard etc 
 feels <unk> last night i heard a track that reminded me of the story of revenge i 'm about to share with you guys 
 the track is too many <unk> by the <unk> boys and <unk> 
 its a decent cut about <unk> <unk> <unk> other things 
 years ago i did a solid for a friend of a friend 's friend <unk> for some show they were throwing i think they described it as a stop on a regional tour 
 so i start doing some prep work i ask for some of their <unk> and they 're taken aback 
 all they had planned and wanted me to do was play their <unk> they called it an <unk> while they <unk> over themselves <unk> 
 i 'm not sure if i need to explain this or not but this is amateur as fuck and definitely not <unk> 
 at this point i knew it was going to be bad but stuck with it anyway since they said they already sold like 80 tickets 
 it got worse 
 their <unk> despite having decent probably stolen <unk> is <unk> cliche 
 it was full of <unk> that were <unk> lies <unk> but worst of all <unk> and <unk> 
 regardless i work with what i can 
 i figured out some good <unk> with my own <unk> marked some bars i could loop so they could <unk> or work the <unk> pick out some points i can scratch with 
 i was ready 
 a few days later i get to club and set up but there is no sound engineer 
 whatever i work with the house stuff perform checks and get ready stressing out way too much over all this foreign equipment 
 the time comes for their set and for a good hour these losers were holding people at the door trying to make it look like the place was bumping but in reality it was a ghost town 
 probably 6 hours after i had got there the set finally starts for an entire 30 people 
 the first half went as good as it can go when 3 or 4 <unk> are <unk> over the sound of themselves <unk> despite them looking like dear headlights when their tracks did n't end 
 there is a quick <unk> and i decide i 'm getting paid now 
 i knew they did n't make enough at the door to pay my full fee but i was cool with taking a cut 
 they fucked up by offering me a <unk> sum that i ca n't even remember 
 when the second half started i kept working kept up the professionalism but for the last two tracks i had my fun 
 the second to last track i kept my hand on my <unk> 's pitch <unk> 
 i would speed and slow down the track <unk> 
 to anyone listening they probably would n't have noticed but if <unk> singing over your own song for the <unk> time you definitely noticed 
 again i give them a chance to actually be <unk> 's with some <unk> <unk> and again they ca n't do it and i <unk> 
 i queue the last track and think fuck it and change my <unk> to <unk> at 45 <unk> instead of <unk> and guess what 
 those broke clowns stood up there <unk> to an empty house singing about how cool they were <unk> their last track like <unk> 
 i do n't know why they did n't stop maybe they did n't want people to know they were <unk> over their own voices or they were frozen by humiliation 
 do n't fuck over your dj especially if you 're <unk> bankrupt and are a <unk> <unk> 
 passion and <unk> are more important than money but when the money is gone there is no <unk> so some years ago i was about <unk> i think now 26 a friend of mine had a free house so a bunch of guys were gon na head over sink some beers smoke a little play some <unk> etc 
 i had just been offered a permanent position at the temp job i was working so i <unk> going out for a few drinks first to celebrate but the guys were already at the house which was in a different town 
 no biggie me and my brother will head out for a few drinks then hop on a train and come down to the house 
 we do then we pick up a couple more beers at the shop <unk> train ride before heading to the station 
 the train is at the platform but is n't leaving for a good <unk> so we grab a table and continue chatting 
 we 're right at one end of the <unk> sat opposite each other with me in the aisle seat facing down the entire length of the <unk> 
 i see a group of younger people walking down the <unk> towards me 
 a girl then two guys 
 all dressed kinda like scene kids so i do n't pay them any attention ... until the girl without skipping a step walks past and slaps me in the forehead 
 i turn in my chair and start yelling expletives at her along with my brother but she does n't stop 
 just opens the door to the next <unk> and continues through 
 the first guy follows her out but the second guy stops at our table 
 starts running his mouth about <unk> the fuck are you gon na start on a girl and <unk> you want a fucking fight me and my friend will be through there 
 we both try to talk this guy down as we 're peaceful <unk> explain that she slapped me in the face and basically give him the opportunity to walk away 
 but no the tirade of yelling continues - we 'll fuck you up do n't fucking talk to girls like that yadda yadda yadda 
 later conversations with people about this have pretty much confirmed that the guy was on cocaine - firstly because of his mr. invincible attitude and <unk> because of the sizeable chunk of <unk> stuff that had formed in the corner of his mouth 
 in an attempt to <unk> the situation my brother pointed it out and said dude you 've got something on your lip there '' to which we both chuckle ... he responds by <unk> at us 
 remember i said we were peaceful guys 
 yeah line crossed unfortunately 
 we 're also both over six foot tall and i think i 'm about <unk> <unk> - my brother is bigger still 
 we both jump up from our seats and he finds himself face to face with me - i swear i saw him visibly <unk> quite <unk> as he was already a little <unk> 
 i think the <unk> of what he had done finally <unk> in 
 after a quick mental <unk> of ok so you 've stood up he <unk> at you what do we do now '' 
 i leaned backwards and launched my forehead square into his nose 
 blood exploded everywhere and as he <unk> backwards i caught his nose again with a left hook not gon na front my hand hurt for days afterwards 
 but god it was worth it he <unk> into a seat <unk> his face ... while his friend came back into the <unk> to get him shaking in both himself and his voice <unk> profusely for both of his friends 
 as i said we 're peaceful guys so i did n't go for him - i said not to worry cos he had n't done anything but i pointed behind him at the girl and said you should bring her in here see what she 's caused '' we bounced off the train after that 
 managed to get back to our house where my brother 's gf was having a night in with her sister who i had never met before 
 brilliant first impression - explaining the story and then holding out my <unk> <unk> saying that 's his blood '' <unk> college roommates friend was this pot smoking indian dude that was a total <unk> dickbag 
 he would do the most <unk> shit talk behind everyone 's back 
 hit on our girlfriends never buy a round of drinks 
 just a typical <unk> but <unk> yea we smoked out with him 
 go figure 
 anyway heres the revenge story : he took <unk> of pride in his appearance too much <unk> and his parents always gave him money so he could buy fresh gear 
 all of us were having a simple conversation that turned to talking about teeth <unk> 
 he started cracking way too many cold jokes about me and my roommates bad breath in front of these ladies that we just met 
 that night girls ditch us because of his shit talk about some other stuff you just dont say to woman you are interested in a total <unk> 
 it was time for revenge 
 this what we did 
 one night that he was confirmed out of his apartment we smashed the back window of his apartment one night 
 he told us about it and that he thinks someone tried breaking into his place but nothing was stolen 
 he was a bit paranoid and talking all this shit about how he has a gun and will shoot a <unk> 
 etc 
 he is like 90 pounds wet no muscles 
 the seed was planted 
 about a week later he tells us that he went his mailbox and there was an envelope in his box with just a picture of a toothbrush and with magic <unk> remember the date : <unk> '' 
 please note i changed the date it was a date in the future 2 weeks basically '' 
 he made a big deal about this at parties and stuff when we would start a conversation during a <unk> session about weird events or <unk> 
 he would get <unk> to tell everyone this story 
 a week later we put another two pictures in his mailbox : it was a pic of his bathroom with his toothbrush clearly seen hanging there 
 the next pic is the toothbrush handle hanging out the rear end of someone 's very <unk> <unk> 
 yes for two weeks straight we would hang with him : play video games or <unk> go off and take a piss 
 shove his toothbrush up our asses 
 he never found out who did it 
 nor did he ever ask 
 during a <unk> session we brought up our favorite conversation weird things that we seen heard etc 
 it 's his turn to speak up ... since he is not saying anything 
 so we ask him if he has anything to contribute to the conversation 
 he 's like <unk> man i ai n't got nothing '' 
 giggles all around 
 my friend almost lost his shit <unk> but blamed it on the weed 
 <unk> dr version up top : hunter <unk> the revenge porn king was probably relieved when he got arrested 
 *** story at link here but i 'm posting the text below for quicker <unk> 
 <unk> it 's in <unk> then it 's something i <unk> by : <unk> <unk> every day both kids and adults experience online bullying 
 <unk> may be up but unfortunately so are the incidents of harassment 
 how many more <unk> young kids will choose to take their own lives rather than face the insecure bullies who get pleasure from ruining theirs 
 hunter <unk> from the now <unk> <unk> is probably one of the <unk> most notorious offenders 
 hunter is a <unk> bully with a long history of outrageous behavior 
 on abc <unk> he proclaimed to be a <unk> life <unk> when confronted by the village voice about a <unk> fbi investigation against him <unk> stated the following 
 i will literally fucking buy a first class fucking plane ticket right now eat an amazing meal buy a gun in new york and fucking kill whoever said that 
 i will burn down fucking the village voice headquarters if you fucking write anything saying i have an fbi investigation '' 
 and lets not forget about his comment to <unk> during an interview and i quote “i’m gon na sound like the most evil <unk> be real for a second : if somebody killed themselves over being on the site do you know how much money i’d make 
 at the end of the day i do not want anybody to hurt themselves 
 but if they do 
 thank you for the <unk> back in april of this year i convinced hunter to shut down his now infamous <unk> revenge porn website for a <unk> fee 
 hunter was so convincing that he was going to turn over a new <unk> and be an advocate against bullying especially underage bullying 
 within 72 hours of that transaction being complete hunter was on twitter <unk> bullying kids worse than ever before 
 telling kids that they should <unk> <unk> using vulgar racist language and <unk> more violence and revenge 
 i should have known that his attention would eventually turn to me 
 and turn it did 
 <unk> <unk> for attention went on an online rampage accusing me <unk> other things of being a <unk> 
 i was with my wife and two baby boys when his <unk> <unk> came through 
 i <unk> to think what the marine in me might have done if hunter was standing right in front of me 
 but you know what that’s not the right answer violence is a weak medicine when fighting a bully like hunter <unk> 
 i took the high road and didn’t even bother to respond 
 instead of making an anger fueled decision i studied <unk> 
 once i looked for his <unk> they were easy to find # <unk> 
 <unk> world <unk> around his twitter account 
 it was horrifying to see how many of his followers <unk> his <unk> comments with even <unk> ones 
 and then came the straw that broke the <unk> back 
 as if accusing me of <unk> wasn’t bad enough hunter <unk> threatened to rape my wife while my kids watched 
 he has now been served with a <unk> lawsuit and has restraining orders filed against him in two states 
 he can add this to his ever growing criminal record 
 anyone who <unk> <unk> <unk> comments and added their own can also expect to be served with a <unk> lawsuit 
 <unk> tough <unk> are also legally <unk> for their actions 
 hunter and some of his followers now realize this along with their parents since some of his followers appear to be under the age of 18. you would think that hunter would have learned his lesson about receiving naked photos of possibly underage girls on his twitter account or via email after the fbi raided his house actually his <unk> house since he still lives at home he 's 26 but apparently not 
 here at <unk> <unk> decided to turn this darkness into light 
 we’ll soon be <unk> a brand new site for <unk> <unk> did n't seem to come to <unk> that not only shows the history and eventual <unk> of this disturbing website but also brings valuable information to people who have been wronged by similar behavior 
 we are also putting together a class action lawsuit against hunter on behalf of all the victims from <unk> or any other social media that he used to directly harass and intimidate people 
 we’re doing this mostly for the completely powerless underage women who were verbally harassed after hunter posted their completely naked <unk> photos on his site 
 hunter <unk> pissed me off long before he came after me and my family because he picked on those who he thought couldn’t fight back 
 i tried to use <unk> to stop that and i actually <unk> thought it worked 
 now that he’s crossed the line with his personal attacks against me and my family there’s no turning back i wo n't let him 
 i once believed that a <unk> in the military might be a good option to get hunter back on track but unfortunately he became <unk> after his recent arrest for head <unk> a woman in a <unk> in new york 
 and that <unk> up what kind of bully he is 
 he <unk> on those who he <unk> as weak but this time he’s not getting away with it 
 do i have your <unk> attention hunter 
 do you clearly understand what is happening to you right now 
 i’m standing up to a bully and that bully is you 
 sometimes you have to be a bully to beat a bully 
 i’m <unk> the innocence you so <unk> stole from these innocent young girls whose lives <unk> destroyed 
 strong people stand up for themselves but the <unk> people stand up for others 
 i’m really looking forward to seeing you in court as are some of the underage girls who <unk> publicly tormented 
 all of the money that we win from these multiple lawsuits against you will be donated to <unk> <unk> <unk> across the united states 
 let this serve as a constant reminder to you that it’s never right under any <unk> to hit or disrespect a woman 
 now i realize that you don’t have any money but after we win these <unk> against you any money you do earn in the future will go towards this <unk> 
 so you just go right ahead and launch that new website that you keep telling everyone about 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> right hunter 
 your <unk> '' might as well just write a check to our <unk> because that 's exactly where their money will be going when we 're done with you 
 oh and the only thing you have <unk> your beloved social media that’s going away too 
 your <unk> twitter account is going to be shut down shortly – and i’m 100 % responsible for that 
 you see hunter you’re violating the <unk> that i now have in place for <unk> and <unk> 
 you might want to go read the fine print of that contract you signed 
 remember your lifetime ban from facebook 
 well that also includes any other page you try to hide behind including your current <unk> community facebook page say goodbye to that as well 
 by the way hunter when you’re <unk> the completely nude photos of girls are you <unk> that each one of them is at least 18 years of age 
 i didn’t think so add that to your list of problems for today 
 you might want to go <unk> yourself with federal <unk> code 18 <unk> <unk> <unk> and hunter your <unk> about <unk> <unk> between the two of us during the acquisition of your website would be so welcomed 
 assuming you don’t create fake email interactions which <unk> done in the past you will be violating yet again the terms of the agreement which included a <unk> <unk> 
 any <unk> person doesn’t believe a word that comes out of your mouth including the amount you’re claiming to your <unk> and the media that your revenge porn website was purchased for 
 once again hunter you’re on the main stage 
 enjoy yet another 15 minutes of <unk> it will most likely be your last 
 karma is right around the corner <unk> awaiting your arrival 
 this will be the last time i speak to you directly hunter 
 i’m sure you’re going to have some <unk> intelligent public <unk> since you’re a <unk> genius 
 looking forward to you <unk> additional evidence so the world can see for themselves just who you really are 
 as <unk> <unk> once said <unk> is fire and bullying is smoke '' 
 <unk> 's a bit more after this but the end result is the evidence this guy gathered and posted in this article led to a $ <unk> judgement against the hunter <unk> and this was all a while before he was arrested by the <unk> 
 *i grow weed for a living and in this business we tend to hire by <unk> only 
 when i first started i was invited by a friend '' and for the sake of <unk> we 'll call him jason 
 since i had to quit my part-time job quit school and travel out of state for this opportunity jason let me live with him and his girlfriend while he was supposedly showing me the <unk> '' 
 for nearly two years straight i went to work with jason every single day including holidays 
 we would hop into his loud obnoxious <unk> of a car what we were doing was n't exactly legal and drive to each grow site which took anywhere from a few hours up to an entire day if we had to harvest 
 in two years jason taught me nothing 
 he <unk> all the hard work to me and blamed me for anything that went wrong even though we basically had the same responsibilities 
 our boss had already fired a couple of guys because they could n't get along with him 
 i refused to let that happen to me because i knew the <unk> industry was getting bigger and i was determined to get my piece of the pie 
 for two years straight i put up with his shit kept my mouth shut worked incredibly hard and essentially <unk> my life with this asshole while teaching myself how to grow good weed 
 i could go on forever about the things this fucktard did but you get the point 
 luckily my boss was paying attention and offered me a partnership in california where i 'm originally from 
 this was the big <unk> of the <unk> business and my time had come 
 jason was forced to maintain the operation out of state for another six months until he eventually asked for the same deal 
 he was now a partner as well 
 things got out of hand fast for jason 
 his <unk> as a <unk> <unk> were becoming more apparent with each <unk> 
 the <unk> kept getting lower 
 his place always seemed to look <unk> maintained 
 he could n't keep track of what he was doing over the course of several weeks and we would have to figure out <unk> to his problems 
 after another year of this nonsense i decided enough was enough 
 i devised a plan to subtly plant the idea in my partner 's mind that jason was <unk> 
 i told a close friend to keep an eye on him for me and let me know what he does since she hangs out with his girlfriend every now and then 
 i would hear stories about jason going to music <unk> and then <unk> the cost of the tickets not that i really had to since they 're expensive as fuck anyway and i would even suggest that he went partying some nights even when i knew he did n't 
 and with each little drop of poison to jason 's name i added into my partner 's ear there would be a phone call made to jason about progress at work which usually led to a heated conversation about his <unk> to the company and other <unk> 
 i went at this for months until he finally agreed that jason should be kicked out of the business 
 i felt like andy <unk> <unk> <unk> after having just crawled through a <unk> of shit 
 as an added bonus my partner was entitled to half of jason 's equipment after we kicked him out about $ <unk> worth ... all of which was offered to me for free 
 **tl dr** lazy <unk> is a constant pain in the ass while i 'm a lowly employee i become my own boss and start a chain of events that leads to his subsequent unemployment 
 edit : i think i have to remind everyone that it is legal to grow <unk> in california depending on where you live 
 and although <unk> possession and <unk> is still a federal crime i think reddit would agree that those laws will inevitably <unk> was laid off temporarily one winter 
 during my off time i got a phone call from a guy i knew a few years earlier 
 kind of a <unk> but generally harmless 
 he told me he 'd started a <unk> business and had a huge contract and could use any help he could get fast and knew i was off and might want some work 
 he was based out of a city about 70 miles away so he said i could stay with him if i wanted he 's got room 
 so i took him up on it 
 i get there and the guy does n't have a truck and asks if we can use mine 
 his is in the shop '' - total bs he did n't even have one but i did n't know that yet 
 we go to the first house to paint he really did have a contract to paint several houses and he points me to where he 'd like me to start 
 i have <unk> experience and he knows it so i do n't need a lot of supervision 
 but i do n't notice him doing anything at all 
 just going to the bathroom every 15 minutes or so 
 well it becomes obvious pretty fast guy 's got himself a coke problem 
 to the point where he ca n't do any work just got ta <unk> powder all day 
 now i do n't <unk> a man his <unk> coke weed acid alcohol whatever as long as you 're meeting your responsibilities and not dragging down others around you 
 over the next couple of weeks he hired a couple more people who came and went and did n't get paid for their short <unk> 
 but both those people were to be fair absolutely terrible and caused more damage than they were worth so not paying them was reasonable 
 over those couple of weeks when he 'd get good and high he 'd get <unk> as blow tends to do to a person and he 'd let slip how he ca n't have any utilities in his name cause he owes them all hundreds or even thousands of dollars - phone internet electricity water gas even car insurance somehow - the works 
 he 's got a good girl gina at home who 's pretty sick of this shit but is too nice and trying to fix him instead of helping herself 
 so everything 's in her name 
 so a couple of weeks go by i do my work <unk> every day and it 's time to get paid 
 there 's no money to pay me 
 he 's making excuses about how he did n't get some money the customer had promised like i 'm too stupid to see where the money really went 
 anyway i had nothing else to do so i worked another week listening to his promises that i 'd be paid the next friday the end of 3 weeks or work 
 sure enough friday came and there 's no money to pay me but there 's been blow every day for 3 weeks now 
 so i leave 
 i 'm not working for free 
 and for revenge on getting 3 weeks of work out of me for free i sent an anonymous letter to every utility he owed money to telling them where to find him 
 he immediately had <unk> on his doorstep filing <unk> against him for thousands of dollars 
 plus with me not doing any work the customers went from being <unk> with how slowly work was being done to firing him for breach of contract 
 good girl gina had enough and dumped him 
 he had to leave town pretty much immediately 
 he had no vehicle either so packed a bag and hitch <unk> out of town 
 last i heard he was in and out of <unk> still a <unk> about 10 years later and still going from town to town burning bridges and only concerned about his next <unk> i was in fifth grade i was always getting picked on 
 it was bad but there was this one kid he shall be named justin who was a <unk> 
 i would draw trees in class after the lesson was over 
 justin picked up on this and would take to calling me a tree fag 
 he did stuff like this all the time 
 during winter i would wear some cheap green gloves and i was dubbed <unk> fingers 
 i did n't tell the proper authorities because that usually made it worse 
 although i did become friends with the principal 
 i tried to become friends with him and he would <unk> one of those horrible <unk> that smelled like trash juice in my face 
 one day about a week till school was out for summer i had had enough 
 i got one of those wood pencils sharpened it to a point and waited till we were on the way to the bus 
 they had to dig about an inch of pencil lead from his back 
 when the principal had made a show out of taking me to his office he got this look on his face like why 
 and told me to next time punch him 
 i was suspended the next day and no charges were made by the <unk> begin with english is not my first language so be prepared for some silly mistakes 
 second some of my memories of this event is a bit <unk> if there is any questions about how things were i 'll try to explain them 
 the entire event took place in a month but my revenge happened over a weekend 
 this was in the <unk> of <unk> i think 
 i was born 95 and my brother <unk> but since he had skipped a year in elementary school to be with his friends we were in the same age group <unk> we went to the same school we never were the same class 
 it all began in <unk> 
 anyhow facebook had made its great entrance among minors so both of us had facebook accounts 
 at that time i was a social <unk> a anxious <unk> nerd who had a few friends and a perfect target for practical jokes which my brother knew 
 thus i was <unk> '' for those of you who are unfamiliar with <unk> it 's when someone posts <unk> on another persons account its often quite silly and obvious 
 this was not much of a big deal i <unk> '' him back so to teach him a lesson but he did n't learn much from it as i found myself <unk> '' once again 
 this was enough i thought 
 time to end this <unk> but only how 
 that 's when death note makes its appearance 
 it 's an <unk> in great <unk> about two people locked in a battle of <unk> 
 as i watched it all became clear for me 
 i now knew how i was going to get my revenge 
 i was going to out <unk> him so greatly that he would not dare to mess with my facebook again 
 the first step in the plan was to get access to my brothers facebook account so i was in need of his e-mail and his password 
 i got the perfect opportunity for this when we one friday were at our grandparents place he wanted to check his facebook on their computer so i simply <unk> his password easy 
 his e-mail would need some <unk> 
 i asked him if he could help me install the e-mail feature in my ipod after some arguing i got him to use his e-mail to unlock it apparently my e-mail did n't work '' now for the <unk> 
 i asked my brother for a good movie to <unk> he happily <unk> me to <unk> the movie x and he also included the websites y where i could <unk> it 
 now i had everything i needed 
 as soon as i were alone i logged into his facebook form my ipod good thing they had wifi there 
 there i wrote something like this : hello <unk> last name 
 thank you for <unk> movie x from website <unk> i am now in full <unk> of your computer 
 love from <unk> '' 
 this was not the actual message but i made some <unk> spelling and grammar mistakes to make the <unk> more <unk> 
 after i wrote this on my ipod i logged him out and logged into facebook with my own account 
 i <unk> down to my own message made a poorly acted chuckle and showed it to my brother 
 <unk> to say he was freaked out 
 he instantly went onto the computer and deleted the message sadly 
 the good thing was that he did n't change the password he decided that he would do that when we came home 
 since i still could <unk> his account i kept my poor <unk> and let a half hour go by 
 then i wrote something like this : <unk> last name why would you remove my last message 
 i just want to get along 
 you really hurt my feelings do you really have to be this mean '' 
 waited and showed him 
 he got stressed and deleted the message and told our mom that we should go home asap 
 two birds with one stone 
 once at home my brother immediately changed the password which i had feared 
 this was his great <unk> the password he now had was quite strange so strange that he wrote it on a paper to remember it a paper i <unk> could take a peek at 
 my brother searched for viruses <unk> the computer and other stuff as well as he <unk> with his account 
 i locked myself inside my room this was ordinary practice for me and my family allowed a teenager have that privacy 
 in my room i could barely contain my excitement 
 i wasted no time to create a fake <unk> 
 the name of the man would obviously be <unk> there 's not a single more french name then that 
 i then checked for normal <unk> 
 i decided with <unk> the third most normal surname in case my brother would search for this man 
 then i looked for pictures of french men as usually i took several steps to make him more <unk> 
 meanwhile some of my brothers classmates had picked up what was happening to my brother and asked things like : hey <unk> you there '' 
 on my brothers profile 
 i was quite close to dying in my attempts to not tell anyone who the <unk> really were 
 later that night i snuck into my brothers room and got the password this was when the turd would hit the fan 
 i changed his entire profile where <unk> lived where he went to school changed his profile picture and so on 
 oh and <unk> was furious : mr last name i have had <unk> of you 
 do you really think that <unk> searching for viruses and changing the password will stop me 
 i am greatly insulted by you 
 i only sought to be your friend and you treat me like this 
 you really <unk> to be ashamed of yourself 
 no love - <unk> <unk> '' i also replied to his classmates to their great joy 
 forward to the morning and all hell broke loose 
 my brother when <unk> nuts on his computer he changed admin the passwords to the profiles deleted all his movies anything to get rid of <unk> which i mocked him for publicly 
 this went on the entire day he made somewhat <unk> attempts to get rid of <unk> and got his attempts <unk> publicly 
 luckily he did n't try to change his password again i guess he thought <unk> would found it out anyway 
 next day sunday was when the bubble would pop 
 i had to pop it 
 my brother had decided to <unk> his computer he would lose everything on it 
 i thought it would no longer be just about revenge then 
 i revealed myself on my brothers account to <unk> joy 
 my family all burst out laughing when i exposed the truth even my brother was quite amused by it 
 but the greatest thing was how i was received by my school on the monday 
 people whom i did n't even know shouted encouraging things me which was quite of the contrast to my usual day in school 
 the legacy of <unk> still lives on 
 from that monday no one dared to mess with me and whenever my brother threatens to do something to me i calmly <unk> him of the <unk> '' i 'm not sure if this belongs here or not but after having read some of these i think it does 
 so in middle school i was a stereotypical nerd 
 i was in the band did well in my classes etc 
 unfortunately i had a bully as well 
 the guy did all sorts of crap thankfully it never escalated to anything physical 
 long story short he made my life hell for years 
 on of his antics was constantly taking my pencils 
 i knew they were mine and my teachers knew they were mine but we could n't ever get proof 
 so i decided to change that 
 one day i wrote on a piece of paper this is <unk> 's pencil '' 
 i promptly folded it up and stuck it in the pencil 
 i should note i use mechanical pencils 
 anyway per usual he took it 
 when i noticed i asked to see it 
 he said no initially but for some reason eventually let me have it 
 wrong move 
 over his protests i took off the end of the pencil and pulled out the note and then handed it to the teacher 
 he ended up in a fair amount of trouble once the school principal realized that the guy was n't such an angel 
 it felt <unk> a while we 've allowed posts that do n't really involve revenge because we 'd like to be fairly hands off and let people up or <unk> posts according to what they think of the revenge 
 posts that do n't include revenge do generate reports and complaints which we notice but the posts still get <unk> 
 we 're open to changing what 's allowed but we 'd like to know what people really think 
 going off of the <unk> of <unk> to comments it seems the silent majority is content with the <unk> posts and the vocal minority does n't like them 
 obviously the silent majority may not reply here but we 'd like to know what everyone thinks 
 edit : the mods have discussed this and we 'll be <unk> posts more strictly from now on to reflect the rules 
 i 'm not a <unk> 
 i never have been 
 i had a close friend '' we 'll call him black eye back in college who would fight every time he drank 
 more often than not he would be picking fights with his closest friends including me 
 i 'm a happy drunk so i 'm even less violent when having a <unk> old time 
 this story has little to do with him but that 's the friend circle i was in 
 one of them was a beast of a wrestler yet the nicest guy you 'd ever meet 
 they were genuinely good friends but they were really just fun to party with - on the good nights 
 one day him his <unk> friends and i are at the neighbor girls party 
 beer <unk> <unk> chicks alpha males and me 
 the party starts getting rowdy 
 the cops come 
 they id a few people but all is well in the world and they just make people leave 
 no big deal our group walks two doors down to black eye 's apartment 
 three people from the party come as well 
 we 're having fun playing drinking games and whatnot 
 at one point i go to grab my <unk> <unk> from the tv 
 no phone 
 i immediately have a mini heart attack and ask someone to call it 
 i had just been using it 
 the volume is all the way up 
 everyone goes quiet no ring 
 we all know exactly what happened 
 <unk> friends and i run out the front door and continue calling 
 i recall that one of the other guys went out back to call his gf '' 
 we run around the apartment building 
 before turning the corner black eye calls it again 
 sure enough that boring generic samsung <unk> goes off behind his apartment 
 thanks to the light we see it sitting in the grass 15 feet from guy pretending to be on phone 
 as in he literally had his phone up to his ear while the screen was showing the home page 
 we call him out on it 
 come on man 
 free beer and you steal my phone '' 
 he <unk> up completely 
 all he can say is what 
 what '' 
 he did not say another word 
 he just kept freezing and asking what '' 
 <unk> men starts getting in his face 
 i 'm not going to stop anything 
 one more time he <unk> and asks <unk> '' 
 black eye punches him in the face 
 it was so fast and i was <unk> enough that i actually did not see the punch even though i was staring him in the face 
 he does n't move 
 blood <unk> out of his mouth 
 i 'm still not a <unk> and i 'm not close with that circle anymore 
 t was definitely <unk> satisfying to see instant karma though 
 <unk> '' 
 he leaves 
 we go inside 
 one girl realizes her phone is missing too 
 we call it and are happy to hear it ringing in a drawer 
 she swears she did n't put it there why would she 
 we ask the guy 's two friends to leave 
 i fly home that weekend 
 my old buddies told me that all those guys brought a few other guys to come kick their asses 
 this time phone thieves and their buddies get beat 
 you may be under the impression that it 's possible he did n't steal it 
 he was the only person who had left the apartment there was only 7 of us since i put my phone down <unk> minutes before 
 it was him 
 tl dr : someone steals my phone 
 <unk> friend punches him 
 guy tries to bring a <unk> a few nights later 
 they all get beat 
 i do n't like violence but instant karma is a delight to <unk> so i 'm not sure if this is pro enough for you so if it is n't then feel free to tell me and i will put it under petty revenge 
 okay this story starts off when i moved overseas to study in an international college 
 i was staying in the school 's <unk> in my final year however due to my young age the room i was assigned was for really young students and <unk> 
 this was so that the corridor could be watched over by supervisors 
 now i was the only young person '' there everyone else in my sector were <unk> and unfortunately it turns out they pulled some strings so a 3-4 of them were close friends that chose rooms beside each other 
 they were the worst fucking neighbours i ever had 
 every other night meant wall <unk> and sex noises my table would shake and the paper thin plaster walls did not hide anything my neighbour wanted to do 
 without fail every 2 am i would be <unk> by drunken laughter or angry screams 
 walking back to my room was n't easy either 
 they were big older <unk> about 4-5 years older students that were there to literally <unk> classes 
 every day was a new adventure be it dirty piles of laundry left outside their room to <unk> through <unk> bottles of alcohol that <unk> into my room 
 loud drunk people banging on random doors and walls and picking fights with <unk> or even broken chairs and lights left in the corridor to be cleaned up 
 now all this i figured i could live through it was n't a big deal for me exams were pretty far away and i wore <unk> to deal with the noise 
 this all changed in the last few months of my stay there 
 one day i hear the usual laughter and shouting in the room beside me 
 after a while i hear a knock on my door 
 opening it it seems that the door was rigged so that upon opening it a bottle of piss would tip over and drain into my room 
 cue fast hands and panic as i desperately grabbed the bottle and stopped about half of it from spilling 
 i spend the next 30 mins cleaning myself and hands but the piss smell was terrible 
 it seemed that this prank '' was planned for a long time because the <unk> was painful to breathe in 
 after cleaning my hands off i took the half empty piss bottle cleaned and <unk> it 
 and set it on my table 
 it was at that moment 
 when my room was smelly as fuck and i knew the it would be so for the next few days until the <unk> came to clean my room 
 it was then did i decide i had enough of his shit 
 so i kept the bottle left it on my table as a constant reminder to the pain i suffered that day the smell sealed inside i began gathering everything i could think of to create the worst revenge imaginable 
 first off was a trip to my friends room 
 my friend was a pretty <unk> guy and often had all sorts of <unk> crap inside his room 
 one of those such things was a mixing bottle 
 the bottle was intended for fresh juice to be <unk> into it but my friend had n't bothered to take a 3 week old <unk> out from the jar causing it to <unk> 
 i took that 
 next i went online and searched for as many stink 
 i bought some basic stink bombs at first 
 then lady revenge saw my <unk> and a few weeks later i had found out my friend had purchased <unk> acid for shits and giggles online 
 i took that from him too 
 now i did n't want to mix this up too early or my own room would stink 
 unfortunately me waiting too long ruined a part of my revenge 
 of the 4 people that were together 3 of them had left or moved out of the <unk> 
 thus only one was left 
 and he was to be the sole victim of my hatred 
 so the time came and i mixed it all up 
 a few weeks before he and i were to leave we had the same supervisor and i was really friendly with her while he was not leaving it in my toilet which had a really powerful <unk> 
 i let it sit for a few days and all this time i had kept the bottle of piss with me half empty on my table 
 it would be the last piece of my plan 
 now came plan <unk> i was afraid that i might not have time or would chicken out from the main <unk> and since i had spare stink bombs that i had n't used in the final product i decided to go through with plan b anyway 
 <unk> on him i learnt of the times he would leave his laundry in the laundry room or go to dinner 
 i took the extra stink bombs and for three <unk> washes i dropped them in with his washing 
 i like to think that his clothes were fucked from three washes and 2 dry <unk> 
 i would never know 
 so back to the <unk> finally after 2 whole days of <unk> i poured it into the bottle 
 making my own modifications to the bottle i <unk> off the top to allow the entire thing to spill immediately 
 i poured and <unk> 
 god the smell was horrifying ... but so beautiful 
 as i stared at the bottle i knew the time was right he would be stuck in that room for the next few days and there would n't be <unk> around as the holidays were about to begin 
 ironically a few days before the supervisor came to wish me goodbye in advance as she was leaving first and asked me whether my neighbour was a nice neighbour as she also knew he was a <unk> 
 i had told her i had no problem with him and so we left on good terms 
 as a final i would say cherry on top 
 i peed a bit into the bottle as my mark of revenge 
 back to the revenge 
 i placed it at his door but with my own mix i attached the bottle to a piece of string which i strapped to his <unk> upon opening the string would drag the bottle over tipping the entire thing into the room 
 i did my work when i tracked him to be inside the room after his dinner and banged on the door <unk> to get him worked up enough to swing open the door as fast as possible 
 it went better than expected after hiding i heard a loud scream before a slam a sound of the door opening again and then a louder scream 
 i could hear him charge around shouting something in russian before going back to his room 
 success 
 as i approached my room once again the smell hit me lucky for me i was ready a few days before i had borrowed a large fan to be placed in my room from another friend summer hits hard with no ac and so the smell did n't <unk> into my room for long 
 i could see the large stain left all over the floor 
 laughing to myself i went to my room and rested 
 now fast forward a few days later 
 eventually the guy did everything with his room door open to allow the smell out 
 walking past the large stain left behind showed me the damage done 
 the spill had effectively <unk> <unk> fortunately for me and gotten over a whole bundle of his clothes i believe he was packing which he dumped at the foot of his door 
 i would see him walking around looking pissed as hell 
 sometimes if i sat close to him in the <unk> i could still smell the stank <unk> from his skin 
 i guess he was n't that well of a <unk> 
 i <unk> about <unk> of stinky ass liquid into his room <unk> of it was his own piss and very little of mine 
 he stayed in that room for another 2-3 weeks before all of us parted ways 
 my final glee was at the end of everything he came up to me as i was leaving asking to speak with me 
 in broken english he asked if i saw anyone throw the bottle of piss into his room 
 i shrugged my shoulders and feigned <unk> 
 as i loaded my luggage onto the bus i saw him walking to the <unk> so i screamed as the bus passed by the <unk> and left to the airport 
 thanks for the bottle of piss i left it at your door '' 
 i hoped that was enough for him to understand what it meant 
 i like to think it was though probably not since english was n't his first language 
 tl dr russian neighbour makes my life a living hell and the final straw is spilling piss all over me and my room i take what he gave me and threw it back with mine and a bit <unk> did n't do this but one of my guy friends did 
 when i was in high school we had this handicap kid in a wheel chair who thought that just because he was in a wheel chair you could n't touch him 
 he was always in trouble for sexual harassment and shit like that 
 he even <unk> me once in a very disgusting way to which i replied oh <unk> you 'd fall in love and i 'd fall asleep '' 
 he got so mad but did n't try anything else probably because it was common knowledge that if you screwed with me my <unk> would find you 
 well i told one of my guy friends about what he said and he was upset 
 he told some of his guy friends and so on and so forth until they had a group of people who were tired of this kids shit 
 he harassed their <unk> and/or <unk> and talked shit and despite his many many write ups for sexual harassment the school refused to do anything besides send him to <unk> training 
 i guess my complaint was just the straw that broke the <unk> back because the next thing i know they 've done something about him 
 now i have to explain one thing to you 
 our school had a <unk> <unk> which was basically a huge <unk> case with a landing in the middle and <unk> steps on either side of the landing 
 so these guys my friend included corner him in between classes pick him and his wheel chair up put him on this landing and left him 
 he was there for over an hour i think 3 but it i 'm not sure he was there <unk> class changes and not a single person did anything to help him not one 
 a school of over 2,000 students who use that <unk> as their main mod to get from first to second floor and not one person did a damn thing 
 i even walked passed him and laughed then walked away 
 he had to wait until a teacher found him and got other teachers to help get him on solid ground 
 my friends never got in trouble for it i 'm not sure why i think it was because he could n't really identify them by name 
 after that anytime he tried shit all you had to do was say <unk> '' and he 'd go white and shit himself 
 **edit** when i say sexual harassment '' i mean he was notorious for not only making the most disgusting comments but grabbing girls butts <unk> and <unk> yes <unk> slapping their asses lifting their skirts and shirt 
 i mean the <unk> stuff that would have gotten you kicked out but because the school did n't want anyone to get <unk> they <unk> starts in <unk> or <unk> 
 i was in hs and was going with some close girlfriends to a very close guy friends house for new years 
 needless to say lots of drinks and for a <unk> hs kid a whole bottle of jack put me out 
 my then very close male friend <unk> told me i could pass out in his room 
 all was good as <unk> had always been straight with me or so i thought 
 so i went into his room alone and closed the door 
 i was <unk> with quiet and darkness the perfect mix to sleep off the over <unk> of alcohol 
 skip ahead an <unk> amount of hours 
 i start come around to the sound of our mutual friend <unk> yelling through the door 
 dude do n't do this 
 you know this is fucked up 
 just stop you know it 's wrong '' 
 i look up to see what i thought was a close friend <unk> 
 i freaked and pushed him off 
 i tried to pretend it never happened like i do all my problems 
 a few weeks later i find out that <unk> really liked me and it was n't just taking advantage of a drunk girl thing for him 
 that is when i got my plan for revenge however i never would have thought it would be so great 
 <unk> actually had the nerve to ask me out i said yes 
 i went out with him i laughed at his jokes 
 my friends <unk> wtf i was doing i never told any of them that it was all in my plan 
 one day i heard from <unk> 's girlfriend who was my best friend that <unk> had told him he was in love with me 
 that was my <unk> 
 the next night me and <unk> had plans to go out and i had my ultimate revenge ready 
 <unk> shows up to go out 
 i say nothing as i get into the car 
 in the pause he starts crying and says his mom just found out she has 6 months to live that her cancer was far more advanced then they thought 
 i think to myself no fucking way this could play out any better 
 so i look him in the face with no <unk> and tell him i never even liked you we 're done '' 
 i figured this would cause at most some minor hs <unk> and several months of pain 
 it was n't until 15 yrs later that i seen how deep i had cut him 
 we ended up working at the same place and i came to find out he married a girl that looks like me talks like me and has my same name 
 normally the name thing would n't be a big deal if i had a name like amanda or <unk> but i have a <unk> unusual name 
 found out when he got drunk at the company xmas party that he is still in love with me 
 i hope he <unk> around in it until he <unk> fuck him this did n't happen to me but i think the story is too perfect to not share 
 at school i lived in an apartment that 's been passed down in our fraternity so we all know each other and have stories shared from the past 
 well a few years ago one of the roommates was notorious for leaving his dishes in the sink and never doing dishes 
 not a guy my older roommates hated and wanted out just an annoying thing he did 
 well one day they had enough of the shit 
 it was a 4 person apartment 
 the other 3 bought paper plates <unk> <unk> everything and decided to only use those disposable ones 
 they did n't let the 4th roommate know about this 
 well after a couple weeks the sink started getting really filled 
 roommate # 4 came into the living room one day while they were watching tv and said something along the lines of man the sink is really getting filled ... someone should do the dishes '' 
 at which point they made the big reveal that the dishes all could only be his 
 he was pissed for a short bit but it got the point across and it 's a great story <unk> : this is not my revenge and isnt as good as the last one story : this is the same guy as my other post 
 he is a landscaper and he does n't like not getting paid 
 he did some work for a lawyer i think it was around two or three weeks of work and the lawyer was very pleased and got lots of <unk> from his neighbors 
 it was the talk of the street at the time 
 however the lawyer didnt pay up ... revenge : like i have mentioned the landscaper does n't like not getting paid 
 he decided to make a point and show the lawyer up 
 he parked and old <unk> on the guys lawn with a sign saying pay me '' 
 when the lawyer asked what was going on he said me and my family wont be able to pay the mortgage because you wont pay me we are just going to live here with you '' lets just say he got paid the next <unk> a month ago my bike got stolen with lock and all 
 the moment when i walked out of the library i knew there was something wrong because i did n't see any in the <unk> that even <unk> looked like a mountain bike 
 as i was panicking my burger started to fall out of my mouth because of the sheer suprise that someone would steal a bike with 2 locks on it in the middle of the city where everyone can see 
 i asked one of the security <unk> that worked near the place of the crime if he has seen someone stealing a <unk> 
 his answer was something in the lines of this the chance that you will get your bike back is small due to the fact that people steal bikes with locks and just puts in a truck and sells it <unk> or something '' 
 except the fact that guy had a bias view on polish people he seemed like a straight up guy that would n't be bullshitting me 
 i proceed to walks home instead of pressing charges in defeat pondering if i should be an asshole and steal one for myself did n't do it 
 did n't want to that jackass 
 a month passes by and it 's my birthday so the 10th of december in the evening i went to watch the <unk> of the last <unk> movie which in my opinion was way better than the other two as we 're walking from the movie my friend and i roll a <unk> and start smoking as we 're walking home 
 as we turn around the corner into a street that 's usually calm <unk> it 's next to a street that has like 10 bars 
 in the corner of my eyes i can see a shape that looks quite familiar 
 i check it out and there it is 
 my bike in its grace & amp glory 
 i recognized it <unk> cause i had this bike for over 5 years now and it was quite an expensive and <unk> mountain bike that you do n't see that often in my city 
 plus it had the <unk> scratches and <unk> that i was responsible for through the years 
 as i <unk> further i can see that the thief put on a new light a new seat and he got new brakes very nice 
 as i notify my friend we both agree to smoke the jay first and call the cops after 
 but we had one issue the bike was locked and i did n't have proof that it was mine cause you see i got it as a gift from my <unk> and my <unk> got it from a friend of his 
 the <unk> never used it due to the fact that he already had a bike 
 and it would 've been quite helpful if the the <unk> owner was still alive 
 and if you do n't have proof that the bike is yours then you do n't have shit to show to the police 
 as i start panicking my proceeds to call the police to notify them about the situation 
 they will reply with that they will be there <unk> 15 min since it 's not a <unk> matter 
 my friend then calls up his dad 
 who is in a very high position within the police force 
 he tells him the story and tells him exactly what to do in this situation 
 i do n't know what the fuck is going on but he looks quite happy and he does n't tell me shit except that everything will be fine 
 the police came on time and we tell them the situation 
 the police could n't do much since i did n't have proof that it was <unk> they did believe because of how precise i was with mentioning the <unk> and dents in the bike and that i knew everything about the bike model and showed them where i scratched my name in 5 years ago 
 but since i did n't press charges they could n't do much 
 then my friends smile and proceed to tell them this what if we can kill two birds with one stone 
 what if we can proof that the person who locked this bike is not the owner 
 and what if can catch the person at the same time in one <unk> 
 all you have to do is put a lock on the bike and wait for the person to come and as he is coming to pick up the bike which should be between <unk> so around the time we were talking and <unk> when all the bars are closing 
 he will be stunned and <unk> and then you guys will come around the corner and so will we and start questioning him about it 
 and since he ca n't proof it to you guys he must have either stolen the bike or bought it from a thief 
 which is also <unk> thought our law '' the two police officers were quite <unk> with the plan until my friends proceed to call his dad through skype and give the phone to them 
 my friends dad shows proof of who he is and that he agrees with the plan and takes full <unk> for <unk> that will happen after this call 
 both officer agree on his term and then one of them tells them that i should press charges online <unk> now <unk> my phone with the frame number of the bike so that i can use it as proof that it ws mine 
 as we set everything up the moment of truth happens 
 around <unk> a scrawny looking guy comes around the corner wearing a <unk> jeans and some <unk> air max 
 as he is walking up to the bike he stops <unk> and then runs to the bike 
 he is checking it and then starts screaming and swearing in polish had 5 polish friends who were my high school buddies and we used to play a lot of online <unk> on east europe servers where they swear in russian and polish so you pick some shit up so the <unk> keeps screaming and that was the <unk> for the police officer to come around the corner and have a talk with this guy 
 the guy sees the cops and is frozen on the spot 
 i proceed to walk around the corner with my friend and we walk towards the guy until we 're infront of him 
 the police officer ask him what the issue is and why he 's screaming he proceed to tell the officer that someone locked his bike 
 the officer looks at him and smiles then points at me and tells him that 's funny cause this guy just told me his bike got stolen and that this bike looks exactly the same as his 
 the guy got caught when he could n't show the cops any proof that the bike was his 
 the agony in his face was beautiful 
 on the spot i remembered that i had i had some pictures with my bike that i made in the past and that you could also see the exact same <unk> with it in it 
 the cops were convinced now they proceed to get the bolt cutter from their car and cut the lock like it was nothing 
 before i go away i walk up to the car and look at the guy and tell him thanks for the fix bro i do n't have to pay for jack shit anymore 
 the police officers thanked us and to call them if we ever have another crazy adventure like this 
 i say goodbye to my friend and to tell his dad that i will send him a gift 
 as i get back on my bike i proceed to smile like an idiot 
 while singing i fought the law and i won 
 and the people is how my birthday miracle <unk> 
 **edit : ** i think some people are confused or just <unk> about this story 
 let me explain some little things so you might understand the situation better 
 i live in <unk> 
 in <unk> we use a lot more bikes than cars 
 so that means the rate of bike theft is also very high 
 so high even that there is a suprise check on the road just for bikes 
 to see if they 're stolen or that your bike is still functioning fine you actually get a fine for having <unk> lights or if your break does n't work well 
 so that means we also have <unk> laws just for bikes 
 so do understand some things are easier here when it comes to bikes but some things are also harder because of the laws 
 so before anyone starts rambling about this story making no sense try to imagine that you live in a country where the people actually care about bike <unk> did n't do what happened in these stories i was too <unk> at the time to have the balls to do these but my badass sister and my boyfriend did : a couple of years ago i dated an asshole ah who was physically and verbally abusive 
 after making me a shell of myself stealing my debit card putting me in debt and killing my credit he slept with our married coworker and left me to be one of her several fuck buddies 
 a few months after we broke up he came <unk> back to me to be friends ie : using me for rides and money being the idiot i was i let him right back into my life 
 after a month of watching his abusive and controlling behavior my sister had enough 
 one night while he was showing he still could control me '' his exact words made me stay outside my sister 's house in freezing weather to cry to me about his latest failed <unk> 
 she watched my attempts to try to go inside just to get a jacket only to see him <unk> me down to the stairs 
 she grabbed a large beer mug and called together everyone in the house and got them all to piss in it 
 she calmly went outside mug in hand and walked over to us telling me it was a <unk> beer 
 walking right up to ah sitting on the wall she <unk> me to stand next to her which i did the next moment that beer '' was all over him 
 after <unk> in it for a moment the heat and smell being a dead <unk> he realized what was on him 
 he screamed and ran off into the night to this day if my sister sees him she 'll <unk> then ask what <unk> of piss 
 the other story also involves ah but this time my current boyfriend bf is the one <unk> it out 
 bf and i share a love of wrestling so we were planning on joining some friends at a <unk> a few towns over to watch the latest <unk> 
 ah seeing this as an opportunity to get money out of me see <unk> <unk> women and maybe flirt with someone decided to tag along 
 right off the bat he was being a <unk> refusing to chip in for gas he agreed to get a different ride home and pay them making us drive all over creation for him making us wait outside his house for a half hour then punching bf 's window telling us to behave we were discussing the night 's matches while i painted my nails 
 the ride up he mostly behaved aside from a few crude comments but the second we sat down he was <unk> on making us as miserable as possible 
 my friends had 2 tables one had 2 extra seats the other only had one so to me the <unk> arrangement was obvious but not to asshole 
 as bf and i went to sit at the 2 spots asshole began to complain and <unk> until someone gave him a seat closer to us 
 ah began ordering several expensive drinks and <unk> while bf and i <unk> an order of fries and each had a soda relevant i swear 
 while watching the <unk> bf would occasionally hug me or give me a quick <unk> which apparently pissed ah off so he tried to drag me next to him by my <unk> 
 bf was n't having it so he pulled me back to my seat keeping his arm around me 
 ah reacted by storming out of the restaurant 
 catching up to him he threatened to beat my ass '' if i came near him so i went back inside and enjoyed the rest of the <unk> 
 after it ended ah came back insulted his ride home then came up to bf and i telling us we were going to pay his bill over $ 50 
 take him wherever we were planning to go then bring him home for free 
 i get ready to tell him off when bf puts his hand on my shoulder and tells him we 'll take care of everything but he should go use the bathroom because it 'll be a long drive 
 ah agrees and says at least one of us has a brain <unk> away 
 i 'm about to tell bf off when he tosses my coat at me and drags me out to the car 
 5 minutes later my phone starts blowing up but its ignored 
 i later found out ah began begging everyone a free ride home saying i 'd promised him the night was on me nope so he did n't bring his wallet another lie 
 he was forced to pay his bill with tip then pay my friend $ 50 for a ride <unk> is a long story 
 i am leaving out 95 % of the drama <unk> it would take up too much space 
 it 's about my second husband and how i went from <unk> happy to completely <unk> in less than two years and how i paid him back 
 we met at work and i thought we had a fun and friendly work relationship 
 that 's what i thought until the day i gave notice to quit 
 after that he seemed upset and when he called me from work on mothers day i found out why 
 he told me about his 20 year <unk> and hateful marriage 
 and he told me he loved me 
 my first thought was wtf 
 a married guy from work tells me he loves me 
 but after 7 years alone it was nice to know i could still find someone to love me 
 as my last week at work wound down we started to meet for lunch dinner after work hot <unk> sessions in the car 
 i was determined to not have actual sex with him because i had always had a rule against dating married men 
 but the passion was just too hot the <unk> too strong the whispers of love too <unk> to stop at just kissing 
 once the deed was done there was no going back 
 the sex was just too good too <unk> and so so so very <unk> i just could n't wait to have him for my own 
 after a couple of months we moved in together 
 it was like a <unk> 
 i was his <unk> 
 he took such good care of me he <unk> on me he did everything for me 
 we had sex every day two three up to five times a day and i thought i was in <unk> 
 there was drama with his ex but he loved '' me and we could get past it 
 i was in love i was blind to his <unk> but that changed 
 eventually he started to get jealous over any interaction i had with men co-workers clients men i walked past in the grocery store 
 it started to go <unk> wrong 
 we eventually moved into his former <unk> home and it went beyond horrible 
 he started to slap me around the emotional abuse and accusations increased to an every day occurrence 
 i had a feeling he was cheating there were clues but he told me i was crazy and imagining things 
 i <unk> it in my <unk> mind because he loved '' me 
 then i knew he was cheating 
 i went to his <unk> game in <unk> and saw him with her 
 i finally knew i had to leave 
 i left him and did not tell him where 
 i got another job and did not tell him where 
 this was in the days before cell phones so i did n't give him my new phone numbers 
 but we had some friends in common and he begged them to tell me he still '' loved '' me that he was done with her and that he wanted me back 
 i know i was stupid but he loved '' me and i agreed to see him 
 the heat was still there hot as <unk> and i moved back in with him 
 i quit the crappy job i hated and it was going to be fine 
 and it was for the weekend 
 but he told me i had to go he was wrong and he wanted to be with her 
 so i eventually found a new place to live found a new job and i was going to move forward with my life 
 wrong 
 the same <unk> was repeated not once not twice but 5 or 6 times always ending the same way him <unk> me until i went back to him him telling me to leave the last time i went back he asked me to marry him and fool that i was i said yes because he loved '' me 
 it was not a marriage made in <unk> 
 he was still seeing her 
 he was still being emotionally abusive he still slapped me around and accused me of cheating on him because i was 5 minutes late getting home from work and i was chewing <unk> to cover up the smell of cum on my breath '' 
 yes the cheating bastard actually said that even though i had never even thought about cheating on him but i guess that 's what the pot does to convince himself that the <unk> is black 
 the marriage lasted for 7 weeks 
 i left and moved in with family he knew them so he knew where i was 
 this time i was strong 
 he would call and leave messages for me and i would n't call back 
 he wanted to see me but i refused 
 he eventually filed for divorce 
 i did not <unk> it 
 the divorce was scheduled for final <unk> on a monday and he called me on the friday before 
 he started to leave a message that went something like this 
 him : hi baby i guess you know court is scheduled for monday 
 but i really miss you and i still love '' you and maybe we can work things out if you want to give it another try 
 there 's still time to cancel the divorce so if you think we can make it give me a call back ... .. i pick up the phone then but i do n't stop the record function on the answering machine and i get our entire 30 minute phone conversation on tape 
 during this conversation i play along letting him know i still love him too 
 he tells me he is totally done with her that he was only with her because he was so screwed up about us and he did n't want to be alone if he could n't be with me 
 <unk> blah blah blah 
 same old crap he had been feeding me for the last year but the things he was saying about her were things she needed to hear 
 and by this time i was so over the bastard i wanted the divorce to be absolutely and <unk> final 
 so i keep him talking knowing full well that her is going to be arriving home from work soon 
 when he starts trying to end the call i do everything i can to keep him talking asking if her is going to be home soon and he says <unk> her 
 i do n't give a <unk> about her 
 but i got ta go now and i will call you sunday '' 
 click 
 so i take that tape and make 5 copies 
 over the past 9 months i had been doing some detective work 
 using his phone bills i was able to get the addresses of her brother ex-husband and parents 
 i sent copies of the tape to all of them with a note telling them to make sure her <unk> to it 
 i also sent a copy to her at his address 
 i sent them on saturday overnight express but i did not know that the post office delivers overnight packages on sunday 
 so my plan to get the tapes delivered on monday after court failed 
 i also delivered a copy of the tape to his attorney 's office who threatened me for illegally <unk> a phone conversation to which i responded that he had to know it might be recorded because he started to leave a message and i forgot '' to stop the tape 
 that shut the attorney right up 
 so on sunday the day before the divorce was supposed to be final i get the final message 
 he is pissed screaming the <unk> <unk> of females that anyone has ever heard 
 he sounds like he 's <unk> at the mouth he threatens revenge he screams that the divorce will be final and he is done with me 
 he went on for at least 10 minutes and i am sure her was there listening to his final rant against me 
 i wish i could have been there when her listened to the tape and knowing that he might have <unk> the tape i sent to his house is why i sent tapes to her relatives 
 i wanted to make sure she heard what he said about her 
 only she was just as stupid as i was and ended up married to him 
 but it still was n't over 
 he started leaving love '' notes on my car 
 he sent me <unk> on my birthday 
 i sent the notes and <unk> back to her and told her to get her man some professional help <unk> he was just plain crazy 
 so i wished for a man who would love me and have sex as often as i wanted 
 i got a man who '' loved '' me and had sex more often than any woman needed 
 but i should have known that a cheater will always be a cheater 
 and it was my big big bad for breaking my rule about never dating married men 
 never happened again 
 i did hear later that they were still married and that he was still cheating on her 
 better her than me 
 edit for clarity : although he was still legally married they were living apart ex was living with her boyfriend and there were custody and property issues that delayed the final divorce <unk> 
 so even though <unk> were still legally married i was not the cause of the breakup 
 but it is not a wise choice to be with someone until the final papers are <unk> few years ago i was going to a & amp p school for 6 hours a night after working a 10 hour day all week 
 i hated being there along with everyone else that was there 
 we had this huge fucking <unk> named <unk> as a classmate 
 he 'd done time for theft drove a bmw that mom and dad had bought for him disappeared so often that our <unk> made it a weekly assignment for someone to keep <unk> on him and make sure he was n't stealing something or fucking shit up 
 everytime he got in trouble for some stupid shit he did he 'd try to blame the instructors like they had it out for him personally 
 everyone and i mean everyone hated the idiot 
 he made all our lives even more <unk> than it already was 
 on our smoke breaks he 'd smoke half a cigarette knock the cherry off and set it in a little <unk> on a sort of <unk> wall then go back inside 
 he would always come back out at the next break and finish it 
 for 16 months 5 nights a week i would pick up his <unk> cigarette butt stick it in my pants rub the filter on my asshole as if <unk> a pool stick place it back on into the <unk> and then watch him smoke it at the next break 
 it <unk> so much that eventually everyone in my class including the instructor knew i was doing it and no one ever said a fucking word 
 the more detailed backstory is here i tried to get some ideas here <unk> but that sub sucks by the way unlike /r/prorevenge 
 *** in my work we have a few people who are true characters 
 unfortunately one of them is not so fun 
 a co-worker an obese version of <unk> <unk> literally whom we call <unk> <unk> because of his name was n't cleaning the toilet after himself for months 
 i and couple other guys tried to talk to him but nothing worked 
 <unk> his trips to the ditch were making unable to use the toilet for any other men for the next <unk> minutes due to poor <unk> and poisoning <unk> which were just hanging in the air 
 i found somewhere on prorevenge about <unk> 
 i tested it out and decided to use it 
 *** i told all the guys to be careful with the toilet and actually i got the support of my actions since no legal way was possible and talking to <unk> <unk> did n't do a thing 
 first i sprayed the toilet sitting with the <unk> solution 
 did n't to a thing but i did n't think about the paper everyone uses to put on the sitting first 
 my second try required little more research and more time to make it work 
 since i 'm a patient person all the time i was delighted with the thoughts of upcoming prorevenge 
 *** i 'm always on time at work unlike <unk> <unk> which gave me the advantage in form of my research and not being spotted on my plans 
 one day i went to the restroom and marked the toilet paper every 10 <unk> and rolled it back 
 all the guys knew to do n't use the toilet which <unk> <unk> was always using 
 after <unk> <unk> 's finished throwing with mud on the <unk> and a significant amount of time has passed i went to measure how much paper does <unk> <unk> use 
 for the safety reasons i repeated this procedure on another day 
 *** the 3rd step was simple since i had all my data necessary 
 i <unk> the amount of the paper he uses and i sprayed the <unk> solution while i was rolling the toilet paper back letting it to dry a little 
 very important here is the message i left 
 i wrote on a sticky note polite information which i placed little after <unk> <unk> would already wiped his butt with <unk> '' paper so he did n't see the message before he rubbed the <unk> on 
 the message said : <unk> <unk> i ask you to start cleaning after yourself and to not make the toilet to smell like a <unk> 
 this is the last warning 
 the next step will be letting to know all the female employees about the situation which as you know was the secret among males 
 your co-worker '' 
 or something like that 
 i made sure with an american co-worker that there are no grammar mistakes so the note would n't point directly to me since i 'm the only male in the company who 's english is a second language 
 and since <unk> <unk> knew my writing i made sure it 's <unk> 
 to be 100 % sure everything will work like planned i made fresh coffee after the lunch which i knew <unk> <unk> will <unk> to soon after hit the gym '' 
 *** every male employee knew what 's about to happen 
 we all were waiting in <unk> for <unk> <unk> very curious of the outcome hoping to teach <unk> <unk> a lesson which his mom definitely forgot to do 
 he walked our sweating and walking funny and very fast 
 he could n't sit longer than 30 seconds at his desk and suddenly walked out from the office 
 he did n't show up back that day 
 he also did n't call the boss that he 's leaving but we made sure that he wo n't get in trouble covering for him 
 *** the toilet has been <unk> clean from the moment the message was delivered 
 i can also tell <unk> <unk> spends much less time sitting on the toilet 
 we still wait after he 's done just to be safe 
 *** all the guys promised to forget about the revenge and to never talk again about it 
 i 'm sure <unk> <unk> will remember the lesson 
 *** so what really happened with the solution and <unk> <unk> 's ass 
 the solution itself has no color and no <unk> 
 but it burns the hell out of every part of skin you put it on 
 i accidentally touched my face after testing even i washed my hands very carefully with a lot of dish washing soap and it still burned my face 
 i ca n't imagine the agony and the burning <unk> after rubbing it on your <unk> 
 until this day i have no idea what happened to <unk> <unk> after he received the message 
 the next day everything was back to normal besides the toilet has been clean 
 *** tl dr - a co-worker did n't want to start cleaning after himself and one day his ass gets on <unk> i was in the 12th grade i went to a house party with a few of my friends 
 this was back when the hot game console was the <unk> 
 relevant later when we walked in the kid that lived in the house and a couple of his friends were sitting there <unk> this really wasted girl 
 like putting their hands down her pants and <unk> each other 's fingers and shit 
 we broke up the <unk> party and took her home 
 she begged us not to report the incident 
 i 'm not totally sure about her reasons 
 with it being a tiny town and the perpetrator being a football star and the popular guy in school she claimed that there would be some sort of <unk> 
 that sucks but we respected her wishes 
 fast forward to several weeks later to the scene of a huge house party at the same place 
 he had a brand new <unk> and we each took turns slipping into the party when everyone was passing out and we pissed all inside the <unk> <unk> and down into the inside of the console to where you could shake it and would <unk> 
 another friend of mine that had no piss on deck <unk> a giant <unk> into one of his <unk> drawers 
 another one of us went in mr. rapist 's mom and dad 's bedroom lifted up the <unk> stuck his finger down his throat and vomited a <unk> case '' of white <unk> <unk> onto their bed and then neatly made the bed back 
 i 'm sure when they returned from their church convention four days later it smelled pretty nice in that room 
 his <unk> pastor father grounded him for all eternity 
 he was never <unk> for the crime but last i saw him mr. curious hands now in his mid 30 's had six or seven small children and was in line at the local pawn shop trying to pawn a stolen tv for some meth 
 it 's a small midwestern town 
 if you take a shit everyone knows 
 edit : i know this story is real 
 for me to try too hard to convince every <unk> would be <unk> : me 19 f and my sister 23 have never gotten along 
 she has always had it out for me for as long as i can remember ... i have two younger siblings 17 f and 15 m who she <unk> and for the most part gets along with 
 for example she used to yell at me for going in the car with my mom to pick her up from places when she was in middle <unk> school on vacations with my cousins we all slept in the same bed and she would <unk> me to the point of tears and whisper cruel things to me she was around <unk> when i was about 12 she threw <unk> at me for being on the computer and not getting off when she wanted ... .i could go on forever but these are a few of the more minor things she 's done 
 she has no <unk> and cares only about herself and things that will benefit her regardless of who she hurts 
 she is extremely <unk> as well 
 after doing a bit of growing up i thought we were past this and able to tolerate each other but tonight proved otherwise 
 i got a text from my younger sister telling me that my older sister was yelling and screaming that i had taken things from her room while she was away for the <unk> i <unk> home knowing what she is capable of in this type of mood to find her screaming you know what you did <unk> you '' etc ... she couldnt tell me exactly what i took from her but she knew <unk> was missing ... i yelled back a bit and shrugged it off until i walked into my room to find this the clothes are minor but the puppy holds <unk> <unk> of sentimental <unk> picked up one of the legs off of my floor and fell to the floor in <unk> 've had him for 11 years and fallen asleep with him in my arms every night 
 she knew how much this would hurt me 
 in third grade i went to work with my father for the day 
 after work he took me over to his friends restaurant in the <unk> and we hung out there for a bit 
 i remember him giving me a little bit of money and his friends girlfriend now wife took me into the south street <unk> mall where i picked out the <unk> <unk> stuffed animal i could find 
 we went back into the restaurant and started <unk> <unk> we finally decided on <unk> ... a combination of my name her name and the waitresses name who i always thought was the coolest girl from then on <unk> pretty much became my best friend in a way ... he always provided me with <unk> so when i walked in to see her do <unk> over something that she was imagining killed me ... i do n't know what to do with <unk> 'm hurt angry and sad about this whole situation ... any questions comments or suggestions would be greatly <unk> <unk> skirt is by the brand <unk> ... i bought it last year for a great price at <unk> but i ca n't seem to find it online anywhere ... anyone know a place that would have it 
 <unk> so my parents said they had this long talk with her she will replace what she damaged and that i need to let it go ... this type of behavior from her is not uncommon and has been <unk> since i was young 
 i threatened a police report and got yelled at 
 i asked for money to install <unk> on my closet doors and i was told to knock it off 
 i really do n't understand what goes through my parents heads but my sister is not mentally <unk> warned 
 this is a very long story i have <unk> it and left out some details so any <unk> please ask 
 what occurred happened over the course of a year 
 & amp nbsp my mum is a very sweet lady 
 divorced 
 70 years old still works full time 
 <unk> of everybody 
 she still lives in my family home and rents out a room to help with the bills and the company it’s a fairly large house 
 we have had a string of <unk> live in the house over the years but this one was nothing like we ever expected 
 enter james a <unk> <unk> man who worked in executive <unk> 
 <unk> years old <unk> on top a golden handshake and an air of superiority 
 he came telling tales of divorce and looking for somewhere to live that felt like a family home and not a hotel room 
 strange but he sold the story to my <unk> 
 he has id he has business cards backing up his claim of employment 
 he seems like an ideal <unk> 
 & amp nbsp things go normally for half a year 
 he seems like a nice guy 
 he is constantly telling us that he works for a <unk> company and is waiting on delivery of a <unk> company car 
 this was the first red flag 
 he <unk> us with stories of his past and tells my mum he was in the army in his younger years 
 specifically the parachute <unk> 
 after a while he begins to make romantic moves with my mum and spending more and more time together 
 he takes a copy of my <unk> and offers to help me find better employment either at his company or at one of his clients 
 even going so far as to arrange meeting with me to help me with my interview <unk> 
 he pays his rent on time often with a little extra for my mum 
 keeps saying he will be moving back out into his own property soon 
 & amp nbsp this is where things start to fall apart 
 it is now 8 months and the <unk> has never arrived 
 he has an excuse for everything 
 job interviews i am lined up for mysteriously start being cancelled he is now <unk> involved with my mother 
 i get a little suspicious but my <unk> are cooled when i am involved in a 3 way phone conversation with himself and a client as a primary job interview for an incredibly prestigious job which i am afterwards told went very well and i would have a sit down shortly he even starts offering to buy my mother and myself new cars 
 he arrives with <unk> and books test drives for various cars 
 it was fun but it just didn’t sit well with me 
 i should not have done it but i had a quick search of his room and found <unk> with two different names and paperwork in a black back pack that suggested he had been arrested before 
 i immediately tried to explain the situation to my mum who dismissed it without reason rose <unk> glasses and an <unk> argument starts 
 i leave the house covering all my tracks 
 i never found out who the client was on the phone 
 & amp nbsp a week later i get a phone call from a <unk> firm asking me who i am and why i was in their system 
 it turns out that tony was a <unk> who had set-up a side business with an existing <unk> agency to provide high end <unk> 
 the owner / business partner was impressed with his <unk> but so far he had failed to deliver on just about everything and started missing days in the office 
 because of this they had gone through his e-mail and found one from me when i sent him my <unk> 
 at first they suspected me of being a client he was dealing with off the books but it later turned out everything he had promised the company had been a lie 
 he was claiming commission for <unk> staff at companies that either never show up or did n't exist at all 
 a 2 hour phone call with the ceo of this company was enough to prove all my <unk> 
 this guy was either a <unk> liar or a <unk> & amp nbsp it took a very long conversation with my mum followed by an argument and then another conversation to get her to see sense 
 it was only then that she shared more details i had previously not known 
 he had been <unk> about her will more and more and the value of the house 
 promised her holidays that never <unk> and his behaviour was becoming stranger and stranger 
 it was at first a bit embarrassing so many <unk> we had both either not seen or ignored but with the rose <unk> glasses firmly taken off it was all so clear 
 my mum had just returned from having a meal with tony before i had a sit down with her 
 our plan was to search his room find evidence and either go to the police or wait for him to return 
 the first thing i did was try and locate his backpack along with the <unk> but it was gone 
 everything else was still in the room but that bag 
 i had a <unk> feeling that he had already guessed the game was up i was being far too aggressive with my <unk> for information and had some how tipped him off 
 we waited for him to return 
 & amp nbsp he never returned 
 he had realised the game was up 
 i’m not sure how but just like that he was gone 
 my mum was heart broken i was stressed 
 we realised a lot of the things he had promised had been lies 
 it hurt 
 i had taken days off work for job interviews that never <unk> 
 my mum had started to work less and less under promises that she would be financially supported by him 
 i needed my revenge 
 i needed to make him pay for hurting my family hurting me hurting my mum 
 we can only <unk> what his end plan was 
 we suspect he was after the house but she’s incredibly healthy by normal standards let alone a 70 year old woman 
 god knows what he had planned to do 
 & amp nbsp i did n't sleep that night 
 the first thing i did was change the locks and get a close friend to watch the house 
 i then told the people next door what had happened and asked them to keep an eye out 
 i then logged a complaint with the police via a friend in the force and set to work 
 & amp nbsp the first piece of revenge take every possession he had and donate it to the local homeless shelter 
 the sharp suits shoes <unk> and still in boxes his tie collection 
 class rings <unk> 
 all given to the homeless 
 it took 2 trips in my truck to move them but we did it 
 i hope we had some very well dressed homeless people that year 
 i hope the suits helped them with job interviews 
 i then called his now ex business partner / boss and confirmed what had happened 
 the two of us set to work contacting every <unk> company in the area with a copy of his photo name s and a brief explanation that he was not to be trusted 
 we also went through a list of his previous employers / customers 
 many of them confirmed similar strange <unk> on and agreed to spread the word 
 i then contacted a friend who actually was in the parachute <unk> 
 they can find no record of his existence he claimed he saw combat in one particular war which would have made him eligible for a certain <unk> or <unk> 
 no record is found of this 
 the army take a <unk> view of people falsifying service 
 & amp nbsp so we had taken his job and all the possessions he had except the clothes on his back and his car 
 god i wanted that car 
 i wanted to crush it 
 next was to remove his support network 
 we tried to trace his family eventually finding the name and number of his ex-wife 
 we called her she was a lovely woman who confirmed what we thought 
 it was not the first time suspicious <unk> on had happened but it was certainly the worst it had been 
 she had left him over his escalating behaviour 
 she suspects the behaviour to be from a break down of some kind 
 tells us he used to be very successful but lost his job and it set him on a <unk> <unk> 
 she talks to their 3 children who immediately wash their hands of him 
 she confirms his lack of military service and <unk> in a lot of <unk> for us 
 i had taken from him his home his job his carrier his clothes and now his family 
 the police now had a report and where looking for him too and my friend in the parachute <unk> told me not to worry about whatever they were doing about it just to know they knew about it 
 & amp nbsp i spent a week touring the homeless <unk> hospitals and hotels looking for him 
 i drove over 800 miles at night looking for his car 
 we will never know where he went but i never found him or his car 
 his family have since had contact and his youngest son knows where he is 
 they assure me he checked into a <unk> and is receiving help 
 i’m not convinced but i’m not going to shake a teenage boy down for the location of him 
 his name and face is <unk> into my mind and i want nothing more than to take from him his <unk> but even i have a limit 
 but one day i will come across him again 
 i don’t know what i will do then 
 & amp nbsp post script : this occurred over the course of a year 
 there are a lot of details i had to miss out to keep this short enough to post 
 on the face of it all involved look very naive for falling for it but that is how <unk> perform their art 
 they become part of your life work your way in 
 there is a supporting cast behind this that helped me with my revenge and i will never forget their help 
 i wish i could finish the story with an epic final show down a beating and a trip to the hospital / jail but sadly real life does n't always go that way 
 i took as much as i could from him and i hope i stopped him doing it again i believe he may well have done something to my mum once he got into the will 
 thank you for reading my story 
 & amp nbsp edit - someone pointed out i called him james and then tony 
 james was the name he gave us 
 his real name turned out to be tony 
 we called him james for entire time we knew him 
 since then i have got into the habit of referring to him as tony 
 <unk> returns dog poop left behind by <unk> dog owners 
 go to : when i was growing up my big brother was always a pain in the ass to me 
 he had some anger issues and whatnot and since he was 9 years older than me he thought he was allowed to run the show 
 he would lock me out of the house when he was supposed to be babysitting me he would do fun '' things like <unk> me down and <unk> me in one spot on the head which he called chinese water <unk> '' he told me i was 1/2 <unk> when i was 5 because we 're only 1/2 siblings and i could n't figure out what the other half was and he was just a shitty person all around 
 bonus revenge : one time when he was playing the <unk> game i <unk> the phone and called 911 cried into the receiver and hung up 
 then i put the phone down and ran like hell 
 turns out they called back and my brother could n't answer because the phone was locked outside with me so they sent police cars out 
 my brother had fun explaining that one to my parents 
 well one day i had enough 
 he had all these gaming <unk> and stuff that were considered hot shit at the time <unk> 
 he never let me play with them and i thought that was rude so i planned my revenge 
 one summer he went away *all* summer long and left his car in our barn 
 he also left all his little plastic game save things i do n't know what they 're called 
 they 're little cards that you would save your game to and each card was a different game 
 in his room 
 well i went into his room and took all the cards i could see and buried them around the property 
 but did i stop there 
 <unk> 
 he had a glorious car in the garage that was just <unk> to be messed with 
 so what did i do 
 i took a jar of <unk> and i dumped the whole thing in the back of his car 
 now keep in mind that it gets <unk> than a <unk> goat 's ass in a pepper patch during the summer 
 by the time he got back his car smelled <unk> ** but that 's not even the best part 
 he was moving across country after that summer to go live in arizona and he had no choice but to take the car that smelled like death and sweet sweet revenge 
 **tl dr** be nice to your little siblings 
 edit : a lot of you are getting <unk> over this 
 i told him about it a few years ago and he punched me on the arm and laughed 
 he said the car smelled horrible and he hated that trip and he never even knew the memory cards thanks <unk> were missing 
 <unk> <unk> 
 hello reddit 
 i have been reading through quite a few of these <unk> stories today and i must say i am inspired to share 
 i am going to flip a few names for <unk> and to avoid further humiliation of my former roommate 
 a few years back shortly after high school i acquired my first apartment living with two room mates 
 both of them i had considered close enough friends to occupy a space with 
 little did i know that living with people is incredibly complex due to the absolute lack of fucks given during your early 20 's 
 shortly i will get to one of the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> into eviction 
 room mate <unk> had some sort of sick <unk> with eating all of my food 
 did n't matter what it was or who it belonged to ... he would <unk> it 
 <unk> ... my <unk> 's <unk> 
 i had tried multiple <unk> of <unk> with him 
 <unk> my name on the items hiding them even heated confrontation 
 he persisted and it was time to extract vengeance 
 a little background on my situation in order to provide clarity to the story 
 i had been convicted of a crime and ended up having to <unk> a shit load of community service hours working on an animal ranch owned by a non profit organization that <unk> abandoned animals 
 there was a <unk> of random ass animals <unk> from <unk> to <unk> pigs that took residence within this <unk> 
 all of them less than <unk> to work with and clean up after 
 but none of them could <unk> the absolute nightmare cleverly <unk> as a pack of <unk> 's 
 these were mean little bastards who would find any way to torment you 
 be it <unk> shitting chasing staring or shouting 
 they had it out for me from the get go 
 fun fact that most would not know is that <unk> like to all <unk> and shit in one giant pile ... this is like some form of <unk> place for them and they do not like it being <unk> 
 none the less i was responsible for <unk> shovel after shovel of the precious little <unk> into large containers and <unk> them off the property 
 here is where it gets interesting ... i had this sort of <unk> as i dug the shovel into the <unk> giant pile of <unk> love 
 it had an interesting <unk> shape and was relatively light and <unk> 
 it also had different shades of <unk> <unk> from a <unk> peanut butter color to an <unk> dark chocolate tone 
 it looked ... .a lot like <unk> 's <unk> 
 there was no time to waste and no <unk> 
 the son of a bitch had just <unk> the rest of my cereal and it was time to give him a lesson in apartment living 
 i bought a brand new box on the way home and replaced the contents of the bag with <unk> shit that i had collected earlier that day in a <unk> freezer bag 
 even thought i would purchase a chip <unk> and neatly roll it closed as if i had already enjoyed my morning bowl before <unk> it back on the top of the fridge 
 the trap was set ... he rolled out of bed at the usual time around 10pm and enjoyed a quick wake and <unk> before he <unk> himself on whatever delicious treats he could get his hands on 
 the sound of his <unk> on the kitchen floor 
 i <unk> <unk> in my bedroom awaiting the sound of the plastic cereal bag <unk> 
 he was going for it 
 i heard the fridge open for some milk and the drawer open for a spoon 
 i heard him step over to the couch and sit down ... complete silence before the <unk> crunch crunch of victory echoed through the apartment 
 and then ... he turned the tv on 
 and there was another crunch crunch ... then <unk> ... wtf 
 how can you not realize you are eating <unk> shit 
 i told him on the <unk> day of our eviction ... .. tldr : <unk> my shithead roommate into eating <unk> shit 
 in the span of 2-3 months in 2003 i got put into a few situations where i had to get physical with people 
 since that little window of time i haven’t really been in any similar situations 
 here is one of them 
 i read the rules and i 'm not 100 % sure if i should have posted this here or <unk> or some place else 
 if so please redirect me 
 i was at a bar with 2 of my friends called bar in city 
 the bar is closed now so i assume it’s not a big deal that i reference it it was big ass beer night $ 2 for 22 <unk> bottles 
 pretty sweet deal right 
 as you can imagine people get pretty wasted these nights 
 unlike my usual drunken nights i’m not in too bad a shape when we leave the bar at closing time 
 the bar is in a strip mall and the parking lot is located directly across from the entrance to the bar 
 yes this isn’t the <unk> place but was a lot of fun as usual when we leave there is a bunch of people <unk> around typically trying to salvage one last chance of hooking up 
 i get to the parking lot about <unk> from the entrance and see 2 guys <unk> around another guy against a car 
 i assume it’s their buddy and they are just <unk> around wrestling 
 then i notice they are reaching into his pockets and i hear one of them say something along the lines of <unk> his <unk> this kid they have <unk> against the car is completely out of it 
 he is barely able to stand up on his own let alone <unk> off two thugs 
 these kids were pure trash 
 scrawny <unk> up <unk> head punks 
 granted none of those <unk> mean you are trash but i wanted to give a brief description of these guys 
 both of them are probably between <unk> maybe <unk> lbs each 
 at this point i decide i can’t let this go on and decide to intervene 
 i walk over the two guys with my hands held out basically the way you would have them as if you were giving a speech 
 there was no sign of aggression out of me as i was just going to tell them that needed to stop what they were doing 
 once i’m in front of them they back away from the guy and turn my way 
 i’ve got one to my left and one to my right but both in front of me 
 before i could get a word out the guy on the right punches me above my right eye 
 it didn’t hurt but it really woke me up and got my adrenaline <unk> 
 i’m not a small guy 
 i’m <unk> and at this time around <unk> lbs 
 i work out so i’m in pretty decent shape 
 when this happens i’m still not in a <unk> position had it hurt maybe i would have been but i begin to say <unk> 
 well now you fucked <unk> i get out <unk> 
 now you <unk> and the guy on the left punches me in the head right above my left eye 
 now standing there both stunned looks on their faces 
 guess they couldn’t figure out why neither of their hits <unk> me 
 after a 2-3 second pause between the three of us staring at each other the guy to my left who just hit me turns and runs 
 i give a quick glance to the guy to my right and then <unk> it after the guy who took off 
 i’m pretty fast but i’ve got flip <unk> on 
 i’m tearing ass down this strip mall after him and my flip <unk> <unk> off 
 i keep <unk> him 
 he runs towards this guy walking with his girlfriend 
 this is where i get a little confused maybe the guy had seen everything that had just gone down but the guy running from me gets within inches of the guy and his girlfriend and the guy <unk> the thug kid in his face 
 so he runs full force into this guys fist 
 his head and spine fling back 
 it doesn’t knock him down and he turns around the corner to disappear into the night 
 i gave up 
 i wasn’t ever going to catch him 
 i turn around assuming the other guy would be gone too 
 to my surprise my other buddy is <unk> swinging a <unk> metal bat at this guy 
 once i get back to where they are my buddy has stopped swinging the bat and the police have arrived 
 my friend <unk> the bat and is able to put it back into his car prior to the police seeing it 
 everyone is explaining what happened and pointing out the other thug kid as the <unk> of everything that has gone down 
 well he gets arrested and put into the back of the police car 
 i walk by stop next to the police car really big smirk on my face and it makes him go wild 
 calling me a bitch saying he’s going to kill me blah blah blah 
 i give him a <unk> and say <unk> cool <unk> as i turn around towards the crowd i have about 5-6 of this guy’s friends coming up and shaking my hand 
 thanking me for what i’ve done while i’m thinking <unk> the fuck were you guys 
 ” the police ask if i can come to the station and make a statement i say <unk> yeah bullshit 
 my two buddies and i get in our car and head home 
 i hope the thug kid gets what he deserves but i’m not going to a police station at 3 in the morning after a night of drinking 
 **tl/dr do n't be a piece of shit to people 
 **this is a long one 
 i 'll make a line below to let you know when the revenge starts the rest is just back story and <unk> 
 i worked as a contractor under a security company for this one business 
 i was underneath my supervisor super '' from here on out 
 i was young when i first started working there 
 it was my first time actually working in a corporate environment for any real length of time 
 i had no idea how the politics worked the <unk> order and how much like highschool it reminded me 
 super had trained '' me for that site 
 i had really just worked with the company to find out what roles needed to be filled and done by security and i wrote the book for <unk> for that site 
 i had trained every guard that came through that site 
 super got the credit of course 
 super also made mistakes and did n't care about the job 
 since i do n't want to be here all day i 'll just list if 
 if you 'd like an explanation just ask down below 
 screwing up mail and blaming it on me sleeping on the job and blaming the missed work on <unk> '' me telling the employees of my mistakes and personal life taking the credit of any work that i did that he could not hearing '' an exchange between an employee and myself which would have saved me from a write up this one was the last straw by the way since it was so clearly bs 
 and frankly a ton of other mean <unk> and controlling things in and out of work that he said was part of the job '' which included driving around employees and himself before and after work 
 without <unk> gas or time 
 thing was my complaints went no where since the client was best friends with super and one of the requirements for our company having the gig was keeping super on 
 so it was either suck up or leave 
 well i needed the job and the other guards needed a <unk> between them and super 
 related to revenge : i had sold him a broken car he knew it was broken for some small sum of money 
 he had to scrap it i used that money for this next part 
 <unk> see super had a problem 
 he was <unk> 
 worse than that he did n't seem to think it was that big of a deal 
 checked his level maybe once a week 
 using the money from the car purchase i did the only thing that came to mind 
 something my father once told me : when someone makes to mad kill them with kindness '' 
 so that 's what i did 
 using that money i had bought so much candy and <unk> just for him 
 cookies <unk> <unk> <unk> soda <unk> pieces fun size king size <unk> bags german chocolate 
 everything 
 i 'd give him as much candy as he would take 
 and he 'd take a lot 
 see he does n't buy candy or <unk> things normally 
 but if put on a plate he 'd eat it just the same 
 i knew this would take a long time but i had the time and patience to spare 
 i could wait 
 it took 2 years before the medical problems started happening 
 he started going to the doctor more often 
 would never say what was happening though 
 he would start to deny my sweet poison until he saw me enjoying myself 
 then he could n't resist 
 perhaps he was a stress <unk> who knows 
 i had eventually moved to a different position <unk> related but i still kept in touch with security there 
 as well as leave my rather large collection of candy for <unk> <unk> 
 turns out he had to quit working security 
 turns out he had 40 % functionality left of his <unk> 
 last i heard he was having extreme <unk> in his feet as well 
 extreme 
 perhaps but perhaps he should n't have stuffed his face and taken his disease a bit more serious 
 the rest of the security team was happy to not have super around they were now free to do their jobs 
 that is until the next super <unk> came around 
 which is another prorevenge tale in and of itself 
 if people want i can tell that one as well 
 part 2 my mom was the second oldest growing up and had 3 brothers 
 her parents always thought of her as the good kid but only because she was n't as wild as her brothers especially the younger ones and was <unk> about it 
 the following story is one of her favorites and is honestly more brutal than any experience i ever had growing up 
 the youngest of my mom 's brothers was j and he was a real terror when he was a kid 
 one day at the house when they were both very young my mom notices j <unk> a pencil 
 normally that would n't be too big of a deal but he kept going and going on the crank one of those old <unk> manual <unk> all the while giving her an evil smile 
 my mom realized what 's coming so she took off running and j started chasing her around the house making <unk> motions with the pencil like an idiot 
 this went on for a little while before my mom suddenly thought about it and <unk> why she was running 
 after all he may have had a sharp pencil but she was older and she should be able to use her <unk> to put j to back in his place instead of running away like he wanted 
 she stopped turned around with her hand held straight out and shouted at j to stop 
 this probably would have worked except j was too close to stop and he ended up <unk> the pencil through my mom 's hand when he ran into her 
 i do n't know where the adults were before all this but they showed up and took my mom to the hospital 
 everything was sorted out with no lasting damage 
 i 'm sure j was punished for what he did in some way but my mom can carry a grudge and she was not satisfied yet 
 my mom got better and soon after she was able to get her revenge 
 j and my mom were playing a game of <unk> ball outside and j just so happened to have a bottle of coke that he was drinking from 
 this is back in the days when coke was only sold in those tall glass bottles 
 at some point during the game it was my mom 's turn to serve the ball when j picked up his bottle to take a drink 
 she saw her chance and took it without thinking 
 she served the ball and watched as it <unk> around the pole and directly into the back of the bottle j was drinking from 
 my mom was able to play it off as an accident at the time and j had to get new teeth put in but once again there was n't any long term damage 
 tldr : my uncle <unk> stabbed my mom in the hand with a pencil so she used a <unk> ball to knock out his top 2 front <unk> love riding bicycles 
 i 'm good at it and i 'm safe 
 in this story i was riding on a busy but necessary street at night 
 helmet <unk> and flashing lights were in use 
 a bunch of bros in a big suv came up close beside me and started <unk> towards and away from me while yelling and taunting - trying to crash me into parked cars 
 i ignored them as best i could and they gave up soon but as they pulled away i <unk> a great <unk> of spit towards their vehicle 
 i was hoping to hit the windshield but to my happy surprise it entered the passenger window and i heard an angry <unk> of surprise 
 i like to imagine that it hit that fucker square in the face 
 tl dr : suv <unk> tried to run me off the road i spit in one of their faces from <unk> i have this cousin who can definitely be an ass 
 first of all he thinks he is a hot shot 
 he works at apple but is one of those home <unk> 
 truth is he probably only makes about $ <unk> per hour 
 i personally make about $ <unk> a year 
 regardless of the <unk> he tries to make it sound like he is better than me 
 for example he tells my friends that i 'm not very bright 
 not going to go through the reasons but i am definitely brighter 
 he also brags that once he gets married or moves in with his girlfriend he will be making ton of money and get a better house than me 
 there are other examples but you can take the hint 
 this guy is an ass 
 now his girlfriend is the exact opposite 
 she is completely cool and she is finishing school for a pharmacist 
 he treats her like shit 
 rarely pays for dates does n't open the car door for her etc 
 he really does n't know how to treat a woman 
 you may be wondering why she puts up with this crap 
 the truth is she has a low self <unk> of herself 
 no idea why cause she has it all 
 i 'm not a person who usually <unk> any kind of revenge as i figure a person will get what eventually is coming to them 
 but once i got some breaking info i decided to use it to my advantage 
 when the ashley madison <unk> happened i did a search to see who is on the list 
 searched a lot and got nothing 
 but all of a sudden i got my cousins email to come up 
 at first i was thinking why would he be on this 
 i was thinking it was some kind of weird curiosity 
 i then downloaded the database on one of my vm 
 sure enough i did a <unk> and <unk> for the addresses and his popped up 
 he made credit card transactions that totaled about $ 850 
 they took place when his girlfriend was away at college 
 now i know this guy cheated on her 
 this was enough for me 
 clearly he was using her as a sugar <unk> 
 i was thinking just approach her and give her the papers 
 but she might just <unk> it since she thinks i made this up to <unk> him 
 plus i did n't 
 want to be known for breaking up the relationship 
 so i sent an anonymous big envelope with her school info as the return address 
 that way she would more than likely open it 
 i gave her all the info to prove he was cheating on her with married women 
 well it took a couple of weeks but she finally broke up with him 
 i found out she spoke to my brother in laws wife as they are close 
 she helped <unk> the deal 
 both my brother in law and wife did n't think my cousin was right for his girlfriend 
 and they wanted them to break up 
 but there is more to the story 
 it was a big deal he lost his meal ticket to <unk> 
 but something else came out of this 
 so apparently he was going to the genius bar where he used to work and was stealing tons of small stuff 
 like <unk> cables power <unk> cases and etc 
 his ex knew it 
 but again with the low self <unk> she never said anything 
 well she turned him in to the local apple store and apple eventually fired him <unk> investigating 
 this caused a <unk> of events 
 he lost his truck and now stuck living with his mom 
 he 's 25 years old and still stuck with mommy 
 needless to say his bragging is much less tldr : arrogant cousin pisses me off 
 find he cheats on his girlfriend through <unk> madison told his girlfriend lost his girlfriend and his <unk> was a few years ago when i was in final year of highschool 
 i found out one of the students in the year below thought he was smart by hacking '' all the girls emails by setting up email forwarding when they left their computers alone 
 he had been listening in on gossip '' that was being shared around that he had no business of looking at 
 so the next time in web dev class i set up a quick script that would spam his email address with 100 's of messages 
 as it turns out since it was running over the local network i was sending email faster then it could be processed by his inbox and it ended up at <unk> % <unk> he could n't move email to trash because he was over <unk> the system could n't <unk> 
 he goes to the it office to get his email account looked at and the school it guy could n't even fix it he had to issue him a new login when asked why his email was full of messages from an unknown source he could n't answer so i suspect that the it guy figured he had <unk> his own account 
 first one this story is n't as extreme as the last story at least as far as the revenge goes 
 however <unk> deserved worse 
 as i said before i had moved to another job after security 
 this job was in that building 
 <unk> had told new boss boss from here on out not to hire me 
 that i was lazy rude distracted ect 
 however boss had known me for years at this point and known this was not true 
 i made sure boss did not regret hiring me and took any assignment or overtime he needed covered 
 all jobs were done when they needed to be done 
 i was the go to guy in my new job 
 <unk> had gotten sick and left his position 
 instead of promoting anyone they had hired <unk> into the position 
 literally everyone else in the building knew how to do <unk> job better than he did 
 come to find out <unk> is really just <unk> <unk> : likes to take <unk> pass the blame ect 
 <unk> 
 only <unk> had an additional hobby 
 he like to <unk> sexually harass the female guards 
 multiple to my knowledge at least 3 by as many guards complaints were filed with both the company and the <unk> company 's hr 
 every one of those guards were transferred to another site 
 at this point the guards that i 've trained and worked with still see me as part of the team i was the lead after all 
 but there was nothing i could have done i was no longer working with them 
 only thing i could do was to let them know to warn the female guards ahead of time and to keep an eye out 
 some time after all this i broke a rule 
 my mistake i admit that 
 i wont get into it because it 's far too long for my patience to type out 
 what is relevant are the below details 
 * i broke rule * <unk> was sleeping during this time * <unk> did n't like that i broke rule and made a big deal out of it * i made it a bigger deal 
 since <unk> assured destruction was an acceptable outcome in my book 
 turns out it reached the c-level 
 also turns out the c-level cared more about the details of the people responsible for <unk> the building than me breaking that rule 
 i got called into a phone meeting where <unk> boss my boss and <unk> were on the other end 
 i was told to drop it by them 
 my boss knew i was telling the truth but did n't want to lose me respect him for looking out 
 but this is when <unk> made it my business 
 he called me a liar that everything i dug up all the evidence all the <unk> reports 
 were all lies 
 everyone in that room knew the truth but he called me a liar 
 i 'm a dick yea 
 but i 'm not a liar by any stretch and that set me off 
 see everyone knew me from my days as security and i knew everyone 
 from c-level and down to the janitor 
 i had asked a c that i was friendly with what the deal was 
 he said there was n't enough evidence 
 after showing him what i collected he says this never made it up to him 
 i was confused and did some digging 
 turns out that my boss was a little too <unk> of <unk> 's boss 
 <unk> 's boss liked to keep things to himself because if <unk> looked bad his boss would look bad 
 the c-level guy said not to worry he 'd take care of it 
 a week later <unk> was out the door 
 my evidence plus some i did n't collect helped put him there 
 also the security company was told that if they did n't take proper action against <unk> then there would n't be a contact for them anymore 
 they ended up losing the contract anyways because they never let the company know about the harassment issues and that could <unk> the employees 
 currently the super for security is a guy i personally trained and trust 
 overall a really good guy if a bit strict but that 's ok. things are better for my old team and things are better for me since then 
 i 'm not a good story <unk> so if some things dont makes sense please let me know 
 edit : let lose the typos of <unk> own story of revenge : after a mutual friend '' of a number of my friends ended up knowingly and with <unk> screwed a couple of us out of 1000 $ each we decided it was time <unk> a pay back campaign 
 not sure if it is still an option but remember how the little magazine <unk> <unk> that always fell out used to say bill me later '' next to the credit card info 
 well we spread out a individually <unk> and filled out a pile of the <unk> <unk> we could find then moved onto all the kid mags we could find then on and on till we had a massive pile that he would have to slowly deal with for years to come 
 not satisfied yet we moved onto to browsing the internet for as many sign ups as we could find starting with a <unk> <unk> list na aa and various <unk> failure support groups <unk> to fight club and so on ... the list goes on and on ... all calling his phone to remind him of the next meeting 
 finally feeling tired of all the paper work '' revenge we satisfied our need for some physical revenge by using a super glue <unk> and some <unk> to effectively <unk> every truck and door lock we could get to from the outside of his house 
 story here : copied for easy reading : & gt did n't walk in but found out she was sleeping with a vp of our company and had planned a trip to napa <unk> over our anniversary under the <unk> of a business trip 
 & gt went to hr and <unk> was promptly fired since she was under him <unk> <unk> and kicked her out of the house 
 this is a story about my ex wife <unk> 
 i thought she was the love of my life 
 we met while i was in grad school while she was working as an intern at the library i <unk> we clicked immediately and the rest was history 
 within 2 years we were married and living happily ever after 
 i worked hard to get where i am at the firm i work at 
 this included sometimes 60 hour work weeks but most of the time i was only working between <unk> hours depending on the project <unk> weekends off 
 she meanwhile just worked as <unk> 's and never finished school up 
 we were members at a <unk> club and she would <unk> spend time there more and more even though she just used it for the <unk> part and never really worked out 
 soon it was getting ridiculous she was also more and more <unk> about her phone 
 so one night we were drunk and she passed out 
 then her phone buzzed and an unknown number popped up asking if i was gon na be at work the next day 
 she was smart and never had any messages saved over 2 days from him but the texts were <unk> 
 i forwarded them to me and kept the information 
 the marriage was done right then and there and to think we were gon na try for kids 
 i immediately <unk> us from the club which pissed her off and caused a huge fight but i said we have to save up for the baby and a new house '' she reluctantly agreed 
 she never did have the best <unk> so this was bad for her 
 i then set up cameras in the house for future use of course in court 
 i just needed time to collect my thoughts and my evidence and plot 
 i went on business trips '' and recorded her fucking the guy in our bed 
 that was it for me i hated her 
 i spent the next <unk> months buying greasy <unk> more and more beer and loading our <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 each morning i would wake up early and get us <unk> every morning for that time 
 she easily gained 25 lbs over that <unk> gained like 10 <unk> worth it 
 i also did what i could to be the best husband ever over that time 
 i called her all sorts of things and treated her like a <unk> so she wouldnt suspect a thing 
 i made the most romantic <unk> and made our 4 year anniversary a dream <unk> of hers 
 i did everything she wanted in bed and <unk> in her <unk> <unk> 
 i brought her shopping almost <unk> and took her to the best restaurants 
 i wanted her to know how much i loved her and would say things like i would never hurt you i would always love you <unk> mine forever were a team etc and you feel the same way right '' 
 i dont know if it was the extra weight or the romantic <unk> but she seemed to stop going to him and was spending more and more time with me and <unk> in love i suppose '' now was the time to strike 
 after saving up quite a bit we had a serious talk about starting the process of having a kid it sucked <unk> this could have been one of the best conversations of my life but instead it became the <unk> point of my revenge 
 we would do this thing where we would send eachother a text about what we were thinking even if we were face to face it <unk> in all that time in the library together and was reserved for romantic <unk> <unk> or sexual texts 
 long story short this kind of communication was very intimate and special to us 
 so right when we started to talk i said <unk> take your phone out '' she knew what this meant and was grinning ear to ear she probably thought i was gon na say something cute ... instead i sent her a video 
 the look on her face was priceless 
 she couldnt speak she couldnt move she was <unk> 
 she began <unk> in tears and said she stopped seeing him 2 months ago and that it only happened a handful of times 
 and that i worked too much and she was lonely and she was sorry and that he meant nothing and that we could move past it and have kids 
 she was a wreck 
 i told her she shattered my heart and that i could never forgive her and that she was everything to me 
 she was ecstatic 
 begging me to stay saying she would do anything 
 i simply said no and that i already had a lawyer and that she could damn well bet that <unk> <unk> was gon na bite her harder than a bull <unk> 
 in the divorce i let her keep her car that i bought and all her assets we had a split bank account since it was easier 
 i gave her the last 5 months on our lease and that was it 
 she got even bigger and looks like shit now 
 she tries to contact me all the time but i just never respond best part she can see that its read '' 
 i really dont have feelings for her at all she was in retrospect so selfish and only looked after herself and others if they suited her needs 
 her parents were class acts and were so sorry to hear what she did to me i doubt they even talk to her my ex <unk> loved me 
 shes alone as far as i can tell and struggling tbh i pity her and feel bad because she used to be beautiful 
 currently im not looking to date i 'm 26 and in the best shape of my life making great money 
 i post all my fun times and frequently with with beautiful girls from <unk> or <unk> or whatever im up to that given weekend 
 my new single life is actually amazing and ive found a new part of me that would have been lost with her 
 i shattered her soul body mind and heart by giving her everything and taking it away at the perfect time 
 nothing too elaborate but enough to <unk> lasting damage 
 the revenge doesnt feel that good now since i barely think of her but its nice <unk> and then to see my greatest enemy be <unk> to a spec 
 i had an extremely annoying client who either never wanted to pay me for my services computer repair or would be so <unk> about everything that it was never worth my time to do anything for him 
 he ran a radio station over the internet that supposedly had several thousand <unk> and mainly played old r & amp b except on sundays which played <unk> 
 he brought the computer that did the <unk> in one day and wanted me to fix it 
 he would constantly get it <unk> with viruses and has absolutely no sense whatsoever in using a computer but he insisted 
 he left it overnight the problem was resolved within just a few minutes 
 i hit him with a $ 50 bill on it because i hate him which he immediately balked at 
 ok i thought 
 let 's do this then 
 i loaded up his software and broadcast this all night long 
 he was there waiting for me the next morning when i opened up paid left and i have n't heard from him <unk> than a few years ago i used to work at a college that was quite frankly a <unk> 
 nonetheless i worked there helping students 
 i <unk> myself as a bit of a programmer then and worked a deal with one of the students to <unk> his family 's website 
 <unk> photos <unk> <unk> and design third party tools and services that were free so that they could have the functionality they wanted for free without a major spot of programming on a server that would n't let them have those services anyway think super basic web hosting 
 the works 
 i did it for a <unk> rate cutting my own throat that is and after looking at the code i told him look i know you guys did this in front page originally 
 after i 'm done with the things you want you wo n't be able to update it with front page again because you 'll break it '' 
 i told him this three or four times 
 he <unk> it each time and i set to work 
 back at this time front page could n't handle complex code or <unk> because anything more complicated than a table was trouble 
 if you tried to change it with front page it might look right on the screen but it would n't work in the browser so there was no way to know until you saved over the original whether you broke it or not 
 each phase of the work <unk> a great response 
 i would do a block of work and upload it to the server and he 'd pay me 
 he went in there once to make a small change and totally <unk> the site 
 you used front page did n't you '' 
 yup 
 i 'll fix it but it 's going to cost you more because i told you not to do that and that starts going into support and maintenance which you do n't want 
 you just want code design and that 's it '' 
 he agreed <unk> up the money $ 50 <unk> and then i went about working on the rest of the site 
 once i finished however he <unk> the two final payments about $ 300 and changed the password to the site so that i could n't upload the final block of work and could n't take down anything else i had already uploaded 
 basically he wanted it something like 90 % of the way there and that was good enough for him and it did n't seem to matter much that he was basically stealing 
 i actually had halfway expected this because he was arrogant and abusive to people most of the time but you can only eat so much <unk> before it started to turn your stomach and i was tired of not eating 
 i counted myself just fine with this for the most part 
 i mean i had already made a couple hundred off him and his family and it was more than i would have made if i had n't done it 
 he did n't know everything on the site yet and had n't used every part of it 
 he basically went to the links i sent him agreed to the work and i moved on to the next part 
 cue the third party services my ace in the hole 
 see since he could n't actually change the site anymore without front page totally <unk> it up and breaking the whole thing and i had never given him the passwords to the third party services that literally covered his site i went in and changed the third party content so that it displayed what a thief he was 
 i considered it fair play and even up 
 he never noticed 
 i swear months went buy and he never 
 even 
 noticed 
 eh no big deal 
 at some point his family would notice and then he 'd either have to explain to them <unk> there were notices like that all over the place or have to explain to them how he stiffed me 
 i considered it done and over with 
 and on that it was 
 i just resolved to never deal with him again unless i had to for work 
 turns out that i did indeed have to but not for a while 
 in fact his <unk> towards other people disappeared completely for a while and i began to wonder if he 'd just turned over a new <unk> because you know people can do that 
 i did n't feel one bit sorry for what i 'd done <unk> for <unk> 
 but i was n't angry at him any more 
 the school year progressed and i began to feel a little sorry for him because he was starting to have all kinds of problems including with life in general 
 we ended up chatting once in a while again and he let me know that he was about to get a <unk> <unk> of old computers that were being retired from the college and wanted to know if i 'd build some out of the working spare parts and any other working spare parts left over would be mine 
 i figured hell no way he can screw me on that one so i said sure after <unk> with the college that it was good and legit 
 so i picked up 16 computers that were old and failing built about 5 working <unk> out of it delivered them back to him for him to sell 
 i got a whole <unk> 's worth of spare parts not including cases or power supplies 
 a few weeks later he and i had been talking 
 he had a disability it was n't hidden and there was a piece of software that he 'd come into one of the labs to use i worked multiple departments that allowed him to finish most of his assignments and was targeted at people with his specific disability 
 it was something like $ 5000 at the time and the department head in charge at the time thought it was just fine to leave the install <unk> on the desks in the computer lab in case the cds were needed for anything 
 i told him look i know you need this software and i know how much of a royal pain it is for you to bring yourself all the way across campus when you can put that on your laptop and use it in your dorm room 
 i 'm not always there but the cds are on the desk 
 the lab staff know you and would think nothing of it if you were to bring in your laptop and play with the cd and whatnot '' 
 he got what i was trying to say he said as much 
 i felt bad for the guy you know 
 it did n't require <unk> had no product key etc 
 i made it clear that he should *not* do this while i was there because while i had no problem pretending that i did n't know he wanted it and would plan to copy it but that i also could n't and would n't turn a blind eye if i caught him 
 i made that <unk> clear 
 he <unk> and was still pretty grateful that i let him know all the same 
 about a month passed and he started becoming extremely abusive to everyone again but much worse this time 
 one particular day i had had enough when i walked into the room and he started off with okay dumbass ... <unk> '' 
 my eye actually <unk> a few times ... i did n't trust him anymore and walked up to the lady in charge of the security of that special software ... look i know that cost about $ 5000 per <unk> and you 've got them laying out there for any student to just walk away with '' 
 after a brief conversation where i had to actually work to get her to understand this she finally agreed 
 a few days later abusive boy was back in the lab 
 i <unk> at him he came over ... hey that lady is going to lock up those cds 
 if you 're going to bring your laptop in and copy it you should probably bring it tonight 
 just make sure i '' m not in the room '' 
 he smiled and headed out of the room 
 about 30 minutes later it was time to close up the lab 
 i had taken to checking the software every night because i 'll be damned if it 's my neck on the line '' 
 lo and behold one of them was missing 
 i sighed 
 i knew what he had done 
 i had told him very specifically to bring his laptop in not to take the cd out trying to help the poor guy out right 
 the worst part about is that even though i knew it was him i could n't just leave knowing that there was a small chance it could have been someone else 
 i knew well enough that he 'd actually bring it back but if it were someone else it might never come back 
 i had to report it 
 i walked up to the main desk and reported the theft told campus security yes i know someone was in that room i know who it was 
 i doubt he took it all the same '' 
 hey i was n't too <unk> with the guy but i was n't about to pin it on him if i did n't have absolute proof and i did n't know for a fact just strongly suspected 
 campus security found him wandering around campus with the <unk> 
 he was kicked out of the college his senior year within the week with only 3 months left in the school year 
 turns out that for various reasons the money he spent there for classes was wasted because none of those credits were <unk> like i said the college was a <unk> <unk> is a story i debated whether to put in here or r/pettyrevenge 
 i decided this had some weight so ill put it here first but like there later on 
 this happened to me only this week so its nice and fresh in my mind 
 <unk> : ** in need of work i asked around to my friends and then found out through a good friend of a mine that there was a place opening up ideal location and industry for me 
 i had lengthy <unk> with the owner of this new franchise that was opening up 
 i had more business experience than him so i brought them up to speed and went above and beyond helping him out before i was even employed by them as long as i was guaranteed a job 
 this was a franchise job that was based around <unk> i would earn based on clients i would pull in 
 the job was supposed to start at the beginning of june 
 i had other <unk> but i started shuffling all of them to fit around this job because at least situation wise it was perfect even if the wage was average 
 june comes around and im still waiting to hear from the owner 
 **nothing** 
 i chase him up and get told the franchise is not going ahead 
 3 days later its suddenly going ahead again and so its all stations go from the end of july 
 fair enough <unk> can happen with new businesses 
 owner is worried about leaving his high paying job to take over secondary job in the franchise to help out as i would be only employee so i help out and reach out to friends with same skill set as myself so they can take his position and he gets to keep his high paying job 
 lets call owner d for douche and my friends <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> story : ** myself and <unk> get hired no contract yet important to start advertising and walking around with <unk> to advertise the new franchise 
 <unk> <unk> their other job because of <unk> of <unk> with the franchise 
 during this advertising we get asked by the local council to move on as its illegal under those laws to do what we were doing but with a permit it would be legal 
 pass this onto d and move on from the area 
 <unk> was interviewed and promised a job and work that myself and <unk> were already doing 
 they were waiting on schedules and contracts to start but d was <unk> and not answering phone calls 
 after the first <unk> to advertise i find out from <unk> that d has decided to replace her 3 years of study and 4 years of experience with a 18 year old girl 3 weeks study and no experience and d has also been <unk> my calls about this and the council 
 this being a job that <unk> had left her only source of income for that fell totally down because d likes young <unk> things <unk> was young and attractive but smart 
 <unk> anger stage 1. <unk> was not contacted at all for weeks until the same afternoon that <unk> was let go 
 telling her after <unk> a job that she would not be able to work for them after all and apparently d was <unk> on me to fill shifts with the young dumb thing 
 all of this he was doing behind my back after i had gone out of my way so many times to help him including getting these girls on board and us putting many things on hold to help him 
 anger stage 2. before i had found out what he had done to <unk> and <unk> d had tried to get me to do the exact same thing with the <unk> in a close region 
 i had protested as i had already been asked to leave the area before and d responded with & gt whats the worst they could do 
 send me a letter 
 he was pushing very hard so i went and looked up the law 
 i found out going back there especially after a warning i could be fined $ 5000 if not be <unk> <unk> 
 i told d of this and he attempted to force me to still do this work but of course would not do it himself 
 <unk> <unk> finally i find out about all above situations and then also notice that he has been out working for his franchise 
 d knowing im supporting a sick partner and struggling financially and even after going out of my way for months to help his business out and him as an individual with no pay he had decided to take every shift where a client could sign up and get commission which of course went straight into his pocket when he was already well off from his other job and refused to let me on board to do these other shifts 
 cutting me out of hundreds of dollars super <unk> 
 so for the revenge 
 * with the work he had tried to force me into i have all the copies of d 's marketing materials he would use to <unk> business for the future weeks 
 instead of blasting him about his unprofessional <unk> and general <unk> i decided to email him i got a better job with better benefits and that i would be passing all marketing material onto <unk> so she could keep encouraging business for him 
 of course i <unk> know at this stage he 's been a horrible douche to <unk> and go rid of her he 's faced with the choice of either having to personally confront her face to face after being a major dick to her or he <unk> thousands of dollars of marketing <unk> and material 
 * i am a member of a close <unk> community within my industry and immediately put out an <unk> that this owner was a dick and <unk> should work for him in any fashion and should in fact <unk> others to stay away from him 
 community is well respected and known within industry also should put out a notice to any potential clients or recent sign ups that they are likely to get messed around and treated poorly by said owner despite <unk> best intentions 
 last thing you need right as your trying to get a franchise off the ground end to even break even which i do know d was having trouble doing * my favorite part of the revenge 
 the friend i heard about this job from <unk> the same religious community that d does 
 i took great satisfaction in informing this friend of every single one of d 's antics and attitude including <unk> of him encouraging me to perform illegal activities and him not caring about me being fined etc 
 this friend is highly respected within his religious community and took it upon himself to inform the <unk> of the community of how d is not acting within any of the guidelines of the community and will be severely <unk> if not <unk> 
 this is also his entire network of personal friends who now get to find out just how poorly he treats those he would be responsible for 
 i would i have liked to do more but at least for now it will suffice 
 tl : dr franchise owner fucks me and my friends around after hours of unpaid work and so i go out of my way to ruin his reputation within the industry as well as within his personal reputation within his church <unk> someone posted a revenge story about lying to get a guy fired 
 the post had <unk> something points and has now been removed due to breaking rule 3 on the sidebar 
 as a reminder please keep stories <unk> 
 the post in question pretty much ruined a guy 's life based on a lie 
 there were also a lot of comments which had been reported and only one of them was actually spam the rest were just people disagreeing 
 please report comments and posts if they break any of the sidebar rules but please do n't report something just because you disagree with them and feel a <unk> is n't <unk> used to work in a martial arts supply store 
 the store was generally dead and i used to leave a sign up in the window that read back in 5 '' 
 there were a couple of customers who would just drop by to chat once in a while 
 one of them was named <unk> 
 <unk> had a <unk> background 
 we <unk> a couple of times and our respective <unk> made it pretty interesting 
 suffice to say he was fast 
 how fast 
 real fast 
 he dropped by my work for a chat one day and i decided to grab a coffee from across the street 
 cue the customary sign in the window 
 <unk> had come with one of those <unk> gas station plastic soda <unk> and had been sipping from it 
 i worked next to a very busy road and was <unk> between the two places where a <unk> could cross 
 well fuck the law 
 we waited until there was a pretty good gap in traffic and <unk> across 
 a car pulled up on one of the side streets when we were almost all of the way across and turned onto the road we were on and just <unk> it straight for us 
 engine at excessive <unk> that thing was loud 
 i picked up the pace and got out of its way but not <unk> 
 <unk> planted both of his feet in the middle of the road and i watched his <unk> start to <unk> from his neck as the driver had to rapidly apply his brakes and avoid <unk> 
 he <unk> and <unk> <unk> off 
 fast as shit <unk> <unk> that monstrosity he 'd been drinking from right at the car 
 dude 's window was down and i ca n't swear to it but i think he got <unk> 
 the driver <unk> and slowed 
 <unk> the damage or thinking about taking <unk> and i on no idea 
 <unk> turned to look at the car and i noticed that his eyes had become <unk> 
 that piece of shit <unk> along and we went for <unk> had a plan to get vengeance on an acquaintance who stole a shit ton of soda from my great uncle 's shop but recently gained proof and acted on it 
 so this asshole we 'll call him <unk> would come in to my great uncle 's shop i worked there for summer break would come in and walk <unk> around the shop and would disappear from the surveillance camera 's sight range momentarily 
 i purchased a sound receiving <unk> <unk> from target and set it up in a blind spot 
 almost a whole month passes then he comes in again and walks into the snack <unk> and begins to grab a 24 case of soda do n't know what kind and walks to the usual spot 
 he begins to shove it in his backpack <unk> and it would n't fit the bag 
 i walked over the area and see him trying to stuff this in his bag 
 i confront him and tell him he has to pay for the soda and never come back 
 he tells me he has no money on him and tries to tell me some sob story about his dead grandpa or something that made him steal 
 i <unk> the soda and put it back 
 i take his phone from his bag and call his parents and try get them to come down to the shop 
 his parents do n't answer and i leave a message 
 he leaves months pass and he is back with a friend 
 i tell him to leave and he walks back to the snack <unk> and begins to try and take more shit than last time still unaware of the camera 
 i tell him to stay away from the shop or i will call the cops but of course he is back again 
 i allow him in a few more times but steal all merchandise back from his bag every time he arrives 
 he and his fat friend would go next door and leave their bags here 
 when he keeps coming back enough becomes enough 
 i <unk> his arrival and take his bike from the rack and place it in the road 
 first me and my friend take turns scratching it and pouring gasoline on it 
 we run his friends bike over with my truck and burn the other 
 when they come back to the rack i throw them out permanently and threaten to slap their shit if they come back 
 i have n't heard from them <unk> off this is a throwaway account and a long post 
 i 've been <unk> to pettyrevenge for a while so i would think this story i 'm about to tell is more prorevenge than petty 
 this memory is still fresh in my mind because the revenge that the cooks took was absolutely disgusting and they later had my back on my subsequent revenge against the same manager 
 theirs was extremely gross and <unk> while mine <unk> restaurant operations for a couple days due to lack of water 
 this is my first post to this sub 
 a <unk> i do n't <unk> messing with anyone 's food 
 i never did when i finally rose the ranks and became a cook myself about a year or so later at a different restaurant in the chain 
 background : the year was mid to late <unk> 's and i was working as a <unk> in my late teens right after high school 
 i had just left from a cashier position at a local home improvement chain that was big in my area when i was living in that area 
 it was a <unk> of a local grocery store chain that has since <unk> into several states 
 the home improvement chain has since closed since home depot started <unk> at the time all over the country 
 anyways i quit that job and a friend got me a job at the restaurant 
 i applied for a <unk> job and during my interview the horrible gm asked if i did n't mind washing dishes for 2 weeks then he 'd let me go on to do <unk> 
 i thought that was a decent offer not knowing that he had absolutely no intentions of letting me do <unk> 
 not knowing that <unk> i took the job and ended up being a <unk> for a year 
 when i learned that the gm had no intentions of holding up his end of the deal i was furious but needed a job 
 <unk> <unk> at the 24 hour restaurant two cooks i 'll refer to as joe and mike were two guys who were <unk> and under appreciated 
 they 'd get in around late lunch had to work through dinner and bar shift until the early morning 
 these guys hated the gm 
 i was generally the <unk> on their shifts and they took to me as one of their own 
 it was because they were friends with my best friend at the time who helped me get the job i was the <unk> <unk> got them stacks of clean plates like clockwork always left the dishwashing station extremely clean when other dishwashers did n't i got shit if i even thought about leaving the area less than perfect while other dishwashers got away with being <unk> other dishwashers could call in sick but i could n't even if i was sick as a dog they knew about me getting <unk> on tips when i <unk> tables since i confided in them they knew about the gm screwing me over 
 basically these two cats really felt my pain 
 one day they had had enough and executed their revenge 
 **the revenge** one day the gm was being his usual asshole self to us and decided to order a cheeseburger or something of that nature from the <unk> for his break 
 joe and mike got into revenge mode 
 joe decides to <unk> the gm 's burger <unk> into a filthy <unk> bucket a few times will mike went to go take a shit 
 if your <unk> is running wild at this point as to where this is all going it should 
 joe throws the burger on the grill and lets it cook for a bit takes it off the grill and <unk> it a little more into the dirty <unk> bucket 
 mike finishes his business and after wiping his ass takes some shit off his toilet paper and <unk> it all over the top of the burger then throws some cheese on that bitch 
 they cook it to temp put it on some <unk> plates some fries and calls out to the server telling them the food was ready 
 all three of us stand in the galley and watch as the gm <unk> down the <unk> bucket shit smeared cheeseburger actually enjoying his food 
 <unk> thing i had ever witnessed in person 
 even though they <unk> the <unk> and <unk> from that day forward i refused to order food from the place while on break 
 i went to local <unk> to eat even though they told me i had nothing to worry about 
 tl dr : cooks get revenge on a horrible boss by fixing him up a <unk> bucket dipped shit smeared cheeseburger 
 supposedly the girl said she would get back at him somehow for all the lawsuits <unk> 's ex wife filed against her 
 i know this sub is just for stories of pro-revenge but this seems to be the biggest public revenge story ever 
 <unk> mill fine banned for life forced to sell 
 background : my friend <unk> sells a lot of weed and <unk> and has a very strong sense of justice 
 his friend of a few years <unk> is a real thug and just comes off like a real shady guy in my eyes 
 one day <unk> tells me to no small surprise that <unk> is refusing to pay a substantial sum of money to him 
 <unk> tells all his friends that <unk> is threatening him and all sorts of things to keep their friends on <unk> 's side 
 <unk> then says that if <unk> ever tries to get his money back that he will call the cops in on his operation very easy considering <unk> 's family <unk> 
 <unk> asks for my <unk> in getting some revenge and i tell him that i 'm not prepared to do what he asked but to keep me in the loop if i can help some other way 
 some time down the road <unk> asks me about a guy i know jim and whether i can trust him 
 i tell him i should be able to and he lets me in on his plan 
 <unk> has got a substantial amount of <unk> that was grown in a <unk> and basically left to <unk> for itself 
 most of the <unk> got <unk> and the end product would have been near impossible to smoke 
 never the less he kept the rotten stuff and <unk> it very quickly in a food <unk> 
 it was n't <unk> but it was still incriminating 
 then he let me know that jim was family friends with <unk> 's family and had been left in charge of house sitting while the family was on vacation 
 jim makes a call to <unk> and says that some guy called <unk> came round to pick up his stuff '' 
 <unk> <unk> into action and soon enough the police are investigating <unk> for claims of <unk> trespassing and dealing weed 
 they quickly found that <unk> had been at a wedding and visiting family in the time that this had happened and after being invited into his property they found nothing out of the ordinary 
 then the police came to check <unk> 's house 
 jim of course told them that the only call he had with <unk> in that time frame was about the family dog and when the police check <unk> 's room even though the door was still looked they find a large quantity of pretty nasty pretty illegal <unk> 
 <unk> is under investigation right now and it seems that the cops have found out he is dealing coke and <unk> 
 <unk> never got his money back but all of <unk> and <unk> 's mutual friends are now coming to <unk> for business which means he is making more than ever 
 i ca n't say i <unk> any of this but i did feel that while it was <unk> it was good to see that <unk> 's violent threats were met with a <unk> revenge than vandalism or <unk> awhile ago i posted asking for help long story short the estate agents did n't own one of the fridges the seven tenants of the house just <unk> it on to the next set of tenants for <unk> each year and this year the 7 <unk> lads moving in flat out refused to pay 
 since making the post one of my housemates heard them talking about <unk> a free fridge so that confirmed my suspicion they were just calling our bluff and trying to get it for free rather than just not <unk> i <unk> to donate it somewhere no one offered to take it from <unk> before we left and the local places either charged <unk> or so collection fee would n't take an old fridge or would only take it if <unk> could get it to the place and the problem in the first place was that i had no way of moving it myself 
 so sadly no one <unk> from a fridge however i have hopefully made sure the new tenants can use it as nothing but <unk> 
 based on the suggestions in my original thread the day i left i turned everything off and cleaned it all out nice and neatly 
 then took absolutely everything that could be removed from it 
 the <unk> now has no shelves in the main part or the door 
 because they could still just use it to <unk> beer or something i <unk> the rubber band <unk> thing in a dozen or so places i have no idea if it 'll do anything but fingers crossed it 'll make it <unk> cold constantly 
 the girl who moved in first out of us said it was still full of junk when she moved in which means the estate agents do n't look inside which is great because i lined both doors with half a tube of superglue that we 'd used to fix a chair 
 finally even though people said it would be too easy to fix i cut the power <unk> almost completely through left a little wiring still attached right up near the base of the fridge hopefully they wo n't even notice until they manage to pry open the door 
 tl : dr * new tenants refused to pay for a fridge as per everyone else had done also found out they were in fact calling our bluff and expecting to get it for free 
 * cut the power cable near the base it 's not <unk> and is still attached but should burn out after a little use 
 * removed all the shelves and <unk> things inside there is nothing but the floor of the fridge and freezer <unk> to put stuff on * cut the rubber <unk> on the door all over the place 
 * <unk> the door shut 
 enjoy 
 asshole students 
 <unk> this goes here as he got a <unk> fine and jail time 
 so on to the story ... after a baseball game we stop in a <unk> to get some food 
 we get our food and get into my dad 's truck 
 and indian guy pulls in next to us and throws his door open <unk> my dad 's car 
 well my dad <unk> dents for living so no big deal really 
 except this guy kept trying to blame the wind 
 they start arguing and this guy just will not let my dad just say just give me $ 60 for my time and ill fix it myself '' and begins swearing at me and my brother very young and not involved at all and my dad damn near starts a fight with this guy and he shouts call the cops they will defend me '' 
 so my dad does 
 <unk> forward 15 min 
 and an <unk> cop car pulls in 
 one cop gets out starts asking questions 
 he gets both sides and asks me and my brother for what happened 
 we told him everything and he starts writing this guy a ticket 
 the indian guy says i fucking hate cops '' and gives the cop the finger 
 my dad tells the cop but he didnt see it so no crime 
 <unk> ... * the <unk> cop who saw it all steps out <unk> out to put on this guy 
 indian dude tries to pull away and run and all three large dudes grab this scrawny <unk> shit and <unk> him 
 they send my dad on his way and as we pull out in the rear seat of indian dude 's car i see <unk> 
 for a girl 's 3rd birthday 
 my dad fixed the <unk> himself it would have cost 100 dollars for anyone else 
 the indian got booked for some stuff regarding minors resisting arrest and a few others 
 probably a couple days in the <unk> and a good couple hundred dollars in fines 
 edit : when he was getting <unk> he apparently make some kind of threat towards the officer citing him and my father and i <unk> making his crime much more <unk> sentence story from a friend this <unk> the other day i was taking my girlfriend to work on my lunch break because her car broke down 
 because it was my lunch i was strapped for time 
 i was speeding not <unk> on the <unk> about 10 mph over and right as i am passing a big rig he ** the asshole not the big rig ** cuts me off doing 5 mph under the speed limit 
 he proceeds to tap his brakes just to be an asshole so i go around him and get in front of him 
 doing this somehow upset the man and he decided to follow me 
 me being the nice guy that i am waited until we were on the <unk> between two <unk> to break check him to the point where he had to <unk> to stop in time 
 me and my girlfriend let out a chuckle and continued to go to her work 
 she works at a restaurant right across from the mall in our town 
 so not wanting this crazy to know where she works i take her to the closest spot near her work and tell her to walk straight across the 6 lane intersection and i will ditch this dude 
 she does this and at this point he caught up to me and rolls down his window yelling at me trying to get me to get out of my car 
 i simply do n't have time for this <unk> so i plan to lose him through the city my hometown before heading back onto the <unk> and going back to work 
 as soon as i pull out of the parking lot there is a motorcycle cop right in front of me 
 so i <unk> at him does n't phase him so i honk 
 he <unk> over to the lane next to me and stops at the red light 
 i roll down the window hey buddy there is this crazy guy in the brown truck a couple cars back that is trying to fight me or something 
 he cut me off on the <unk> a few miles back and followed me to the mall where i had to drop my girlfriend off for work 
 i do n't have time to deal with this guy right now 
 can you help me out '' 
 his response was the <unk> '' 
 i nod thank him and drive off 
 looking in my <unk> i see the cop wait for him to catch up to me then immediately light his ass up 
 i immediately pull my phone out to call my girlfriend to inform her of how awesome that <unk> 2013 myself and a large group of friends went to a music festival 
 there was one girl with us i 'll call her rachel ... <unk> that was her name 
 who was not a part of the <unk> group of friends 
 she was a friend of one of the people in the group but none of the rest of us had ever met her 
 so we get to the mountain and set up camp 
 my friends and i decide to go see a dj 
 rachel does her own thing and <unk> from us 
 we arrive at the very top of the mountain and have fun for a few hours and decide to return to camp 
 when we return we all <unk> rachel straight up in my tent looking for <unk> 
 however this was not my first <unk> and i made sure to keep my camera all prescription <unk> etc 
 in a backpack and with me at all times 
 the entire group immediately confronted her 
 she was making excuses that were <unk> <unk> saying that she was on drugs and had gotten confused and thought that she was in her own tent 
 her tent looked and had an interior nothing like mine though 
 the most <unk> example was that mine had a sleeping bag inside it and hers had an air mattress 
 there were many other examples and during the course of the confrontation her story <unk> so we all knew that she was lying 
 fast forward about 24 hours in the future 
 rachel is sleeping <unk> in her tent 
 now another friend of mine is a new mother and has a <unk> pump on her 
 she has been <unk> for the last 24 hours and putting the milk into a jar saving it 
 we go in her tent where she is asleep and my friend pours her half rancid <unk> milk all over this chick 's face 
 but we are not done with the revenge there 
 rachel did not wake up after having milk <unk> on her so i go back in there and grab her bag 
 i never had any intent of stealing anything out of it that 's just not me 
 but i did take it into a <unk> <unk> and took a huge dump in it and then returned it to her tent 
 about 6 hours later she wakes up and grabs her purse and exits her tent and we are all really mean to her ... .so she packs up all of her stuff and leaves the festival never noticing that her purse is full of poop 
 we all had a great laugh session over this and it is kind of a big deal type story around where i live 
 <unk> not my story but a family members who i shall call tommy 
 tommy was in a bar in the united states about 10 years ago to watch a college football game with a bunch of business partners 
 the bar was very <unk> and while outside smoking a fight broke out nearby 
 the <unk> bouncers started <unk> people around and tommy who was just standing there innocently got tossed 
 literally tossed 
 he fell over a railing onto concrete about 6 feet down 
 he <unk> his face broke his hand and when he tried to get back in to get his possessions was told to fuck off before he was arrested 
 his friend tried to get his jacket from their table inside but it was gone 
 i do n't know if he pursued <unk> action but i assume he did and was <unk> 
 otherwise the following tale would not have occurred 
 fast forward 3 years 
 <unk> healed after a few expensive <unk> and new jacket purchased but tommy still <unk> a burning desire for revenge deep inside 
 he finds out he will be going back to the area for business he lived elsewhere 
 just so happens that the super bowl will be <unk> this same weekend 
 so tommy starts to plan 
 and what he comes up with is perfect 
 on super bowl sunday following a week of successful business he shows up at the bar 
 it is near the end of the first half game very close with a bag <unk> his supplies at his side 
 everyone is <unk> by the <unk> of the game and he <unk> off to the <unk> room 
 it 's a ghost town 
 inside he quickly <unk> dish gloves and starts <unk> up the sinks and <unk> them 
 he <unk> tennis balls inside the toilets and <unk> them all the way inside and <unk> them to <unk> as well 
 i am not exactly sure the extent of work that went on beyond this but he did something to make the water flow <unk> and was difficult to stop 
 soon there is an <unk> of <unk> <unk> dumping onto the floors 
 work complete he exits the bathroom and takes up a vantage point nearby 
 <unk> <unk> blows and everyone rushes for the bathroom with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> blasting through <unk> 
 <unk> are full and must be emptied 
 he could only <unk> on what occurred inside but its quite apparent that it 's <unk> fuck 
 guys come running out shoes wet and <unk> <unk> down <unk> for other places to piss 
 there are staff running around trying to stop the <unk> and get the toilets <unk> while still serving the packed bar but it is too late 
 the scene becomes more <unk> and tommy proud and satisfied with himself <unk> away 
 i believe they had to shut down the bar for the night after that 
 there was a lot of water damage and revenue lost 
 i do n't know if there is a moral to this story maybe keep your dogs on a leash or never <unk> fuck over a paying <unk> 
 i do know that tommy is a cold calculating mother fucker and he takes great pride in this 
 either way i know who i am consulting if i ever need to exact revenge 
 tl dr tommy gets seriously injured by bouncer comes back years later and <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> thousands in <unk> there 's so many stories that get posted to here with many saying it belongs in /r/pettyrevenge and <unk> why is n't there a sub just called <unk> 
 that would <unk> a lot of <unk> on which post goes where and such 
 x -- posted from /r/pettyrevenge so this is something i do whenever i get one of those im out of town my assistant is going to send you a <unk> order '' scams 
 if you dont know how this scam works they send you a fraudulent check or money order and you deposit into your bank hoping that you will give them the item that day when it usually takes a bank a few days to catch that its fraudulent 
 i accept that i will take the <unk> order 
 and have them send it to a certain address see images for address 
 <unk> times they send it and ive been contacted by the fbi looking for more information 
 sorry for the <unk> host - <unk> doesnt like my computer or vice <unk> : image 1 image 2 update 1 seriously i 'm not trying to be a jerk but i do n't get <unk> guess my son was in the second or third grade <unk> 1998 and there was this kid <unk> that picked on him constantly 
 fairly certain the <unk> was n't physical as my son was big for his age and taking martial arts 
 it was mainly verbal stuff name calling etc 
 the kid was a handful because i remember his desk was on the other side of the room from the other students and he ate lunch isolated 
 anyway me son went to a different middle school than <unk> so there was a break in time when he around this kid 
 so a few years pass and my son had been playing football for several years as a <unk> playing both ways 
 so you see where this is headed 
 one beautiful fucking day <unk> shows up late to practice and a few days into the start of practices 
 i was <unk> as hell 
 my son to this day is very mild <unk> so i was wondering what was going to happen 
 well i guess the gods of karma were with him this fine day 
 damned if they did n't put <unk> across from my son on the line 
 i honestly do n't remember whether he was playing <unk> or <unk> but when they snapped the ball my boy ran over <unk> like he was a <unk> <unk> 
 this happened a few more times until <unk> would ran away from my son like he was <unk> an axe 
 needless to say that was <unk> 's last practice 
 my ex and i broke up in may of last year 
 recently i hooked up my computer for the first time to the internet 
 my current boyfriend was cleaning up a lot of junk from it for me and came across a <unk> logged in 
 he thought it was mine it was pictures of me and my ex 
 after looking through it more we found hundreds and hundreds of pictures my ex took of girls without their permission 
 women bent over at work <unk> office water theme park <unk> park 
 we also found pictures he 'd taken of girls underage around the age of 10. all the <unk> were <unk> but they were all <unk> in on their butt or chest or crotch area 
 <unk> 
 i 'm so <unk> out 
 i filed a police report they are going to charge him with <unk> in 2 different <unk> where the pics were taken 
 i contacted his ex wife know because they share custody of their daughter 
 now a cps case worker is going to contact me to get details 
 i also reported him to hr at his work and they are investigating and if found guilty he will be fired as well 
 to clarify i 'm happy he 's going to get what he deserves 
 people like this do n't get caught often enough 
 my ex was abusive to me and verbally abusive to my daughter 
 if he has no problem hitting women treating kids like he does and taking photos the way he did what else is he willing to do 
 will it escalate to more then that 
 sounds like the <unk> of a rapist to me 
 he ruined his own life 
 karma is a bitch 
 to the people who think he did n't do anything illegal : i 'm in <unk> state btw <unk> <unk> <unk>

 5 if a person is convicted of a violation of this section the court may order the destruction of any photograph motion picture film digital image <unk> or any other recording of an image that was made by the person in violation of this <unk> 2009 when i was 16 years old i started talking to a man i had met online let 's call him b b was 24 at the time about to be <unk> we met through the <unk> tour message boards and hit it off pretty quickly 
 we would send long <unk> to each other all day everyday 
 we had a lot of the same interests i enjoyed talking to him and i thought he was extremely cute 
 i naturally started to like him but once i found out his age i knew he 'd just see me as <unk> and i got upset 
 at the time like all 16 year olds think i thought i was mature for my age and i was different which in some ways i was 
 i had been through a lot but i still was n't mentally grown and that 's okay nobody really has to be at that age 
 eventually we met b drove all the way to <unk> from michigan to see me 
 he won over my grandma whom i lived with despite how old he was he 's really good at that 
 the women in my family always dated older anyway so in a way they thought they did n't have much to say 
 for the first year and a half we dated long distance b would come to see me about every three weeks and we talked constantly when he was n't around i truly thought this was something that would last 
 when i was 17 b proposed to me in a best buy parking lot and i thought i was going to spend the rest of my life with him 
 when i was just shy of 18 i dropped out of high school and moved to michigan to live with him and his mother since i did n't like where i lived and had a lot of family problems 
 all was fine and <unk> for a while b and i formed a serious band together 
 i had always wanted to sing in a band it was always very important to me but i was never a good singer but the plan was to get vocal lessons and work my hardest to improve 
 i started to not wan na be with him anymore in early 2011 so i spoke to him about it and he told me that if i left him he would have to kick me out of the band and the band was so important to me that i tried for the next few years to work it out 
 i was unhappy pretty much the entire time but anytime i tried to leave him he would bring up the band or bring up the fact that him or i would never find anyone better for each other and if i left him i 'd probably regret it so i stayed out of fear 
 when i got around to 20 years old i really started to <unk> him he 's extremely immature for his age and everything that made him cool when i was 16 made him annoying to me now 
 the band went on to do a lot we recorded studio <unk> went on tour played <unk> tour etc 
 i became a much better singer than i was at the start i took four years and counting vocal lessons with a <unk> nominated instructor and i became someone he took seriously as a singer 
 i worked my ass off 
 last year i started to become very depressed with where i was at in life i still did n't drive because nobody would take the time to teach me and i did n't have family out here i could n't hold a job because b would have us doing useless <unk> and the more we <unk> the worse the <unk> got i remember playing to many empty rooms and feeling hopeless 
 i started liking other people i met this one guy and sadly ended up cheating on b and i 'm not proud of it but after that i realized i needed to get out of my relationship with b i just felt scared and trapped and realized i was pretty emotionally manipulated by him at this point 
 i confessed what i had done to b and told him we should break up at the time i was still living with him and he said as long as i payed rent i could continue to live there and we would still be in the band together and be good friends it would just take time but he wanted me to get back on my feet 
 b cried over me for about a week and then started liking this other girl we 'll call her m m was 17 years old and by now he was 30 years old i was shocked but i should n't of been because i was 16 and he was 25 when we first got together 
 i was actually friends with m at first she had became a fan of our band about a year prior and i always thought she was cool her and i shared the same views on a lot of things or so i thought 
 b and m were happy together it was pretty messed up but i decided that since b was so mentally immature that maybe it was okay and i wanted to see him happy because i had still felt bad for <unk> on b at the time 
 not too long after b and m started to get on my nerves she would come over to the duplex b and i lived at and she would hang out with him and i would usually leave because the duplex had no doors and i wanted to give them alone time 
 one night i set up a date during the same time and day so they could be alone i did n't have an issue with that because i liked them both and was happy for them 
 my clothes were still in b 's room so while i was about to get dressed i went over to kind of let them know beforehand that i was gon na come in real quick to get my clothes so i could get dressed i <unk> over a tiny bit and they were both laying in his bed with no shirts i found it pretty disrespectful and i was upset because i made plans to leave the house for them 
 after that situation things had settled down between everyone or so i thought 
 things went alright for a week or two after that and i was told i had to leave every wednesday from <unk> - 3pm so they had some time together i think she was sneaking to see him between classes 
 normally i would n't mind except one week i had the flu but my ex still forced me out and i sat in a coffee shop for three hours since i could n't find anyone to <unk> with me and i was n't driving at the time 
 not too long after that m absolutely lost her shit with me she started posting things on her <unk> about how i 'm a cunt and i 'm never going to do anything with myself and was trying to force b to throw me out and i at the time had nowhere else to go considering going back to my abusive family was n't an option 
 b did his best to stay neutral which i appreciated but that also did n't last long 
 soon after he gave me a move out date of june 1st and it was around march at the time so i had <unk> months to get my shit together i was a little nervous but i hoped i could do it 
 at least b was giving me three months instead of listening to m and kicking me out as soon as possible 
 one night b and i got into a fight pretty badly i do n't really remember what it was about but i 'm sure it had something to do with anything i posted above 
 i lost my temper and told him i was n't going to leave the apartment for m and him tomorrow and he told me that if i did n't i could get the fuck out '' and that i were not eat any of the food in the house and i could fucking <unk> '' 
 i was at my <unk> end with this bullshit especially coming from a 30 year old man a man eight years older than me <unk> to his cry baby brat 17 year old girlfriend so i told him to stop messing with me or he would regret it 
 he laughed in my face and told me to try 
 so i went to bed and laid there and thought of exactly what i was going to do and i thought of the perfect plan and the next day i would set everything into motion 
 the next day she came over during her usual time and i left without a fight 
 when i got back she was just about to leave and he was about to go to work i believe he was closing that night or at least working late so i had a lot of time 
 i start my plan by going through his ipad and getting every evidence i could to show how disturbing he was 
 of course his password was the day they started dating so getting into it was no issue 
 i read so many texts about how awful i was and how they did n't care if i got kicked out i was furious but i kept my cool 
 i also listened to a lot of voice texts where he talked to her like she was a 6 year old girl and it was very creepy <unk> though because he used to do it to me 
 he also hundreds of screen <unk> <unk> from her including a few nudes which is very illegal 
 i took all this information and gave my mom a call at this time we had forgave each other for our abusive past relationship she was a little in the loop about what was happening and i knew she was a smooth <unk> so i told her that maybe she should give m 's mom a call and let her know exactly how creepy b actually is since m still lives with her parents 
 the next step was finding m 's mother 's phone number we 'll call her j j was one of those people who had her phone number in her facebook about me '' perfect 
 i was hoping it was the right number i sent it to my mom and my mom told me she would call me back and let me know what went down 
 i <unk> waited for about 40 minutes and then the phone rings it 's my mom 
 my mom was on the phone with her mom for 40 minutes talking about the entire history of b and how b <unk> young girls and though j knew it all along she did n't wan na <unk> the relationship and push m closer to <unk> so after my mom called j j wanted to speak with me 
 i also went over my relationship with b to j and covered how manipulative controlling and creepy b was and i also told her all the texts i read 
 as soon as m got home that day j told her that if she continued to see b she would kick her out of the house take her car and not pay for her <unk> 
 so m broke it off with b and apologized to me 
 for the next few whenever i was around m i would poison the well and remind her how awful b was every time 
 b was miserable for awhile and it was fun to watch since he made me so miserable i thought it was good karma 
 they never ended up getting back together even though m wishes she could i think b is over it at this point but i 'm just glad i gave myself a little more time to get back on my feet and proved to b not to mess with me 
 b still goes after young girls sadly that will never change he likes to find girls he can manipulative and <unk> into exactly what he is 
 **tl dr : my ex in his 30 's goes after a young girl again they tried to kick me out on the streets so i tell her mom everything and her mom makes her daughter break up with him 
 ** edit : formatting i was unaware this sub existed thought i 'd share with anyone who did n't see the thread in <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> threw bleach on my clothes in the dryer and she got what was coming to her 
 * i joined the air force in 2010 and went to my first duty station in <unk> i was stationed at <unk> air base 
 anyway between joining and getting to <unk> tech <unk> usually spend much more on nice things then they probably should 
 i too fell into this trap 
 i had been poor for the last few years so having a steady income was great 
 i purchased neat shirts with a bunch of air force and career field <unk> on it 
 well i settled in nicely to my first duty station made some friends and even had a girlfriend 
 things were pretty good 
 girls sometimes very <unk> end up in petty <unk> 
 my girlfriend was not immune to this 
 this girl we 'll call her <unk> was <unk> fighting with my girlfriend <unk> 
 one day someone stole <unk> 's <unk> jacket out of the dryer while she was away from her laundry 
 this was n't uncommon people left their laundry in the community laundry room and accomplished errands on their day off 
 unfortunately because of the fighting between my <unk> and <unk> my girlfriend was probably first to be blamed 
 i can <unk> that she never had her <unk> because 1 she had her own and 2 i never saw a third <unk> around either my room or hers 
 anyway sometime in the early spring of 2012 <unk> decided to get back at <unk> for not stealing her <unk> jacket 
 <unk> decided to get some of my laundry done and because she was a night shift worker she did her laundry overnight 
 like a great girlfriend she threw in some of my things too including my <unk> and <unk> tech school t-shirts 
 when <unk> joined me in bed for a bit before i woke up early in the morning this is when she planned to pull my laundry out and give me a fresh <unk> to wear to work <unk> threw bleach in the dryer on mostly my clothes ruining it all 
 i suppose it could have been anyone 
 <unk> said she had seen her up and about while <unk> was doing stuff and hanging out with other <unk> 
 later on we did catch wind from one of her <unk> friends that gave us some <unk> evidence to further our <unk> nothing concrete however 
 my clothes were ruined 
 <unk> lost some stuff too unfortunately it was mostly my stuff 
 there was n't much room for <unk> because i did n't have any concrete proof and my first sergeant the sympathetic uncle in the military family if you will who has some pull between family members was <unk> to do much about it 
 <unk> fast forward to about an hour ago <unk> 
 <unk> my now ex-girlfriend <unk> who is still on good terms with me messages me out of the blue 
 they 're currently deployed together somewhere in the desert 
 she had this to say to me : hey just wanted to tell u what happened to me today ... <unk> is deployed with me and someone was doing laundry today ... just letting u know when she walked away i kinda maybe spilled a little bleach in her washing machine 
 thought that would make ya smile 
 <unk> '' today justice was <unk> i was in 7th grade this kid was telling others i was a <unk> 
 i couldnt get him to stop so i resorted to <unk> measures 
 i had a pencil in my hand 
 now its not what you think - id been suspended several other times for defending myself from bullies and i had no intentions whatsoever of causing any real harm or anything 
 the fucking pencil had no lead and you couldnt write with it or anything 
 if i had hit him anywhere else with it i <unk> you nothing would have <unk> 
 but me being a stupid fucker i accidentally hit him in an <unk> on his arm 
 the stupid pencil is <unk> on like glue and blood is literally <unk> 6 inches in the air like a fucking movie 
 somebody even fainted 
 long story short i get a 2 week suspension <unk> to 3 days he gets a 2 week suspension and counseling 
 also when i was suspended because i wasnt in school i was allowed to go with my dad to a <unk> air show nearby 
 upon return lots of people told me thanks for doing that to the kid as he was the token <unk> '' of our <unk> 've spent many years working in the general <unk> industry 
 basically working with private <unk> the crews and the <unk> 
 because of my location we get a lot of political activity every four years 
 as the various <unk> get out and start traveling around it 's in large part a <unk> 
 they are on standard <unk> <unk> and not much is required in terms of special handling 
 that all changes when one of these folks becomes the '' candidate 
 now they 're rolling around on commercial jet <unk> <unk> they have a bunch of staff and the <unk> protection to go along with it 
 ok no problem 
 our crew was very experienced did a lot of large <unk> sports <unk> and serious <unk> work 
 we had all the appropriate equipment to service these <unk> ie : <unk> trucks <unk> carts belt <unk> etc 
 we also knew how big these <unk> are and how to <unk> and park them on the <unk> 
 believe it or not at this level <unk> handling is an art 
 there 's no straight line or jet way to pull up to 
 you basically get one chance to get it right 
 in this last <unk> cycle we were getting the challenger to the <unk> in very regularly 
 like one to three times a week 
 ok a little bit of a hassle but from an <unk> <unk> no big deal 
 by and large everyone involved was reasonable and friendly 
 the issues came about due to the fact that the members of the protection detail were always changing 
 this was especially true of the agents in charge 
 my understanding from talking to them is that they were on a set <unk> schedule to keep everyone fresh and on their toes 
 as far as we were concerned a simple <unk> with the <unk> about the details for the day was sufficient 
 we would be clear on what they needed and we would handle the <unk> <unk> 
 this usually <unk> around how many cars busses equipment trucks etc. that they had and where we were going to put them 
 remember along with this we 're also trying to handle a constant flow of regular <unk> <unk> coming and going 
 so coming up with a <unk> <unk> plan was pretty key 
 all is well and good until one day <unk> richard <unk> is on the case 
 he was n't particularly old but he reminded me a lot of <unk> <unk> pepper <unk> state <unk> 
 from the bond movies 
 you know the type alright alright everybody stand back 
 i 'm in charge here 
 the other <unk> lead and myself just looked at each other in an oh great ... '' kind of way 
 it was either this guys way or the highway 
 he did n't want to hear or discuss anything about anything 
 ok fine whatever 
 so the plane comes in empty to pick up the candidate 
 we get the plane fueled and serviced two sets of truck <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk> for loading luggage into both holds the whole deal 
 plane is ready and waiting 
 easy <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 so the press busses and the <unk> truck arrive 
 no problems everything going well 
 get them on the plane bags loaded cool 
 now i do n't know what this guy 's last assignment was but this was n't <unk> where all the principal has to do is get out of the car and get on the plane and go 
 this candidate was always coming with several cars staff members additional luggage <unk> stuff etc 
 nothing unusual or unexpected 
 well once we had the plane serviced this <unk> went took it up about a thousand <unk> with the i 'm in charge '' bit 
 when he got the call that the <unk> was 15 minutes out he decided that he was going to <unk> the entire <unk> and make it a <unk> area 
 no <unk> <unk> or <unk> about it 
 the <unk> was now off limits to anybody who was n't approved and none of us were approved 
 as we were very familiar with this particular operation i calmly tried to inform him that the principal always had additional items for the plane etc 
 nope 
 nope 
 everything 's on the plane they just need the candidate 
 <unk> ok i think it may be wise ... nope <unk> area not <unk> stay out i 'm in charge here 
 ok buddy 
 you 've got it 
 with a big ass smile 
 i had really had it with this guy at this point i could see the hole he was digging for himself and felt our team had done all we could to avoid the coming problems 
 so sure enough 
 the <unk> arrives 10 <unk> 's luggage boxes of <unk> stuff and other crap 
 this is where we would usually be standing by to unload the cars and get everything on the belt <unk> and into the <unk> holds 
 as we were n't there the folks in the cars just dumped it all on the <unk> 
 realizing that nothing was happening the protective detail now starts grabbing the stuff and trying to figure out how to get it on the plane 
 meanwhile 10 of us were just standing there in our glass line office watching smiling loving it 
 right about then <unk> richard <unk> starts losing his mind 
 not only did his guys have to try and load the plane he was now realizing that the plane still had equipment all over it 
 he rushes into the building and starts getting on one of our <unk> 's about how we 're messing him up and he can see us all standing around with our thumbs up our butts '' 
 finally i walk out to the desk and calmly yet somewhat <unk> ask him what the problem is and ask if i can help him 
 guy is literally <unk> at the mouth and starts going off about the bags and the trucks and the equipment and why are we all standing around 
 at that point i smile politely and remind him that he had personally restricted the <unk> and ordered my staff out of the area 
 of course i am here to help him and if he wants to <unk> his prior position i was confident that i could find some staff to finish loading the <unk> and remove the equipment so that they could <unk> 
 he just <unk> at me and said do it '' 
 two minutes later the plane is secure the equipment is gone and plane is <unk> up 
 have a nice day 
 <unk> bye so i was in my 20 's and had a good group of friends 
 we <unk> hung out at one guys house on weekends 
 his dad was rich and had a epic party house 
 there about 20 to 30 people there every weekend 
 one asshat started showing up friend of a friend kinda deal 
 well the guy he always came with moved away but asshat kept coming over on <unk> he was a fast drunk and turned insulting and mean to people he didnt know that well and always rude to the girls that where <unk> we got tired of him fast and when he got drunk he would sleep in his car till the morning 
 at least he didnt drive drunk .. to get rid of him one night my friends and i decided on a <unk> asshat came over on sat like normal drank and got rude with in a few hours like normal went to sleep in his car like <unk> but this time when he was sleeping in his car we disconnected the battery from the car and taped black plastic <unk> over all the <unk> i left about midnight but i heard the next morning he was screaming in his car for about 5 min till he figured how to get out in pitch black 
 asshat even called the cops to report my friends 
 cops came and they told cops what they <unk> cops laughed and said there was nothing they could <unk> never saw asshat <unk> do you do when the person making <unk> life a misery at a company is the general manager who reports directly to the owners 
 very little is the actual answer 
 even here in the <unk> where we have pretty good employment laws 
 everyone becomes so afraid of losing their job that no-one speaks out 
 this guy is the sort to come out onto the floor and shout directly into your face if he has some problem with you 
 a little man who came over from india with nothing but a <unk> and an incredible attitude 
 his parents live in india in a house with <unk> so i suspect he has seen power in action 
 he believed that british men were lazy and did n't want to work 
 he passed down <unk> like no-one is allowed to talk about anything except business unless it is break time 
 i saw him shout at a young girl once 
 she was a single mother 
 he was shouting that the only reason he did n't fire her was because the child had no father to support it 
 that kind of bullshit everywhere on a daily basis 
 my revenge 
 i 'm not sure whether this is pro or petty revenge but it felt good at the time 
 the handle to his office was one of those round ones just a ball of metal 
 on <unk> i blew ink from two <unk> onto a piece of card and rubbed it on the <unk> of his door handle ... gave it a nice coating of thick blue pen ink 
 i was n't there to see it next morning but he unlocked his door and put his keys back in the pocket of his nice cream sports jacket 
 ink all down the side panel 
 man he blew a <unk> that day 
 and because he did n't initially know where the ink had come from he managed to get more of it on his shirt once he took his jacket off 
 everyone was talking about it for days ... although i never could take the credit at the <unk> just a quick one from my <unk> friends <unk> of revenge 
 same guy as <unk> ... oh the stories i can tell 
 so ... my friend is all dressed up and ready for a night at the club 
 <unk> at the pub have been done and the whole group is feeling super happy and looking forward to a night of dancing and more 
 everyone gets to the club usual cue and wait to get in 
 they let the girls go in first together and the the guys go to follow 
 one of the bouncers <unk> that my friend is <unk> drunk to go in and even though all the girls and the other guys that just went in in front of him were fine he ca n't go in 
 so it 's too late and everyone else has already paid to get in and he 's left in the cold out in the street 
 not taking a kicking lying down my friend <unk> a plan 
 he heads around the back of the club down the <unk> and jumps the fence into the back area 
 it is closed up and dark but he soon finds what he 's looking for 
 using a bit of wood lying around he smashes the lock handle of the electricity breaker box and opens it up ... then he turned off all of the power switches for the whole building in seconds 
 he said the screaming that came from inside the club was insane 
 quickly he jumped the fence and headed back down the alley to the front of the club 
 by this time people are streaming out and he <unk> around with them until he met up with his friends 
 they headed off for a different club and had a great time 
 i do n't know if he told the people he was with what he did that night but it really would n't surprise me if he never said a word 
 i worked at a <unk> for my first job as a fountain guy meaning i <unk> up and served <unk> shakes <unk> cakes etc 
 i worked with <unk> basically 
 it was definitely a sweet gig for my first job 
 one beautiful spring day i am invited to the birthday party of a girl i know 
 this girl was particularly special to me because we were basically in that stage that comes before a relationship you know 
 like where both of you know that you 're going to date soon 
 so you can imagine that going to her birthday party was important to me 
 her and i are still together by the way 
 the problem with going to her birthday party is that i worked that day 
 i started asking about for a co-worker to cover my shift 
 no one that worked there regularly could cover it for me however my manager informs me of one guy who might be able to cover my shift 
 we 'll call him douche 
 douche does n't work at the <unk> anymore but he still covers shifts when he is able comes in maybe three or four times a year 
 i call up douche who is my last hope at this point and ask him to cover my shift because i 've got my girlfriend 's birthday party to attend 
 he says he 'll do it and i was <unk> 
 fast forward to the day of my girlfriend 's party and douche sends me a text saying he ca n't make it because he <unk> developed <unk> on the day of 
 i 'm suspicious so i call him and ask him to tell me what 's up 
 he lied 
 he was too high to go into work 
 douche then asks me to tell the managers for him 
 oh sure douche 
 no problem 
 thanks for being honest man '' 
 i went to my girlfriend 's birthday party anyway 
 douche knew he had a <unk> and decided to get high regardless so he deserves whatever he gets for being that moronic 
 not only that but he calls me on the day of my prior engagement and <unk> me to drop everything because he could n't resist the urge to roll a blunt 
 i threw him to the <unk> managers happily 
 he lost his <unk> 
 i was pleased 
 tl dr - asked a guy to cover my shift for work to go to my girlfriend 's birthday calls me saying he is too high to go on the day of i get him fired from his <unk> part-time <unk> 6 years ago 
 in my new town in the <unk> suburb of happy <unk> 
 in june 2010 i closed on my down size house in the town next to where i been living most of my life 
 2 kids were gone and the other 2 were on their way to jobs and <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> and i bought the final house for working and then our retirement 
 things were good 
 within 2 weeks of closing i was diagnosed with <unk> cancer and my knee broke down and required a replacement 
 i was walking with a <unk> especially when doing stairs 
 i took to driving my car around the back of my house because the back steps were only 2 instead of the 4 steps in the front 
 almost immediately the code enforcement officer got on my case 
 the town had a new no parking rule over dirt 
 cars needed to be parked over an <unk> substance like <unk> or stone 
 <unk> reasons and social justice <unk> on the town council had passed this local law recently at the <unk> of the old fat <unk> 
 the code enforcement guy <unk> me after a couple of warnings 
 i had continued to park near my back door on the dirt 
 <unk> he had been in construction and was out of a job and friends with the fat <unk> <unk> 
 i post phoned the court date until after both <unk> <unk> removal and knee replacement had happened 
 appeared before the local <unk> <unk> 
 pleaded not guilty 
 the local <unk> tried the case pretty well
