 in that dorm laundry <unk> were on every other floor each having two washers and two dryers 
 i had dropped off a load of laundry at each of the washers and headed back down to my room for a bit 
 i came back as the load in washer 2 was just finishing up final spin cycle 
 washer 1 was washing someone else 's clothes 
 mine were in a pile on the floor 
 i move the clean clothes to the dryer and the floor clothes to washer 2 cursing out whoever did this 
 my clothes were soaking wet and still full of soap 
 about this time the revenge gods smiled on me 
 the building 's <unk> popped her head in and worried asked if i had clothing in washer 1. turns out it was out of order 
 after the wash cycle but before the first spin it would turn off 
 someone from <unk> was literally on their way over to fix it 
 considering that it was n't going to rinse out i decided to help the person who had dumped my clothing on the floor 
 i poured an extra three or four cups of detergent in the washer 
 i sat with my laundry putting the load from washer 2 in the dryer the original culprit nowhere to be found and headed back down to my room 
 i immediately told my <unk> the story and she decided this <unk> was n't enough 
 she decided to wash her sheets so that washer 2 would be taken up 
 sure enough she 's sitting there when the girl from the next floor up comes to check on her laundry 
 she 's shocked that her laundry is still wet and <unk> and bitches to my <unk> that someone probably stopped the machine 
 she tells my <unk> that earlier she had come in to find that someone had left their laundry sitting in the washer so she took their clothes out 
 my <unk> plays stupid acting like she did n't know whose laundry she dumped or that washer 1 was <unk> 
 so the bitch <unk> her machine and leaves again 
 as soon as she is gone my <unk> dumps another two cups of detergent in her washer for good measure 
 about this time <unk> shows up to repair the machine 
 he <unk> it but at first does n't take the laundry out 
 my <unk> is <unk> waiting for her loads of laundry to finish 
 upstairs bitch comes back down to the laundry room and asks what 's up with the washer 
 <unk> guy says he probably will have it fixed in a minute then run her load through that she does n't have to worry about it 
 she leaves 
 <unk> <unk> around a bit more then says to my <unk> that to make <unk> it turns out he 'll need to take the laundry out 
 he asks if she has something for him to put the wet laundry in 
 my <unk> being the helpful sort runs back to our room fills me in quickly and grabs a cardboard box 
 she pulls the soaking wet <unk> and <unk> with soap clothes from the washer and put them in the box for him 
 meanwhile i 've gone to a friend on the floor and i 'm telling her this whole story and she decides she wants to get involved 
 she grabs up a load of laundry 
 the second my <unk> 's load is done she dumps her laundry in 
 so upstairs bitch comes back down to the laundry room to find washer 1 <unk> washer 2 taken up by another person and her clothing all wet and gross in a box 
 thanks to the different people and the fact that university staff is there there 's no way she could suspect the conspiracy against her 
 she says she 's going to try to use another floor 's laundry and takes the box and leaves 
 five minutes later she 's down again 
 both washers upstairs were in use and people have more laundry <unk> up 
 during the trip up and down though the water and soap had started to <unk> through the box so by this point she 's handling this soggy mess barely containing her clothing 
 she <unk> it down orders my friend not to load anymore laundry when she was done with this load and leaves again 
 <unk> guy ends up putting an out of order sign on washer 1 and leaving 
 i do n't think he ever knew what was up 
 my friend <unk> her last load and is about to leave when another girl who we did n't even know and who honestly was just there to do laundry comes and puts her laundry in washer 2 taking the space from upstairs girl 
 by this point the sides on the wet cardboard box are <unk> from the weight of the laundry and no doubt her clothes would soon be on the floor right where she dumped mine 
 so that 's what happens when the stars <unk> friends pitch in and fate wants someone to have horrible horrible petty karma come their way 
 <unk> from /r/talesfromretail at the <unk> of <unk> not my story but a friend in high school 
 she was working at a <unk> shop in a town that had a university that tended to attract some rather ... '' unusual '' people and the shop she worked in was near the school 
 so she had a few good stories of <unk> patrons 
 one day a fellow came into the store and requested a single long stemmed red rose 
 she pulled one out of the display cooler sniffed it and handed it to him 
 the customer looked at it as if she 'd just given him a dog turd and handed it back saying no i want an <unk> one '' 
 she said she 'd have to get one from the <unk> cooler 
 she went in pulled out a rose sniffed it then took it out and sold it to him 
 they were both happy with the <unk> i was 19 i worked at a pizza <unk> delivering pizzas 
 one night i delivered a pizza to this guy who lived in an apartment complex 
 this apartment complex had a podium with little square buttons that you could press to <unk> each apartment 
 when i reached this guy 's apartment he started acting like a dick because i had held the button for too long and had upset his dog 
 i had held the button for maybe three seconds 
 i apologized because i still wanted that sweet sweet tip money 
 however he kept acting like a dick about it and made me give him exact change 
 so a few nights later i went back to his apartment building at 1am and taped down his <unk> button 
 i could hear him yelling who the fuck is it 
 stop ringing my <unk> '' over the intercom as i ran out the door to go back to my truck to drive <unk> live in a 4 <unk> apartment building and my neighbor right above me kept <unk> his cigarette butts down onto my front step 
 now he 's a chain smoker so it <unk> up really quickly 
 i kept just ignoring him and kept sweeping them off just going about my business since i do n't really like confrontation 
 but other friends and family started to notice and comment about it 
 which made it embarrassing for me and my wife 
 i finally built up the nerve and mentioned it to him and asked if he 'd mind not <unk> them down 
 he apologized and it stopped for about a week but it started again slowly and then it was all back 
 well i spoke to him again nothing 
 i spoke to my landlord nothing 
 finally i had enough 
 revenge - i got a grocery bag and painstakingly picked up every single stinking <unk> disgusting cigarette butt and put them in the bag 
 there were hundreds of them everywhere in my <unk> on the walkway and all around my car 
 i went out back where his personal entry door was and dumped them all on his step 
 it felt <unk> good 
 and surprisingly i never found another one on my step after that 
 tl dr - neighbor above me kept dropping his cigarette butts on my doorstep 
 so i emptied a bag full of his butts on his door step 
 i submitted pictures to <unk> about animals digging at my bedroom window about a month ago i couldnt figure out why animals were <unk> at my window 
 but it became nightly almost immediately after that post 
 well my crawlspace was locked by maintenance because homeless people were having sex in it 
 after they locked it up my roommates and i havent touched the room 
 though apparently maintenance gave the other duplex a key as well even though it isnt their crawlspace 
 what does the duplex do 
 stop paying for trash and put their garbage under my bedroom 
 today i found the mountain of garbage bags under my room after seeing the crawlspace door open and a fresh bag sitting inside 
 i waited until i knew they were done putting their garbage in my storage area 
 then i approached them and said hey guys what the fuck 
 i have complained about the animals fucking with me at night and you never said anything about putting your garbage under my room '' 
 the girl i was talking to goes yeah ... it smells really bad too ... and there are a lot of bugs ... '' well yeah -- now get it the fuck out 
 she tells me we dont have garbage cans so we have been missing garbage day and didnt want to put it on our porch because it all smells so bad '' 
 i said take all of mine i dont care we dont use them because we take our trash to the dump 
 this is not okay <unk> 
 i have animals messing with my windows this also explains our massive bug problem and likely <unk> '' 
 what does this fucking idiot do 
 put the cans in the crawlspace and lean more garbage against them 
 wow that is impressive 
 then after calling my landlord and chatting with him i removed all of their garbage bag by bag there was at least a months worth in there 
 i sat each bag down on their porch right outside of their door 
 some bags had gigantic <unk> from all of the animals <unk> every night under my bedroom 
 the bags that didnt 
 well ... i made big holes at the bottom the length of the bags so when you set it down they wont see that they have holes 
 then when they pick them up their fucking garbage goes everywhere 
 then i set the empty cans right next to all of the bags 
 fuck you asshole neighbors 
 **edit and update** : i keep getting an <unk> of update requests but i was at work and could n't immediately serve up 
 so i got to take pictures <unk> i got off work <unk> op has a life she has to go to during <unk> hours to afford <unk> at night 
 but here are the pictures i took upon arriving home there are pictures from inside and out of the crawlspace that show garbage still left behind that i did not want to even touch 
 there is also a picture to give context and proof that the crawlspace is indeed right underneath my bedroom 
 i was texting with my landlord this afternoon apparently he went over and talked to them which i think is why the garbage has been pushed into a corner of their porch 
 they still obviously have bags stacked but i assure you the ones in the trash can were probably a mess to get back together 
 he took away their key to the crawlspace and is apparently going to be <unk> to their <unk> because they 're all young and needed <unk> to the house 
 he is also buying poison and setting it out tonight for the <unk> that are in the area and it 's being sprayed for bugs sometime this week 
 im ashamed as op that i could not see them pick up their garbage but i still find joy in knowing that they probably had a field day picking up all of their <unk> shit off of their <unk> this year i had <unk> 5 <unk> <unk> <unk> my favorite <unk> 
 they were actually meant for the <unk> pile but a friend of mine <unk> them for me because they really were n't that bad off 
 after spending a couple of weeks in my house getting nice and healthy i decided it was time to <unk> them <unk> 
 i always wanted to <unk> flowers because it 's so <unk> <unk> and generic around here 
 now i live in a condo complex and i do n't know who has <unk> and who does n't so i started <unk> them in the <unk> tree footprints in the parking area well away from anyone 's windows or back door 
 in <unk> the bitchy lady that 's on the hoa board only because she took the job that no one else wants 
 bl : in a very loud voice <unk> ... .i hate to tell you but you ca n't do that '' 
 me : i have permission from lady who is also on the board '' 
 bl : still in a very loud voice well ... i 'm on the board too ... and i never heard of ... ... <unk> ... going through '' 
 me : i do n't know what to tell you 
 i 'll double check with other lady '' 
 now i would n't have been so petty with my revenge if this bitch did n't <unk> around the neighborhood wearing her hoa board id on a lanyard around her neck all the time and basically <unk> the community ... ... ... but i just got done <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all over the place by the cover of <unk> wearing all black i felt like <unk> hunt <unk> <unk> are about the size of <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> is n't really that much 
 it took me <unk> 
 45 minutes 
 all i had to do was rough up a patch of ground about 3 '' deep scatter <unk> <unk> then cover it back up and <unk> it down 
 i ca n't wait until the year after next to see all the beautiful <unk> i was at the grocery store and it was one of those moments where there was a rush of people so there were decently long lines at check out 
 i was in line and there was a woman in front of me 
 in front of her was a woman with a boy who was probably 5 or 6 and he was being a loud obnoxious kid 
 he was screaming at his mom about wanting a particular candy 
 she told him she was buying it for him and he could have it when they got home 
 he was demanding she give it to him now and throwing a full blown fit 
 she did nothing about it other than just laugh and smile at him like she approved 
 everyone in line was uncomfortable 
 as the line moved up the woman in front of me reached into that mom 's cart and grabbed that candy out of it 
 she put it in her own cart and waited 
 the mom never realized it was n't there so she paid and left 
 the woman in front of me looked at me and held up the candy <unk> and we both smiled enjoying the moment of thinking about how things were going to go down when they got home and realized that candy was not in their bags 
 *edit - changed a <unk> 'm french and my name 's <unk> 
 my company is owned by a british company and i often work with people from the british office 
 they have a <unk> to always spell my name the english way <unk> which annoys me 
 today i received a mail from <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> my name 
 so i replied to her and started my mail with hi <unk> '' that 'll teach her 
 <unk> wrote back btw and spelled my name properly this time i 'm sure she felt really guilty 
 my boyfriend 's <unk> uncle is squatting at my <unk> 's aunt 's downstairs again which is usually always stressful and annoying because he has no <unk> or sense of responsibility however over the summer he <unk> an abused pit from some <unk> <unk> 
 so now the dog is downstairs too 
 sweet loving doll of dog who uncle uses to brag about how he <unk> her so he 's a <unk> and she only <unk> to him and is loyal for being saved bla blah blah 
 now in addition to cleaning up after our own dog there 's double the <unk> in the backyard yet no help from him with pick up 
 she 's left for <unk> at the house so we let her out due to pity 
 it 's not her sweet fault he 's a jackass 
 on top of that we regularly hear him yelling at her when she barks and smacking her when she does n't listen 
 i 've made a routine out of going down to let her out feed her a treat take her on walks and enforce training even though he does n't use <unk> 
 last night i went down to chit chat with the family 
 she <unk> me at the door as she does anyone excited and bouncy and too big for the small kitchen 
 he comes in yelling and <unk> her on the ass 
 she <unk> to it as an <unk> does a fly landing on it 's back so he keeps at it 
 over the <unk> i calmly but <unk> say baby 
 <unk> '' 
 she stops glances over and promptly approaches completely oblivious of her owner and sits down at me feet completely <unk> for her next command 
 it was very very hard to keep the delicious victory from showing on my face 
 we did n't mean for this to happen but we 're so glad it did 
 i was <unk> during november of my freshman year of high school 
 i had been grounded a few days before by my mother so i was surprised when she gave me the phone after i got off the bus 
 <unk> call <unk> 
 <unk> i thought i was grounded ... <unk> call <unk> 
 my best friend <unk> and i went to different high schools so she would get home before me which is why i missed her call 
 i called her and she was crying 
 she told me her parents were getting divorced 
 she had been talking about how for the last few weeks the piano <unk> from their church had been coming by a lot lately to tune their piano '' but <unk> had caught his hand on her mom 's leg once while they were talking at the table 
 <unk> 's dad found out she had been cheating and asked for a divorce 
 luckily it was a friday so i asked my mom if i could sleep over there 
 her mother was moving out the next morning and piano <unk> was going to be helping her 
 <unk> wanted to stay at her house while they moved out because her dad would be out on business and she wanted to be sure her mom and piano <unk> did n't take anything that was n't their 's 
 i figured she needed all the help and support she could get 
 whenever we had <unk> we would <unk> a cake <unk> <unk> or whatever we had on hand 
 we woke up early and decided to make <unk> <unk> muffins for breakfast 
 we were <unk> our second batch when one of <unk> 's dogs <unk> up and <unk> two muffins 
 we did n't want him getting sick and he knew how to get in the trash if he wanted to so we put the two muffins on a separate plate so we would know which ones had been <unk> on 
 this entire time piano <unk> and <unk> 's mom were walking through the house to bring her stuff to the car 
 we went back to distracting ourselves from them 
 then both of us saw in our peripheral vision piano <unk> <unk> a <unk> and walking away <unk> 
 after he left the house we checked and it was a <unk> <unk> that he took 
 we were in a fit of giggles 
 we poured the rest of the batch into the <unk> <unk> and we tried not to laugh as he took another on his way back in 
 we checked again and he took the other <unk> <unk> 
 at that point we could n't stop laughing 
 as he was leaving he had the audacity to ask us why we were laughing 
 we said it was nothing and put more muffins in the oven 
 since then <unk> 's mom married piano <unk> but she wants to leave him now too 
 for the past nine years <unk> <unk> muffins has been an inside joke of <unk> story happened a couple <unk> ago but it still gives me the warm and <unk> when i think about it 
 when i was growing up i got sick a lot 
 constant <unk> several <unk> a year of vomiting for days got a cold every time it was going around etc 
 after a few years of this i grew to learn and recognize the feelings that <unk> getting sick or how to tell if a certain <unk> would make me feel better or worse 
 when i was in elementary school i was home feeling sick 
 my mom was irritated she did n't want to deal with me <unk> around and whining <unk> 
 i was feeling <unk> and *really* did n't want to throw up 
 she kept telling me to take some <unk> <unk> since it would make me feel better 
 being someone who had taken a lot of it in the past i could <unk> imagine the taste and <unk> of both the liquid and the <unk> and i <unk> it would make me <unk> 
 she kept insisting i kept refusing 
 eventually she decided to force her hand 
 i do n't think she poured any down my <unk> but i think she yelled and intimidated my small self into taking some and <unk> over me to make sure i finished all of it 
 now something i have n't mentioned is that just a few days earlier she had paid to have all of our white carpets in the house professionally cleaned 
 this was a fairly big <unk> and took some time and money 
 almost right away after being forced to <unk> <unk> <unk> i knew 
 <unk> was going to happen 
 * i ran 
 i honestly tried to make it to the bathroom or at least to a trash can along the way 
 instead i only made it as far as the hallway right outside of my mom 's bedroom door 
 hot pink vomit poured out of me all over the <unk> cleaned white carpet 
 hot pink vomit right outside her bedroom 
 you know that feeling right after you throw up where for a brief moment all you feel is that fantastic <unk> of absolute relief 
 i experienced that times ten for it was <unk> on top of the sweet feeling of <unk> of knowing that i was <unk> 
 * i <unk> her it would make me throw up but did she listen 
 try getting that out of your <unk> onto your butts <unk> 
 this is gon na be a long ride 
 so i was working one of those big bike stores 
 you know with tons of bike stuff and a full service counter 
 i was an <unk> and a <unk> mechanic at times i was never good as the two older guys who worked there 
 well it was <unk> the end of the day and the two older guys had left a bit early because they had finished all the big projects that day 
 i was left with some easy stuff wheel changes trip computer installation and a few final <unk> to have out on the floor 
 a guy comes in <unk> 
 and asks how much it would be to put on a seat and a <unk> on his bike 
 we of course had our prices on a giant board but most people do n't look anyways so i told him it would be around $ 20 
 he did n't seem very happy but said that was ok. he says he will go get the bike out of his car 
 what he brought in was a bike in a box 
 as in completely <unk> 
 me sir this bike is in a box ... '' old cranky bastard <unk> and '' 
 me <unk> this is more than putting a seat and handlebars on a bike ... '' <unk> well the wheels but i was expecting you to do that for free '' just the wheels would be a $ 5 service charge in itself ... me well sir as you can see on our price board a full <unk> is $ 120 ... '' <unk> what 
 that is not the price you <unk> me '' 
 what is this an insurance company 
 me sir you told be it was just a seat and a <unk> 
 for a full <unk> we have to connect everything make sure it all is in working order and perform our safety check '' <unk> i do n't want any of that shit 
 just put it fucking together '' 
 me i am sorry but i will have to charge you $ 120 for that 
 i ca n't bend the rules with the <unk> checks '' <unk> where is your manager '' 
 me he is at the front desk '' now this manager was a nice guy not really a pushover or anything but would tend to side with the customers on most things 
 he was pretty good at finding a <unk> however 
 a few <unk> later the manager walks back and says why are you trying to charge 120 for a seat and handlebars '' 
 it 's important to note that he sounded more confused as to why i was doing this than angry 
 i just pointed to the bike 
 in an old <unk> box 
 manager walks right back to the customer who had stayed in the front 
 i do n't go up there because i do n't want to deal with this guy 
 after a few minuets of yelling and <unk> manager and the guy comes back 
 manager says to <unk> <unk> bike and we will give him a $ 20 discount to make the price 100. now i am not really happy that we had to <unk> to this guy but i do n't sign the checks 
 does n't really matter too much to me how much we make off of him 
 he still looks pissed however 
 so i get to work on this ancient <unk> bike 
 i am super happy the screws and everything were in a little bag because they were all older types we do n't really carry this is important 
 anyways after working on this bike for around 40 minuets the guy storms back in and asks if we are finished yet 
 of course we are n't 
 he then starts screaming at us to take it all apart he found a different store that would do it all for 15 dollars 
 then comes screaming <unk> of ripping him off telling us that we are just wage <unk> he actually said that haha 
 my manager is pissed at this point and just wants him out 
 so he tells me to rip it apart and shoves it back in the box 
 which is exactly what i did 
 i took this thing apart in the most <unk> way possible shoving everything into the box 
 they guy had gone back out to his car to wait on us to take it apart 
 i was pissed at this dude for wasting my time 
 manager was pissed for the lost time and money 
 other employee was pissed because they guy was an <unk> 
 so every fifth screw i took off disappeared into the garbage 
 whoops 
 looks like he will have to pay extra for specialty screws 
 i started to feel a little bad about it 
 until i took the box out to his car 
 he told me i would n't amount to much and i just just serve <unk> or something 
 he 
 actually 
 told 
 me 
 that 
 the icing on the cake was a phone call we got e next day from said other store 
 apparently he was saying that we would do it for less than them and they were flabbergasted 
 guess what he had told them 
 that he had just wanted a seat and handlebars put on 
 tl dr : we find the <unk> world of <unk> in the back room 
 mr. <unk> gets shot with a <unk> gun 
 edited because words be hard <unk> used to work with a very passive aggressive woman who was the poster child for <unk> bad dressing and <unk> 
 part of her job was to sit at my desk and answer the phone while i went to lunch 
 this also meant that she had to go downstairs and get the mail from the mail room if it was ready for pickup 
 i came back from lunch and got an angry call from the mail room 
 she never got the mail 
 i asked her why and she lied that her arm '' hurt and she could n't get the mail 
 her arm was fine 
 she was just lazy - another one of her <unk> 
 a few minutes later she said to me can you let me know when that lunch meeting is over 
 i want to grab a sandwich '' 
 i never told her when it was over in fact i told many other people so that there would be nothing left for her 
 when she realized she had missed out she asked me why did n't you call me '' 
 sorry my arm hurt 
 i could n't pick up the phone '' 
 i <unk> visiting family over the holidays little sister decided to hide my stuff in an attempt to be funny '' and <unk> the old days '' when we were younger 
 she knows it annoys the living hell out of me but did it anyways 
 i spent a good hour looking for half of my charger 
 she hid the cable part then i found one of my shoes in the dishwasher 
 i calmly asked her to stop and give me my stuff back she did give it back but did n't stop 
 slowly more of my items went missing and i went to reclaim them every time and today i got my revenge 
 i got all the toilet paper in the house and put it in one bathroom while she was sleeping 
 we had spicy food last night which gives her the runs and my plan was set in motion 
 i greeted her and made my way to the bathroom she has been standing outside of the bathroom for 10 minutes and as i type this i sit in my toilet paper <unk> enjoying the revenge in motion 
 update : after 45 minutes of me sitting in here she drove off to the nearest gas station to go <unk> 
 i believe i <unk> about a year ago they <unk> one of my neighbors property 's and problems ensued 
 so where i live there were three now four houses sharing the same driveway with a fence on both sides so there is nowhere else to go 
 now the guy who was building the house came over to my place on day one and explained that here 's my number to call and i will be here the whole time except for my two week vacation in a month 
 well to build a house it requires a lot of <unk> of <unk> and various things 
 generally the days that they did this they would go to all of the neighbors houses early in the morning to give them some time to move their car out onto the street so they were n't blocked in 
 a month later while the guy who i have the contact details for is on vacation i drive down the driveway turn the corner it 's an l shape and find a <unk> massive gravel truck there just pulled up 
 now there 's space for the truck to move off the driveway but he looked new and probably did n't understand the situation 
 so i get out of my car as he gets out of his cab walk up to him and politely ask him if he can move the truck off the driveway so we can get access 
 he just looks at me and goes fuck off kid real men doing work here 
 i ai n't <unk> '' 
 i say it again being serious this time and say that i have somewhere to be and that they are n't following the access policy which all the houses signed 
 i get told to fuck off yet again and then the guy starts to try to threaten me 
 so i walk away and think how will i get to meet up with my friends ... 
 for movie marathon awesome btw 
 so a few texts later my friends pull into my driveway as <unk> by me and park directly behind his truck blocking him in 
 he had no way out 
 my friends jump out lock their cars and walk towards my place 
 guy comes out shouting you ca n't park there this is an active construction site 
 this is illegal i will call the cops '' 
 i walk up to him say that since this is now a parking lot according to you i will park here as i have the right to use it 
 and to top it off i inform him that what he is doing is illegal and i 'm not as i own the land that we 're standing on 
 one and a half hours later when we need to go get more supplies we find him in his cab fuming to the site manager on holiday and being told that he 's in the wrong 
 we go somewhere in our cars come back and of course he 's gone 
 when the site manager gets back he comes with the truck driver and they both apologize to me 
 even gave me a half dozen beers as a apology gift 
 best 
 feeling 
 ever 
 <unk> <unk> guy blocked my driveway i blocked him in as <unk> he had to apologize to me and give me beer 
 so this happened to me yesterday on my way home from school 
 we were in a two lane road with a lot of traffic and i was with my family in the car 
 we needed to merge onto the right lane so we turned on the turn signal etc 
 and tried to merge 
 at the last second some bitch talking on an iphone cut us off and yelled fuck you '' out the window 
 we ended up merging right behind her 
 lo and behold her car failed right at that spot dead battery no ignition etc 
 now revenge time 
 as we pulled out from behind them i told the entire family to smile and wave boys 
 she absolutely lost her shit and started punching the <unk> wheel 
 it was absolutely wonderful tl dr be rude i will kill you with <unk> a bit of backstory 
 basically i was dating this girl last year 
 we ended up being together for a few months then it all ended with her having sex with my <unk> during my birthday party 
 got <unk> was depressed for a few months got better and managed to move on 
 i 'm with a wonderful girl now and life is just great 
 let 's move on to the main story 
 today i was chilling at my friends house 
 we we 're eating some pizza chilling out and just enjoying some <unk> <unk> it was getting pretty late and i did n't really feel like walking home since it 's a bit of a distance 
 <unk> <unk> too be <unk> here 's where my <unk> comes in 
 we have a few mutual friends so some times we end up meeting 
 this time she called my friend to ask him if he had an android charger she could borrow as she did n't have the money to buy a new one right now and hers was broken 
 he said he did n't have any left for her to borrow at this exact moment while at the same time he turned his head and looked at me with a <unk> smile on his face 
 he slowly said but i do think <unk> has one you could borrow '' 
 i looked at my friend with a <unk> face while he just nodded and took his hand up and gave me a thumb 's up 
 i do n't quite know is he home '' 
 she said with a voice so full of disgust i could feel it from the other side of the room 
 no he is n't 
 but if you could swing by my house and pick him up and drive him home i 'm sure he 'll borrow you one '' 
 she let out a big <unk> '' while she slowly muttered fine i 'll stop by and pick him up but he better be ready '' 
 she hung up the phone and i got dressed 
 my friend and i laughed it off thinking i would get a easy ride home in change for my old charger 
 but i did n't have any intention of giving her my old charger 
 she came and picked me up and the drive to my house was one the the most silent and most uncomfortable drives in my life 
 we finally arrived and i said i would be fast 
 i walked slowly taking very good time to reach the door checked all the pockets for my key 
 probably used around 2-3 minutes just looking for my key in my pockets until i finally found it 
 i then unlocked the door did some <unk> checked reddit and facebook 
 after 5 minutes i walked out of my door and saw she was still standing there 
 she rolled down her window asking if i had found it or not 
 no i have n't 
 but i 'll search some more 
 just hold on for 2 more minutes i promise i 'll find it '' 
 i walked inside sat my ass down on the sofa and turned on the tv 
 then i used around 10 minutes just watching tv till i finally walked outside 
 have you found the charger yet 
 i 'm in a bit of a hurry '' 
 this time i leaned backwards towards the door and just stood the with my back against it 
 i looked upwards towards the sky while i slowly muttered i wonder ... i wonder ... where can it be 
 i used it this morning '' 
 you know what 
 i 'll go look one more time 
 i think i know where it is now 
 just hold on tight '' 
 she let out another big <unk> while she <unk> down in her seat 
 i went inside and started looking only this time i used 15 minutes playing games on my phone 
 i then walked back out walked to her car and said you know what i think i 've lost it some place 
 i 'm really sorry 
 i think i forgot it at my friend 's house so you could drive over there and check '' 
 she slammed her door shut and drove away 
 i 've never seen her so mad 
 the best thing was when i walked inside took out my phone and plugged my charger into it 
 <unk> <unk> what a pleasure 
 **tl dr : ** <unk> a free ride home and still manage to <unk> my <unk> 
 oh good <unk> yes 
 <unk> at the store with my wife a while back picking up stuff to throw on the grill an opportunity presented itself that i just could n't pass up 
 the store was not terribly crowded and only one lane was open to check out 
 while we were walking up to stand in line a woman came from behind us at a near jog with a cart overflowing with stuff and of course cut right in front of us before we could get in line 
 i get it fair is fair and we were n't in line yet but it was still a jerk move i mean we only had a dozen or so items 
 but rather than make a big deal of it i had a better idea 
 i turned to my wife and in a voice loud enough for ms. <unk> to hear said figures we get all the way down here and they open the first lane up 
 no one even in line '' 
 ms. <unk> hears this and without looking takes off to the newly opened lane 
 i calmly push my cart up and <unk> to myself 
 less than a minute later ms. <unk> comes back giving me the <unk> look i have seen since i farted in the car on a family road trip while it was raining 
 i put on a straight face looked at my wife and said hmm guess it was n't open after all 
 i work a 12 hour a day 7 days on 7 days off job 
 every 3rd on week i work nights 
 at nights and on weekends there are no more than 15 people in our 11 story building 
 the parking garage and our office building have a drive that passes between them 
 the closest parking spots are 8 building management spots that are full monday though friday 8 - 5 but night and weekends they are empty 
 i parked in one of those spots and carried lunch at midnight on a saturday in for my co-worker and i. the went out a couple hours later to get something out of my car and find a warning ticket that said a notice had been sent to my supervisor and his boss and i would have to pay a fine if it happened again 
 <unk> revenge** i knew the security guard always parked his car in the drive between the office building and the parking garage in a posted <unk> parking fire <unk> area 
 i called the cops and told them that they were parked in a fire zone and had been all weekend 
 within an hour i watched from my window as a cop was outside writing him a ticket 
 **edit** i have always subscribed to the theory that you catch more flies with honey than you can with <unk> and have always asked the guard if i could pick him up something to eat when i go out to get food i usually bring my lunch since it is hard to find something other than fast food at midnight 
 i have always declined his money when i brought him something and this night he had said no he did n't need anything 
 i have not even asked him since this incident 
 hi <unk> here 
 i am <unk> petty nor vengeful but i have a couple coworkers who 've inspired me to go the extra <unk> feet to mess with 
 i work as a cook at a restaurant 
 five days a week i show up as scheduled at 7 am 
 this is not the case for any of my coworkers 
 to a person the opening staff will trickle in <unk> minutes late usually hung over if not still a wee bit drunk 
 every morning i have to do these <unk> jobs until they show up 
 without fail these <unk> bags of <unk> show up pour a cup of coffee and hope it 'll help them function which it usually does after a several 
 since i 'm there first i make the coffee and i tend to make it strong for them because i <unk> to be a nice guy 
 until today 
 because i show up well rested fed and ready i do n't give two fucks about <unk> 
 so today i made a nice batch of decaf instead 
 it was glorious 
 the <unk> would n't go away 
 <unk> functions remained <unk> 
 they all simultaneously had shitty days 
 one guy <unk> to leave early 
 it was everything i could do to not laugh out loud 
 seriously i do n't hate these guys but if even one of them thought today sucked maybe i should n't drink so much tonight '' then it was worth it 
 fucking <unk> light of getting pulled over as a passenger in a cab by power <unk> cops i thought i 'd share my petty revenge story from a few years back 
 i was still an <unk> student at the time 19 years of age 
 it was summer and i was having me one of those summer <unk> 
 i attended church every sunday back then and so was this girl i was <unk> with 
 my church has a basketball court so i 'd always have an extra set of clothes with me on sunday to change into after sweaty games of ball underwear and all 
 we usually finished playing ball at around 7 or 8 when it gets dark out here during summer 
 on this particular sunday we ended at eight and the sky was slowly <unk> toward night 
 of course the girl stayed to watch me play and we hung out after 
 being young and unable to keep it in my pants we eventually ended up <unk> around and ended up in the bathroom of the church at this time there 's no one there 
 we get to <unk> around and i have to <unk> so she asks where am i going to come 
 knowing that i have an extra pair of <unk> <unk> i calmly state do n't worry i 'll just come into my underwear '' 
 so i come in my underwear put on a new set of clothes threw my come filled underwear into my bag and we headed out 
 our church is on the side of a hill and at the top in one of my friend 's neighborhood there is a beautiful view <unk> the city 
 i thought it 'd be romantic so i drove us to the spot 
 we chill in my car but hormones get the best of me and we 're having a hot and <unk> make out session 
 my car begins <unk> up on the inside to the point where i could draw stuff on my windows and i could n't even see outside 
 suddenly bright lights flash in from behind my car 
 oh shit 
 cops '' 
 i thought 
 i quickly <unk> down my window so i can see what it is behind me through my side view mirror 
 i see someone walking up slowly 
 my heart begins to race 
 i hear a knock on the window and i open my door and get out 
 i take a quick glance at their vehicle neighborhood security <unk> car 
 <unk> '' 
 i thought 
 they asked what we were doing and i just said kissing '' 
 they took my driver 's license and plate numbers gave me a warning and told me to leave 
 i happily obliged 
 i hastily <unk> down the <unk> on my side of windshield and my female friend and i <unk> off 
 i drove maybe 100 feet before i noticed the <unk> blue and red glow of police lights in my rear view mirror 
 fuckin fuck '' 
 i thought as i got pulled over by the actual police this time 
 i roll my windows down placed my hands on the <unk> wheel and tried to be as mild <unk> as possible 
 the cop comes up with his <unk> shining in my face i see his partner behind him with his gun drawn 
 why is it so <unk> in here '' 
 he questioned 
 i do n't know sir '' i replied 
 are you guys doing drugs '' 
 he asked 
 no sir '' i replied 
 get out of the vehicle '' 
 the officer demanded as his partner now <unk> his gun and began to walk towards the passenger side where my female friend was sitting 
 she seems clearly flustered and <unk> but knowing i did n't have anything that could <unk> me i was slightly calmer 
 they walked us to the curb <unk> still pointed directly into my eyes 
 put your hands behind your back '' the officer <unk> as he <unk> us and sat us on the curb 
 at this point i 'm getting extremely agitated as i feel this is clearly unnecessary and that these guys are just power <unk> 
 i mean the guy had his gun out before his partner even talked to me really 
 so the officer asks can i search your vehicle '' 
 knowing my right to refuse a search and knowing that i had nothing <unk> i sheepishly replied yes '' 
 now i 'm intently watching the officer as he <unk> through my car and lo and behold he gets to my bag 
 i watch with eager <unk> as he begins to open it 
 he shoves his hand inside and takes out the first thing his hand <unk> my come filled underwear 
 i see him feel my come on his hands and confused as to what it is i watch him as he sniffs my come 
 his face is <unk> instantly with disgust as he just gently puts my bag and underwear back into my car 
 he wipes his hand on his uniform and he and his partner speak for 30 seconds before taking off the handcuffs and letting us go with a warning 
 tl dr : <unk> made a power <unk> cop touch feel and smell my <unk> in the supermarket browsing through the magazines waiting for my girlfriend who was in the restroom when a group of four teenage girls walked past 
 they were your typical look at me '' girls you know <unk> in a thick <unk> of fake tan with bright bottle <unk> hair and wearing <unk> the size of a tea bags 
 just as they passed by me one of them pushed her friend into me causing me to stumble 
 i turned round and told them to be more careful when the leader of the gang said to her friends amusement fuck off you fat <unk> '' i let this go as it 's not worth the bother and walked away only to hear them laughing saying that 's right walk away fat boy '' i really wanted to kill the little fuckers but thought it 's best to leave it 
 after meeting my girlfriend a few moments later i told her about these girls and how angry i was 
 do you mean those girls over there 
 she asked pointing in the group now hanging around the jewelry section 
 yeah that 's them 
 well you should inform security on what they did 
 better still tell security that you seen them put things under their clothes 
 well bugger me my girlfriend is a evil genius 
 so that 's what we did went up to one of the guards and lied our <unk> off about these girls putting things like earrings and rings down their bra 's 
 we hung about for a few moments to see the girls be surrounded by security and other staff members and be taken through the stores staff only doors 
 at this point we made a bee line out of there so not to be asked any questions by staff 
 we hung about a short distance from the store to see if the police would show up and not 5 mins later two officers drove into the car park and made their way into the store 
 i 'm not 100 % sure if they did get stripped <unk> or not but i would like to think they did 
 at least it would have put the end of their fun for the night 
 and yeah looking back i know it was wrong given it was a <unk> of police time 
 but honestly it felt so fucking good 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edit : some people have <unk> about how i was wrong to do this to 14 year old girls or there about no where in my post did i mention their ages i simply said teenagers 
 for the record the girls '' were at least <unk> years old possibly older 
 some might even consider them adults 
 and as for the folks saying i should have just walked away 
 be honest with yourself if someone publicly <unk> you a <unk> would your first reaction be to walk away or might you just be angry enough to do something stupid like i did in the heat of the moment 
 no 
 well i <unk> you 
 it must be so nice up there on that high <unk> 
 good view huh 
 for the past 7 years i have worked for the same company 
 without getting overly specific i market our material to <unk> manage our media do some <unk> <unk> and do <unk> design work 
 we are a small company and i am the resident tech person so i am a jack of all <unk> 
 over the years i have grown to dislike the people that i work with <unk> 
 they have : stolen my food i am <unk> <unk> so i make the effort to make my own food ... and people go through my lunch and eat it anyway stolen my <unk> they are completely inconsiderate with my time they are condescending and i am routinely taken for granted 
 i have gotten verbally <unk> more times than i can count and i am severely <unk> 
 i ca n't even use them as a reference for future jobs because i simply ca n't trust them - the person that had my position before me used my boss as a reference and my boss agreed to give him a good <unk> and i heard my boss <unk> my <unk> to a potential <unk> over the phone 
 super classy 
 i am <unk> this terrible job to go back to school 
 when they hired my replacement they got someone as cheaply as they could and the person they chose did n't have any background in any kind of <unk> <unk> 
 they think so little of my job that they did n't think my replacement needed any experience whatsoever 
 anyway training this new guy has been an absolute <unk> 
 in 5 days he 's nearly destroyed our website and he sent <unk> media to a sales rep and made a fool of her in a large meeting 
 at this point i assumed that i 'd train my replacement and say goodbye to this company for good with <unk> drama - they selected someone without a proper background they can deal with it 
 last week had been busy since we have clients in and i brought my personal computer in to help with the load since my replacement has been on my company computer to <unk> the ropes 
 i have brought my personal computer in before when we have been in a squeeze and i have been compensated $ 10 a day nothing crazy 
 i brought up <unk> this time around and my boss gets in my face and says i did n't realize your computer came with a fee 
 i thought you had been sharing the company computer with your replacement '' 
 i had obviously not been sharing my company computer with my replacement since we had been working in entirely different offices 
 my boss had even requested that i set up multiple <unk> on my personal computer during this time 
 he was playing dumb and lying to my face 
 i did n't say anything because i knew whatever came out of my mouth at that moment would n't be <unk> 
 however i did think you have made a huge mistake '' 
 i did n't bring my computer into work the next week and the entire workload was shifted to my replacement 
 i was working in the respect that i was going over things that my replacement did n't understand which was a lot lol but i was n't able to work <unk> since my replacement and myself were sharing one machine 
 at one point my boss asked me why a project that he gave me was n't done and i said well since i am sharing a computer with my replacement and he 's been really busy with the clients i have n't had a chance to get to it '' 
 my boss looked unhappy but was unable to admit his mistake - and by the time he realized the extent of his mistake it was too late 
 since i was n't there to shoulder the workload the <unk> replacement <unk> the entire company looked incompetent and we lost future jobs with the clients there were two clients which <unk> to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost that we had in our office 
 i watched the world burn 
 this past week was my last week and this was a sweet way to go out 
 tldr : i bring in my personal computer to help make a busy week more <unk> my boss refused to offer the most <unk> of <unk> so i do n't bring my computer in anymore and watch all hell break loose 
 edit : for clarity and more <unk> 'm a <unk> master 
 <unk> 
 in my group of friends the <unk> is responsible for the game itself and picking dinner 
 i fucking love <unk> and i cook it like i 'm some variety of boss so one game weekend i cooked up a big ass <unk> 
 of course everyone <unk> in with money or a side that 's how the world works 
 the house we play at is owned by the brother of a friend <unk> and he has a wife who i will <unk> as dc 
 figure for yourself what dc is it 's a choose your own adventure game with insults 
 the <unk> had just come out of the over it was <unk> and it smelled and looked beautiful the garlic bread is going in the oven and there chips and dip out everyone has their beer and their smoke except me 
 i 'm responsible for an entire fantasy world i like to keep my wits about me 
 it also helps me catch them doing stupid shit so i can cleverly <unk> them or reward them if they <unk> a <unk> but i digress 
 we 're out on the patio and dc is sitting just inside the back door on the couch 
 i was talking shop with the guys and somehow we were talking about how one of the hydraulic lift tables we use to transport <unk> has a shitty wheel that gets jammed and makes subtle <unk> difficult 
 dc : why do n't you just fix it instead of crying about it 
 i can ignore her which she fucking hates i can say i dunno how and appear incompetent which is n't really true anyways or i can say the first thing that comes to my head which she ended up fucking <unk> 
 me : do you know how to repair every piece of equipment you use on the job 
 dc : if you 're gon na take that attitude with me then you can just leave 
 i 've heard stories 
 this was n't a warning this was her telling me to leave 
 now 
 i already know the score but i 'm the <unk> the game does n't happen without me and i brought the <unk> dish so if i go it goes and these guys get stuck with garlic bread and chips and no game 
 me : look dc sorry i snapped that was rude of ... dc : i said get out 
 <unk> have been pulled i am clear for <unk> 
 me : fine but if i leave all these people here have no game i can hold this game elsewhere and it 's not like i do n't have anywhere else to go but if i leave you 'd be ruining the night for everyone 
 dc : not my problem <unk> can i speak to you upstairs 
 so i go collect my shit my campaign <unk> my books my dice and i walk them out to my car 
 i come back in the house as she 's walking back down stairs 
 dc : i thought i told you ... i cut her off she hates that too 
 her alpha shit holds no power over me 
 me : yeah yeah i 'm getting the rest of my shit 
 dc : well hurry up i wan na eat and i 'm not doing it with *you* here 
 i laugh 
 i <unk> laughing 
 i had to stop moving because i was laughing so hard 
 you see she did n't know 
 she knew what was for dinner but she had no idea whose dish it was who prepared it anything 
 she had come downstairs after it was in the oven 
 i grab the <unk> and she asks what i thought i was doing 
 with a big grin on my face i say ... it 's my dish i prepared it name of other friend and his father are going back to his place to eat it '' dc : well cut me out a piece before you go '' 
 i laugh all the way out the door 
 edit : thanks for the comments and i 'm glad you all enjoyed the story 
 i 'll throw you all a bone the d stands for <unk> there are no bad <unk> here except perhaps the parents of the child but revenge was <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> 
 i was a witness only 
 i was in a petting zoo area in a large <unk> zoo 
 very noticeable was a little girl in a white dress and white <unk> hat 
 she was <unk> the stuffing out of all the animals 
 she wasn’t trying to be mean 
 she was just too young to appreciate that it was not pleasant to be a small animal and have your neck squeezed like it was a <unk> tube on its last day 
 this went on for a while 
 i saw a young deer <unk> behind a pole and watching her 
 i wish i had had the <unk> to talk with her and try to <unk> her enthusiastic <unk> 
 as i was walking about i heard a sound like something blown through a pipe 
 i sensed something pass nearby me 
 then i heard the crying 
 looking around it appears that a <unk> who had been hugged shot a load of spit an amazing distance and hit the girl square in the head 
 she had <unk> on her hat and dress 
 a sad tale with no real bad guy but from that <unk> perspective <unk> served up petty <unk> little brothers dad <unk> used to <unk> bully me when i was in middle school and this is a large part of why my mom is no longer with him 
 i absolutely <unk> him 
 i 've never been an angry person but there 's just something about him that brings out this rage inside of me 
 out of respect for my little brother i do n't speak about his dad whatsoever to him 
 all i have to say is negative so there 's no reason to say anything 
 his dad needs people to like him to acknowledge his presence 
 it drives him insane if you 're not listening to what he has to say or if he 's not in charge 
 so i 've just started ignoring him anytime i see him 
 when he drops my little brother off and says hello <unk> how are you doing '' i 'll either continue on what i 'm building in the garage and not acknowledge him or look up and then look back down at what i was doing 
 i 've been doing it for a few months now and he 's been changing his tone and asking more questions to try and get me to reply 
 but seeing it get at him makes it that much more <unk> was nice and used to place a salt <unk> in the community kitchen since salt is cheap and i liked to have some around 
 one co-worker abused the privilege however 
 she used the salt every day and one month i had to replace it out twice 
 who uses that much salt 
 anyway one day co-worker comes waltzing into my office and says hey <unk> i used the last of the salt 
 be sure to pick some up the next time you are at the store okay '' 
 i did buy salt that weekend but informed my co-workers i was done <unk> salt for everyone and kept it in my desk drawer 
 a few months ago <unk> co-worker caught on that i still had salt 
 my salt supply started <unk> rapidly 
 one day she forgot to put the salt back and i found it on her desk 
 when i confronted her about it she joked i was being stupid and that it was only salt 
 when i went to my manager about it he told me to quit wasting his time over salt 
 fine 
 i switched out the salt in my <unk> with sugar 
 now i keep the real salt in my purse which has a lock on it 
 my co-worker has been shooting me glares for weeks 
 buy your own salt <unk> any formatting issues mobile user here so i work as a cashier at a <unk> entertainment center 
 it has <unk> <unk> an arcade ... the works 
 so these two girls come in looking to be around <unk> and they want to go on the <unk> 
 alright cool 
 but it 's not cool when you start talking about how my co-worker is a massive slut because she 's dating a guy you have a crush on 
 she told me this later i just figured there was something going on so they decide to do two races each which comes down to 17 dollars <unk> 
 turns out they had 36 dollars between the two of them but they wanted to get drinks 
 because of their <unk> i did n't tell them about our deal in which they get two races for fifteen dollars 
 the best part was when they started arguing because one girl had more money than the other and she wanted her to pay her back later but the girl with less money said the rich girl should just pay without <unk> because we 're friends '' tl : dr : i start a <unk> over 4 <unk> school <unk> of 5 years planned on getting married decided she had n't been with enough guys but wanted to keep me on a string when she was done <unk> her <unk> 
 she did the same thing 
 broke up but wanted to stay in contact with me to keep that door open 
 i had to tell her straight up you did n't want me so leave me alone '' 
 i eventually moved out of my apartment and changed phone numbers 
 did n't give her any info and that was that 
 i was finally rid of her 
 until years later i was still not married she had just gotten married and found out a close member of my family died 
 she contacted my mom and she gave her my address 
 boy i was furious with old mom 
 anyway she wrote me a letter and in it said she wished things had turned out differently with us 
 first of all i was pissed that she would use my <unk> as an excuse to contact me out of the blue 
 secondly i was pissed that she was n't <unk> her husband by writing me a letter telling me that crap 
 so i put the letter in a new envelope addressed to her husband 
 in it i attached a post-it with the message tell your wife to leave me alone '' 
 i never heard from her again 
 problem <unk> graduated college about a month ago 
 this story takes place after the <unk> ceremony 
 after the event ended my parents wanted to go outside and take a picture with me in my cap and <unk> and all that fantastic stuff 
 while my sister starts to take a picture of me and my parents a family walks in the shot completely <unk> the space behind my sister they could use to get by 
 <unk> worse instead of continuing to walk to get out of the picture they just stopped there and start talking right in front of the camera where my <unk> obviously trying to take our picture 
 ok i think maybe they’re just really oblivious to their surroundings 
 we move over a little so the group is out of the frame 
 my sister tries to retake the picture but then an asshat man that was a part of that family started backing up into our frame while pulling his daughter in to a <unk> 
 i make eye contact and he smiles 
 he doesn’t give a shit he sees the camera and knows <unk> been trying to take a picture 
 he’s just an asshole who doesn’t care 
 eventually after moving very far away from the asshats we’re able to get a few quick decent pictures 
 while leaving the site my step father notices the same family who delayed our pictures is now trying to <unk> for their own graduation photos 
 i think you know where this is going 
 my step dad approaches them and waits until they are about to take the picture 
 he then proceeds to walk very slowly in between the family and the photographer while <unk> very loudly <unk> look 
 it’s our turn to ruin their photos ” the rest of us were in tears for about 5 minutes after 
 i love my <unk> 
 edited : for <unk> wife complained very early in our marriage you left the seat up '' 
 i grew up with a brother and no sisters - the seat was rarely down 
 anyway from that day forward i make a conscious effort to put the lid and seat down 
 my wonderful wife has had to lift the lid every time for <unk> years 
 essentially the same effort she would have to put the seat down herself 
 <unk> it 's much cleaner anyway ... i was driving home the other day after a long days work when i enter a school zone 
 i slow down because occasionally there is a cop hiding in the parking lot of the park 
 i 'm going 25 <unk> when this douchebag in a shiny new red <unk> is coming from behind me like a bat out of hell 
 there 's a car in the lane next to me so there 's pretty much no way he 's gon na pass 
 at this point he 's only about a foot or less away from hitting my car and <unk> his engine for me to move like the asshole he is 
 i do n't usually let people like that pass but i made an exception 
 before switching to the other lane i checked to see if the cop was in his usual spot and goddamn did the petty revenge gods smile on me 
 there he was waiting with his <unk> 
 so i move out of the way to let the asshole through 
 as soon as he passes the park going about 30 <unk> faster than he should 've been the cop pulls out of the parking lot an flashes his lights 
 i <unk> all the way home 
 edit : it seems some of you are thinking that when i say i slowed down because occasionally there is a cop that i went from <unk> <unk> 
 this is n't the case 
 i was doing about 5 miles over the speed limit 30 <unk> and slowed down because i entered a school zone 
 it 's not worth it to me to throw away my life because of a kid running across the street and me not being able to stop 
 edit 2 : how i felt afterwards i am not a coffee <unk> 
 i just like fresh coffee 
 at my old office i would bring my own coffee in from a local <unk> 
 as time went on i noticed my coffee was <unk> and the office <unk> '' generic coffee was staying pretty full 
 it did n't take long to realize that the whole office <unk> fresh coffee as well 
 i really did n't mind this i just wanted us all to share the cost if we were sharing the coffee 
 i left a note on the bag asking for a small donation if brewing a batch 
 the note disappeared again and again and no <unk> were ever made 
 finally frustrated and coffee budget near <unk> i <unk> my revenge 
 i hid my amazing coffee in a plain generic bag inspired by the <unk> potato chip commercial 
 i then filled the original delicious coffee bag with 100 % decaf coffee 
 enjoy your morning <unk> you cheap bastards 
 tldr : stolen coffee replaced with decaf 
 <unk> ha <unk> sub came to mind immediately after this occurred so i think it 's a fitting story 
 a few weeks ago i was leaving the <unk> i work in after finishing a saturday morning class that i teach 
 the neighborhood is busy at these times due to the <unk> market next door to our campus and people looking for parking so cars are going up and down the two lane street between our front entrance and our parking lot directly across 
 luckily we have a traffic light and crosswalk joining the two that <unk> <unk> stop here for pedestrians 
 i hit the button to cross light turns red street is totally clear and i start to cross 
 at that moment a car approaches down the street 
 surely he will slow down and stop 
 nope not slowing <unk> there he goes through the light through the crosswalk past me and into our parking lot 
 what the hell 
 i was n't in danger so i was just annoyed 
 then as i 'm walking to my car guess who i notice is following me to take my space 
 no way man 
 no 
 way 
 i walk deliberately to my car avoiding eye contact get in buckle up and start the engine 
 making sure that the asshole driver is waiting for me to leave 
 i then call my brother to have a chat and kill some time 
 he does n't answer but that does n't stop me from pretending to be on the phone oblivious to the waiting car which is now holding up traffic 
 this goes on for what must have been eternity to the other driver as he waited for the moment that would never come 
 visibly frustrated he finally drives off 
 i end my imaginary phone call and immediately reverse and leave the space 
 he sees this and desperately tries to make his way around the parking lot but <unk> by the one-way <unk> only makes it back to my space in time to watch another car take it 
 was it petty 
 of course 
 was it satisfying 
 absolutely 
 forgive me a cruel chuckle ... during a flight from the uk to the us i was sat in an aisle seat minding my own business when the teen 13 - <unk> in the seat in front decides that rocking his seat is great fun 
 he does this for a few minutes while chuckling and looking through the gap between the seats before i give him the <unk> it again punk look 
 he stops for a while until the meals were handed out 
 tray down eating away the next thing i know is my drink is on my lap 
 the kid has started rocking the chair again 
 the attendant sees this and has a quiet word after getting me a new drink and <unk> i did say no need to as it was n't her 
 he tries it again and i get up to tell him enough is enough 
 he stops for about an hour 
 after landing and as we start unloading our bags the attendant walks past proceeds to get a heavy bag out of the locker above the kid and drops it on him 
 she <unk> then looks at me and smiles as she walks away 
 click here for part 4 : voicemails <unk> and click here for part 5 : mow & amp tell but i highly recommend you see what led up to this weird shit and yes i 'll continue <unk> the crazy as long as it keeps going 
 no i did n't get a <unk> order until after i got these messages 
 cops told me i should wait until after shelly 's hearing 
 yes i know i should n't have <unk> 've got a lot of these stories for you guys 
 i 'm pretty vindictive but in true canadian form i 'm also pretty passive aggressive 
 this usually leads to lots of petty revenge 
 this story though is by far my best revenge 
 it 's long but it 's a good <unk> 
 when i was 17 i moved across the country with my then boyfriend now husband 
 i was pretty <unk> when i got a job at a & amp amp amp amp w because it was my first real job and the pay was really good great compared to my former <unk> shit compared to the pay scale in this <unk> 
 i was working day shift and my manager told me it was very important to keep my own record of my hours because the computers did n't work to login 
 after getting my first <unk> and being short 8 hours i realized why it was so important 
 but the owner <unk> me the hours would be on my next cheque 
 i had worked there for about 2 months before being promoted to evening manager with a fairly <unk> raise of about $ <unk> 
 i was still owed about 24 hours of pay 
 technically my boss always put my missing hours on the next cheque but then i would be missing even more hours from the current pay period 
 things started getting really shitty 
 some of our kitchen staff quit and instead of replacing them he just moved around the 3 remaining kitchen staff so that we only had one person in the kitchen per shift 
 we were also really short on staff so i ended up working the counters in the mornings <unk> alone and then coming in for my regular evening shift <unk> 
 apparently my raise was only in name because my last 2 <unk> had my former <unk> on them my boss <unk> me that it would be on the next cheque 
 then came <unk> 
 for those of you who are n't familiar with the <unk> <unk> it 's the biggest event in the city 
 it 's a week long <unk> and <unk> where thousands of people flood the city drunk and wearing <unk> <unk> 
 our a & amp amp amp amp w was right downtown so needless to say it was a very busy week 
 we still only had one kitchen staff and me working the morning shift the day manager came in early to help with the counter and we tried all the staff to see if we could get extra <unk> but only one staff came in 
 breakfast was a nightmare 
 a & amp amp amp amp w <unk> are real breakfast made to order eggs bacon french toast none of it <unk> and there was no time to <unk> it anyway because the store was packed pretty much round the clock so with 1 person full time in back and one <unk> it was taking <unk> minutes per breakfast and the store was lined to the doors and the drive through lined up right into the street 
 we called the owner and told him he needed to come in right now because we needed him and his wife to help us 
 we were <unk> in angry customers 
 30 minutes pass and we call him again 
 i 'll be there right away '' is his <unk> line 
 another 30 minutes and he 's not here we call his house and get <unk> so we assume he is on his way 
 this is great because he does n't live far so he should be here in 10 minutes at the latest 
 it 's now 10am 2 hours since we first called and no answer on his house phone or his cell 
 we 've had lots of people walk out we 've had people demand refunds and leave but the store is still packed and there is still an hour left on breakfast but we have n't had a chance to prep lunch not even cut up the veggies for <unk> so we were still fucked come lunch 
 i look at the day manager and said fuck it i quit 
 he says you know what fuck this i quit too '' 
 we call the boss again and leave a message on both lines telling him we quit along with 2 other staff the only one that does n't is the 1 kitchen staff and we will stay for another 30 minutes to give him time to get here but then we are walking out 
 30 minutes pass and no word from the owner 
 we lock the doors and tell the customers in the store that their breakfast is free since they all have been waiting for so long and we are closing the store once all of them are served but they have to take their meals to go 
 we serve at lease 50 free <unk> at around $ 10 a piece once the store is empty we do our cash out drop it in the slot under the tills and get ready to leave 
 people were still coming in the drive through and trying to get in he door confused to why the store would be closed in the middle of the day during <unk> 
 when i went in to return my uniform i made sure to get the money that we were all owed 
 he paid us out of the till in cash because we refused to leave until he paid us 
 it means that i ended up with about $ 200 cash that was tax free so that 's a bonus 
 i did n't get a call until 2 hours later after the lunch rush from my former boss claiming we owed him all the money he lost while the store was <unk> the free <unk> 
 i told him he was well informed about what was going to happen we knew he got the message because we had filled his inbox and could n't leave any messages but when we called to tell him he store was closed the inbox was no longer full 
 he should n't have tried to call our <unk> because we were n't <unk> 
 he probably lost out on $ <unk> worth of sales or more from the store being closed for 3 hours and missing the lunch rush which on a normal day brought in about $ <unk> but during <unk> could easily bring in $ <unk> 
 this being <unk> in <unk> i got another job the next day 
 working as a secretary at parks canada making $ <unk> and never having to deal with cheap bosses or angry customers again 
 a fairly new guy i work with <unk> has n't quite gotten the job down yet 
 i 've given him the benefit of the doubt and have even <unk> him to my coworkers 
 for some reason people have a hard time remembering his name is <unk> and often call him <unk> 
 i always corrected people when they did n't say it right 
 he 's a pretty shy fellow but he opened up to me once about it and said he hates being called <unk> and that he <unk> when i corrected folks about it 
 well i finished my shift a couple days ago and had to stick around and pull a double because <unk> dropped the ball and did n't come to work 
 he ignored my phone calls and i ended up having to cover his shift until midnight 
 i 've been calling him <unk> '' ever since and now correct people when they call him <unk> 
 i was out one night having a few drinks with some friends when i check my phone to see i had a dozen missed calls from a random number 
 thinking nothing of it i continued my on with my night 
 the next day i find out from a female friend why i had been getting all these calls 
 i had told her in the past that if a guy was ever creepy towards her and asked for her number to just give him mine and i 'd deal with him 
 she was in a bar with a friend just enjoying themselves and having a few drinks 
 this guy comes up to her and starts hitting on her 
 immediately comes across as <unk> and arrogant 
 he 's making her and her friend so uncomfortable they decide to leave 
 they 're on the third floor and it 's packed so it takes them a good ten minutes to <unk> their way through the crowd and down all the stairs 
 douchebag follows them the entire way while the girls try to ignore him 
 they get outside and he starts following them up the road 
 they 're getting a little worried and it 's at this point he confirms their suspicions by yelling out it 's girls like you are the reason girls get <unk> '' 
 so they 're pretty fucking scared at this point and do n't know what to do so they both stop 
 they 're in a crowded area so they 'll be safer there than if they keep walking 
 he catches up to them they start chatting and <unk> the situation 
 he asks for one of the girls numbers 
 not wanting to give it to him she gives him mine instead 
 he then calls her phone and demands to check it to make sure it 's ringing and she did n't give him a fake number 
 somehow she <unk> him it was right 
 after hearing this story and realising he thought my number was my friends i decided to have a bit of fun with him 
 throughout the week i sent him text messages pretending to be my friend 
 <unk> for being <unk> as i was n't feeling well that night and yes i would love to see him again 
 with the help of my female friend who he threatened we led him on <unk> throughout the week for context he lived two hours away and was only in town for a special <unk> that night 
 i somehow managed to convince this guy to get on a train for two hours book a hotel in the hopes of getting laid and come meet me in a bar at a <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> around and i 'm chilling in a bar down the road with some friends having a few drinks female friend was there with me waiting to see what happened 
 he texts me that he 's there at <unk> 
 i let him <unk> for half an hour all while receiving texts and calls that i obviously did n't answer 
 i send him one brief text that i 'm running late and that i 'll be there soon 
 it <unk> him for a while 
 we manage to keep him there until 11pm alone in this bar 
 it 's at this point we do the big reveal 
 i send him a message saying from memory this is n't female friend 
 this is her guy friend 
 do n't ever threaten to <unk> my friend or anyone else ever again 
 if i hear about you doing anything like that again i 'll go straight to the police 
 consider tonight a lesson '' 
 as you can guess he went apeshit 
 dozens of calls which went <unk> and abusive messages 
 the best ones were when he threatened to have his cop buddy '' arrest me for some made up reason 
 my group of friends all thought this was hilarious 
 in the end we got his hopes up for a week and made him waste hundreds of <unk> 've worked with you before so i know what a <unk> cunt you are 
 you think you are hot shit because you work for the district and are n't a regular teacher like us common folk '' 
 you thought no one saw you roll your eyes at the questions the veteran teacher was asking during the workshop 
 but i saw you 
 you would never <unk> yourself to speak to her but if you had gotten outside your bubble for five minutes you would have learned she was a gifted teacher with 20+ years experience 
 you work for a failing district one of the worst in the country 
 you could have learned something from that woman but you were too busy being a snooty <unk> bitch 
 she did n't see you rolling your eyes at her <unk> questions but i did 
 well i 've always been an <unk> 
 i always show up ten minutes early for everything 
 so while you were shoving your face with free <unk> during the break i was in the classroom wiping some huge <unk> on your <unk> <unk> 
 the other day my mom asked me for some water 
 it would n't have annoyed me normally but she was much closer to the water dispenser than i was 
 so i only filled her glass up halfway 
 take that.i live in downtown <unk> and the particular area i 'm in has very limited parking 
 especially on a saturday night 
 i was driving around looking for a spot and <unk> of <unk> saw a huge space on the street enough for 2 maybe even 3 cars ... but it was on the other side of the road 
 so i turn around and start going for it 
 lo and behold the guy in front of me saw the same space and does the same thing 
 i patiently wait for him to park 
 he <unk> his car once 
 twice 
 then opens the door and leaves 
 he was perfectly in the middle 
 there was no space on either side of him to park 
 i was livid 
 it took me 10 more minutes to find another spot much <unk> from my apartment and i was fuming the entire time 
 i finally got home and tried to put it out of my mind 
 a few minutes later the dog needed to be walked 
 i took him around the block and he decided to poop right next to the guy 's car 
 i 'm willing to admit that the idea of writing choice <unk> on his car crossed my mind 
 however since petty is the name of the game i bagged up the poop nice and neat and gently laid the bag on his door handle 
 no mess no smell ... but i hope he got the <unk> have a neighbor that refuses to clean up after her huge ass dog 
 as a dog owner myself i know picking up shit is gross but we live in an area that people walk <unk> 
 her dog has shit the size of grown humans 
 after numerous requests to clean it up shame talks about how others have stepped in it <unk> how it smells etc 
 she still refuses to take care of her animal responsibly 
 i 've had enough 
 i stepped in a fresh pile again 
 this time in brand new shoes 
 i 'm fucking done 
 i <unk> up several huge pieces of her dogs shit and put them <unk> on her door mat 
 i 'm hoping that she steps in it on her way inside her place 
 she wo n't know who left it there because every neighbor has complained and we have several new people in our area 
 i <unk> hope she steps in it 
 i wo n't know for sure but damn ... that would give me good feels for months 
 update : this is a <unk> type place so our units are connected 
 we share a common parking area and lawn area 
 in order to get into my place i have to walk near the lawn area 
 her dog likes to shit on the sidewalk 
 did i mention his shit is huge 
 i 'm not sure if she stepped in it 
 she is n't the type of person to come over and tell me 
 i 'm out of town for a week but another neighbor is taking a turn while i 'm away 
 my <unk> <unk> teacher told me she refused to assign me a coursework project because i missed the lesson where the coursework was arranged 
 i had told her beforehand that i 'd being absent to go to my brother 's funeral 
 she shouted at me for 5 minutes saying i was n't her responsibility that i did n't take my education seriously and i 'd have to get zero for the coursework <unk> which meant losing 20 % 
 every time i opened my mouth to suggest a solution she got <unk> 
 i went to speak to the head of science who was shocked at how she 'd treated me and agreed i 'd done nothing wrong 
 my <unk> teacher kept being a bitch to me after that so i swapped her <unk> pens for permanent <unk> 
 she got through three quarters of the lesson before realizing 
 even if i had got caught the ensuing meltdown was well worth it 
 i started feeling sorry for her after she started crying so i told her going over it with a dry erase pen and rubbing it off might work 
 she had to explain to the next teacher that he could n't use one panel of the board because she used the wrong pens 
 she spent the entire lunch break getting it <unk> not be very petty but a pretty satisfying story i just remembered 
 several years ago a major <unk> blew through my hometown and the government issued a damage repair to all houses effected by the storm after <unk> through insurance companies something to that extent 
 construction <unk> took advantage of the situation going door to door offering their services 
 <unk> get money everyone gets free <unk> why not 
 whole <unk> signed on and work began 
 my parents were getting their home <unk> and after a time realized the amount they were <unk> for was too high so they planned to break the contract and find someone else to do all the <unk> and replace all the <unk> and window <unk> for the same price 
 while on the phone with the contractor he tells them they 're willing to to do all the extra work for free so my parents stay with the original <unk> 
 after many many months the work was done and the guys came to collect except they did n't replace the <unk> and window <unk> 
 my father <unk> the money because they admit to lying about the extra work in order to keep the contract but refuse to do it because they did n't write up the new contract for my dad to sign so they 're not <unk> to do it yet wanted our money 
 this <unk> into arguments with them threatening to sue us 
 a couple days later after discussing this with the family we have them over for a meeting and agree to pay them extra but discounted amount to do the <unk> and <unk> 
 they come back and finish the work 
 when the time came for them to receive their pay they visit the house and my mother gives them the check 
 they realize that the amount was for the original work without the additional pay as agreed 
 they get pissed 
 my mother <unk> replies to them that since they did n't sign a <unk> contract she was not <unk> to pay them the extra amount 
 they left without much of a fight 
 tl dr get it on <unk> last night my dad took me out to dinner at an indian restaurant just us my brother and mom do n't like spicy food 
 for a little context we 're dutch living in the us which is where this takes place 
 when we ordered our food the waiter repeatedly corrected my dad 's <unk> of the dishes we were getting and i could see him my dad getting slightly annoyed 
 so when we got our food and the waiter asked if we wanted another round of drinks my dad ordered a dutch beer 
 <unk> so he could correct the way the waiter <unk> <unk> he does n't even like that type of beer all that much 
 every morning before work i go to a drive through of some variety and get coffee 
 because i am courteous i usually <unk> lower my car radio when entering the drive though lane so people can hear the order taker and vice <unk> 
 well this morning a special snowflake decided they should just cut me right off 
 luckily i have good brakes and know how to drive in the rain and there was n't an accident 
 oh and a little added <unk> drive a diesel mercedes 
 they are not a quiet car to start with and on occasion i 've been asked to kill my engine so the person wearing the headset can hear me 
 so since you are clearly so much more important than me enjoy saying what 
 what 
 can you repeat that '' 
 as i roll my window down and turn up the dance music i was enjoying 
 i moved into a super crappy extended stay hotel for a week because my apartment lease ran up on friday and i ca n't move into my new place until wednesday 
 horrible management ghetto furniture weird smell half working heater but whatever i 'm a single guy right 
 suck it up save a few bucks by staying in a <unk> place 
 we 'll along with all that are paper thin walls and a horrible neighbor that moved in yesterday 
 they have a dog that barked all day <unk> and when they finally got home they turned their tv volume way up 
 i went and knocked on their door twice asking to turn it down with no result 
 did n't get to sleep until 1 when they finally turned it off 
 cut to today i 've had 3 more hours of dog barking until they got home and then dancing with the stars <unk> way up followed by what i think is <unk> grace coverage of <unk> and they wo n't even answer the door this time 
 i 'm done at this point so i hooked up my laptop <unk> the tv and hit play on a 30 minute <unk> cat loop 
 i 'm ready to fight dirty 
 up next is heavy metal from my high school days 
 <unk> the tv at the end of typing this i 've won 
 they turned it down 
 tldr : hotel room next door are jerks and wo n't turn down tv or quiet their dog 30 minutes of <unk> cat full volume 
 now quiet tv and quiet <unk> my apartment complex we have an under cover <unk> 
 each apartment usually has one car space and there is plenty of visitor spots 
 now my parents were coming to visit so i parked in a visitor spot so my space would be free for them when they arrived 
 as i was getting out of my car the lady from another apartment <unk> me 
 asking me <unk> you even live here 
 <unk> on the <unk> blah blah you ca n't park there it 's for visitors 
 i own my home are you renting 
 she just kept going on and on 
 i told her to go shove it and i do n't have to explain anything to her 
 there 's no rules against residents parking in visitor spots in the <unk> rules 
 i will mention that she was a single lady in her mid <unk> 
 i 'm in my twenties and live with my partner 
 she walks around with a 'i 'm better than you <unk> 
 a <unk> at me i own my apartment and you guys rent attitude 
 i was so mad that this lady had confronted me that when i got inside i told my partner 
 then he told me to look out the window 
 the lady was there bitching about me to other residents 
 it took so much strength for me to not <unk> her house or something stupid that i would regret 
 i played it cool 
 it 's been four months since the incident 
 so as revenge i 've stared to put all my junk mail in her letter box 
 we have a <unk> <unk> bin for <unk> junk mail 
 it has hi <unk> upon hundreds of <unk> etc 
 i grab a large handful or three everytime i check the mail and put them in her letter box 
 she keeps complaining at the <unk> meetings of the <unk> of <unk> she gets weekly 
 i win lady 
 edit : words 
 long but worth it i hope 
 throwaway account in case anyone i know reads this 
 <unk> : the rental situation in this city is horrific so i decide to save a little money by moving into a <unk> apartment with a friend of a friend 
 the situation begins to go south barely a month into our one year lease with new roommate let 's call her <unk> starting out by being just a little nuts and <unk> into stealing my <unk> clothes money <unk> even underwear 
 and i don’t mean borrow without asking i mean disappear into her <unk> never to be seen again 
 instead of taking the <unk> for breaking my lease i decide to wait out the rest of the year 
 i buy a lock for my bedroom door and move most of my things into my bedroom except for sofa tv <unk> etc which stay in the living room 
 the story : in the final days of our lease we each begin to move out when i come home from work and find <unk> things gone – along with my tv <unk> and everything else that she had had access to 
 now none of this was brand new <unk> most of it was my <unk> <unk> or second hand <unk> but there was no way i could afford to replace them 
 also i had no way to prove that these items were mine second hand 
 i knew it would be her word against mine and when i called her demanding my things back this is exactly how it played out 
 the revenge : this could have been the end of just another bad roommate story but <unk> had left one last precious thing to move out : her wedding dress 
 <unk> was getting married in two months 
 it was too good an opportunity to pass up and the dress went with me 
 it didn’t take too long to get the first phone call 
 over the next few days i ignored at least thirty phone calls from her 
 i was prepared to just trade for my things back but then i got a registered letter from a lawyer demanding the return of the dress 
 i really didn’t want to blow the issue up any further so i got out her beautiful <unk> designer <unk> dress and prepared to return it 
 i stuffed it into the smallest box possible about the size of a shoe box 
 i could hear <unk> ripping as i crammed it in 
 but that’s not it 
 i just so happened to have a friend that was headed to europe and was very happy to put the dress in her suitcase 
 when she arrived i had my friend send the dress cash on delivery 
 i can only imagine the look on <unk> face as she finally got her dress days before her wedding and then not only had to pay for the delivery but also needed to get it cleaned pressed and prepared for her big day 
 this morning i <unk> to my sister showering in my shower 
 i get up at 6:30 to ensure that i make it to work on time 
 it is very consistent and <unk> 
 for a little bit of petty revenge i jumped in the other shower and turned it as hot as it would allow 
 we have a small hot water heater so this ran the tank empty in a matter of minutes and she loves long showers 
 for an added bit of petty i ate the last <unk> for breakfast 
 do n't take my <unk> introverted best friend and i enter our favorite sandwich shop for a <unk> lunch and i tell him everything that we do today is on me 
 he orders first while i figure out what <unk> sub i want 
 he finishes his order and pays before my sandwich comes out of the <unk> 
 i rush over and push him saying so it 's going to be that way '' 
 cashier shoots me a <unk> look 
 i tell her that it 's his birthday 
 she tells us to wait as if we had a choice because she 's holding our plates <unk> and <unk> what seems like all the employees to <unk> happy birthday 
 best part : cashier forgot to ask his <unk> was exiting the freeway and there was a guy with a sign asking for help 
 i rolled down my window and gave him a dollar 
 he held the dollar up and said just a dollar 
 just as he finished saying that i quickly grabbed it back and rolled up the window 
 no dollar for <unk> <unk> : the car in question is a <unk> toyota <unk> 
 i know she 's is a lame <unk> car but <unk> is my baby and i 'm very protective of her 
 i was in the parking lot of a <unk> joe 's and a starbucks - parked but still sitting in my car probably <unk> around with my phone 
 some guy in an enormous white pick up truck pulls into the parking spot next to me on my passenger 's side then opens his door - bam - straight into the side of my car twice 
 he was so high up in the truck that he could n't see that i was in my car and he got out and walked away without so much as looking to see if he 'd caused any damage 
 so i backed out of the parking spot and pulled back into it this time so ridiculously close to his truck that no one could possibly open the driver 's side door far enough to get in never mind this hefty <unk> dude 
 then i got some coffee and watched from the window of starbucks as the guy returned to his truck looked confused walked in a circle or two around both our vehicles then <unk> hauled himself in through his passenger 's side door and over his center console 
 touch <unk> and i <unk> slightly inconvenience you 
 today i went to the beach 
 the beach has sand i get this 
 i fully expect to get sand in places i did n't even know existed 
 however there was a kid who kept <unk> sand onto my towel and myself 
 i can deal with a couple times because he 's just a kid and it happens 
 but after almost a dozen times ... nah son 
 i got his attention and asked him to watch where he 's throwing his sand building a <unk> and his parents who i had n't heard a <unk> out of the entire time turned to me and told me to stop telling their child what to do and that it 's just sand '' 
 ok cool 
 so i just let him keep kicking and throwing sand onto my towel 
 i read my book ate my chips and people watched 
 this went on for about two hours 
 i had a decent amount of sand piled onto my towel by this time 
 and then it was time to leave 
 anyone who goes to the beach at least in <unk> knows that it can be pretty windy 
 guess what way the wind was blowing 
 i gathered my things and then picked up my towel 
 but instead of being courteous and making it so sand did n't fly in their direction i just let loose 
 it hit them all at once and the mom <unk> excuse you could you watch what you 're doing '' 
 to which my response was a cool it 's only sand '' 
 ha 
 hope it sticks to them for hours 
 ok. so i work in a call center 
 we have me : a worker bee 
 we go to our assigned <unk> tech support <unk> if we have computer issues 
 we go to our direct supervisor if we have other issues 
 they are not the same person and the <unk> holds absolutely no power over us but she likes to think she does 
 so one day it gets busy 
 i mean no time to breathe ca n't get up from your desk busy 
 boss man says afternoon breaks are cancelled 
 this happens maybe once or twice a year 
 but i 'm sick 
 its hard to breathe let alone <unk> talk 
 if we have to get away from our computers we have to put our status as break '' so we do not get calls when away from our desks 
 i got up a few times to get water or <unk> 
 was gone for no longer than 30 seconds each time 
 well nosy little <unk> <unk> me each time <unk> maybe you did n't see the email but we are not taking breaks today '' 
 i ignored it 3 times 
 the next time i fucked with her a bit 
 when i knew my direct supervisor was at her desk i went into break '' status 
 i heard her jump up and say to my manager she did it again 
 come on i 'll show you '' 
 put myself right back into <unk> '' status and got a call 
 <unk> and boss man get to my desk and <unk> <unk> but but she just went on break 
 i swear '' 
 boss man says <unk> this is ridiculous 
 in the time you 've spent <unk> her you could have been doing work '' and walks away 
 i smiled at <unk> and continued working 
 get off my tits <unk> i gave him just slightly less <unk> in his glass than the people he was dining with 
 take that <unk> pulled up to the mall in the afternoon to catch a movie and i see this all black <unk> charger double parked in the very first <unk> row 
 usually i do n't really bother but i happened to have a pen and post-it left over from work 
 i wrote a little note on his driver 's side window i keyed your car good luck finding it '' 
 by the time i got done with the movie it was dark and i see the douche bag using his phone as a <unk> trying to find the scratch and huffing and puffing looking around to see if anyone was <unk> at him 
 i do n't know how long he was there before i came back but i sat there and laughed from within my car for at least 15 minutes 
 and no i did not actually scratch his car 
 **the setup : ** while in college i also worked full time for the university it help desk 
 as anyone who worked full time through college can tell you it can make scheduling time to talk to <unk> a bit tight so i had to become a pro at sneaking minutes here and there for questions about class with a lot of <unk> and sent a lot of emails 
 most <unk> were incredibly understanding 
 one 
 not so much 
 **the offense : ** after class i approached the professor as he was packing up his stuff with some questions about a particularly complicated bit of material 
 me : hi sir i was wondering if i could ask you a quick question about something we went over last class '' 
 <unk> : i 'm sorry no 
 i 'm very busy '' 
 me : of course i understand and i would n't want to hold you up 
 i 'd be happy to walk with you so i do n't keep you from anything 
 it 's just i tried <unk> you an -- '' <unk> : ugh i <unk> email '' 
 me : right sure which is why i thought i 'd <unk> -- '' <unk> : look 
 let me make it perfectly clear 
 i have clearly <unk> office hours when you can come by and ask me any question your heart <unk> '' 
 me : of course 
 it 's just that i work over at the help desk and my work schedule completely <unk> your office hours so i ca n't get by to -- '' <unk> : yes yes that sounds like a terrible problem 
 it 's just not *my* problem 
 i have over 600 students a semester if i let you <unk> on my personal time then i 'll have to do the same for everyone and it 'd be chaos 
 that 's why keeping a schedule is so important '' 
 me : sigh of course sir 
 i 'll figure it out '' 
 note : this little lecture on the <unk> of strict scheduling took longer than answering my question likely would have 
 **the revenge : ** a week of so later in that same class the professor had barely started into the lecture when the podium he was running his powerpoint from threw a few errors and the display shut off 
 a <unk> of random button presses <unk> language and a <unk> this is why i hate computers '' later the <unk> was unable to get the display to come back up 
 <unk> his eyes swept the classroom until he found me 
 <unk> : you 
 you work in it right 
 do you know what 's going on up here '' 
 me : of course sir '' 
 <unk> : well then get up here and get this going again '' 
 me : i 'm sorry no '' 
 the entire class spun to look at me and his eyes <unk> 
 <unk> : ... 
 no '' 
 me : that 's correct sir 
 you see i have very clearly <unk> work hours at the help desk 
 if you want to come by during those i 'd be happy to help 
 it 's just that i support <unk> people each semester and if i provided support for you during my personal time i 'd have to do it for everyone else and it 'd be chaos 
 you understand right '' 
 <unk> clearly mad : but if you do n't i ca n't -- '' me : yes sir and that 's a terrible problem 
 it 's just not *my* problem 
 i 'm sure you understand 
 as you told me just recently keeping to a schedule is very important '' 
 the classroom was dead silent and the professor stood there seething with fury and staring me down and puffed up as if preparing for an epic meltdown ... then i saw the flash of recognition of he realized i 'd just <unk> back his own argument nearly verbatim and he just started laughing tears <unk> down his face 
 when he finally <unk> himself he just said fine you win 
 you ... '' he stared <unk> at the rest of the class for emphasis and only you can ask me questions outside of office hours 
 no one else 
 now will you please come fix this '' 
 me : of course sir 
 i 'd be happy to '' 
 <unk> : ** while i was up front he leaned if real close to speak to me 
 <unk> : you know i could have kicked you out of my class for that right 
 maybe even gotten you fired '' 
 me : sure 
 but then i could have just remotely deleted every file on your hard drive destroying years of work you almost certainly do n't keep backed up anywhere else '' 
 <unk> : wait ... you ca n't do that ... can you '' 
 me : i hope you never have to find out '' 
 **tl dr : professor refuses <unk> help to it <unk> outside of office hours 
 later has it problem in class <unk> uses <unk> 's reasoning to refuse it help outside of work 
 <unk> <unk> 
 everyone wins 
 ** i 've lived in the same house for the last 16 years 
 it 's a two family house and my landlord is an ok guy but can be a dick about things 
 when we first moved there we were n't allowed any pets and could not park in the driveway 
 i understand you do n't want animals ruining the house and what not but his reasoning was his 30 year old son is allergic '' to cats and dogs he lived in the basement we live on the top floor 
 there is no way he would even be <unk> by any of the animals but your house your rules 
 we also were n't allowed to park in the driveway a bit of an annoyance because when we first moved in the landlord said it would not be a problem 
 my mother being a single mom raising two kids did n't have a car at the time so that was n't much of an issue for us 
 fast forward a couple of years and we get a car but ca n't use the driveway 
 my mother tells him he promised we could and the landlord says he never said that and we ca n't use it 
 the rent goes up during the years and my mother speaks with him again and he says ok sure you can use it as long as it does n't affect my daily routine 
 my mother is out of the house by 6am every morning and he is a retired old man who usually does work around the house and will walk to the grocery store etc 
 so it never messed up his routine 
 a few months ago he tells us he we ca n't park in the driveway anymore because his sons need to go in and out and it 's an inconvenience to them 
 they usually block the driveway do what they must and leave 
 so i did n't understand what the issue was 
 one of his 4 sons lives in <unk> and has come to visit for about 3-4 months 
 my landlord being an old man does not have use for the internet and most likely does n't know what it is but his son would like to check his e-mails skype his family probably jerk off in general use his computer 
 in order to do that you need wi-fi unfortunately for him i 'm the only one who has the wi-fi password my mom and sister just ask me whenever they need help with computer stuff including setting up the wi-fi for their <unk> 
 the son asks my mother and sister and they both say you must speak to <unk> about that he 's the only one who knows it '' 
 a couple weeks go by and we see each other going in and out of the house and finally he asks me for the password along with the douchey allergic to all fucking animals '' brother 
 finally i get my revenge 
 and i refuse to use allow them access to my precious wi-fi because i do n't feel comfortable letting others use it because of the <unk> to personal information and viruses blah blah blah '' plus i pay for it why the hell should they get to use it for free 
 the look on their faces was priceless 
 they were so angry but could n't do a damn thing about it 
 now if he wants to use the wi-fi he has to drive 20 minutes to his brothers house and use it <unk> decided to go grocery shopping 
 actually i had decided to go buy some <unk> in the <unk> of grocery shopping 
 hey two birds with one <unk> 
 <unk> are my favorite food ever and they are quite a <unk> when i 'm having a bad day 
 now i was almost done with my shopping and wheel my cart around to the produce section where i see the small fruit display with small stacked <unk> of <unk> 
 i <unk> made a <unk> for them 
 suddenly a lady comes up to them from the other side her cart blocking my way and taking up the small aisle in front of the <unk> 
 i really wanted those <unk> so i just backed up a bit and patiently waited for her to be done 
 she took a <unk> of <unk> 
 then another 
 and another 
 and another 
 and another 
 and another 
 i see her glance up at me and i 'm not too worried 
 i 'm just happily waiting for a chance to <unk> in a get a <unk> or two of my precious fruit 
 but she goes on <unk> up each <unk> and putting it into her cart 
 <unk> i 'm panicking 
 surely this lady would n't take 30+ <unk> of <unk> 
 there are only a few left so i speak up 
 <unk> excuse me '' 
 i ask nervously but politely 
 she looks up 
 then like that piece of shit kid that used to push all the other kids aside to take the last good ball went you went out for recess this lady ... this middle-aged lady gave me the most triumphant obnoxious smirk lifted the last <unk> into her cart turned around and walked off 
 outwardly i was shocked standing there with my mouth <unk> open <unk> quietly and thinking <unk> ... did that <unk> lady really just pull that shit 
 * <unk> i was screaming 
 i was in a <unk> mood 
 my main reason for shopping now ruined and i had a <unk> feeling that my <unk> for delicious <unk> would leave me feeling empty inside 
 i make one last <unk> round to collect when i had forgotten and <unk> pushed my cart up to the checkout counter 
 to my annoyance as i looked up take a guess who i had ended up behind in line 
 <unk> thief 
 i was mad and i was about to pull out and go into another line 
 however ... <unk> thief was busy <unk> with her bag in line and did n't even notice me 
 i glanced into the back of her cart only to realize that barely <unk> out of the back were the <unk> glory : dozens of <unk> of <unk> 
 at this point i did n't even care 
 very slowly carefully and quietly but without taking my eyes off her stupid back i reached into her <unk> and pulled out <unk> <unk> three <unk> of delicious <unk> 
 she failed to notice me and went ahead with her purchase 
 but bitch i got my fruit 
 suck it.i work 6 days a week 
 occasionally like once a month i 'll get a day off in the middle of the week 
 this is my <unk> day 
 a day to sit back watch tv catch up on my book and basically just <unk> around and do nothing 
 last wednesday was my day off 
 i have n't had one since the middle of may 
 i - was - excited 
 tuesday night i get a call from my mom saying she <unk> me to watch my two nephews the very next day 
 they are four years old and two years old 
 i tell her it 's my day off 
 and she says i know that 's why i <unk> you '' 
 fuming 
 so the next day i go over to her house at <unk> and <unk> 
 my sister 's already dropped the nephews off 
 my mom leaves to run errands and do other things that will take her till about <unk> 
 nephews are driving me crazy 
 i love <unk> but i can only take them for so long 
 suddenly the older of the two says he 's hungry 
 i go to the fridge to see what 's inside 
 my eyes zero in on my mother 's expensive mini <unk> cheese rolls and a whole box of see 's <unk> <unk> 
 yes 
 yes i did 
 i fed them every last cheese roll and chocolate truffle 
 it was satisfying 
 oh so very satisfying 
 needless to say she was angry 
 but you <unk> me to babysit on my day off i 'll feed the kids your expensive cheese and <unk> worked at a restaurant in a <unk> in vegas 
 i do n't want to get into complaining about tips and whatnot that 's a different subreddit but i did get some nicely petty revenge one night 
 it was a table with 10 <unk> 
 i greeted them introduced myself gave everyone a menu told them the special and went through the drink menu 
 a few minutes later i was standing in a corner chatting with a manager while watching my section 
 it was obvious the big table was still going through the <unk> 
 one man from the table walked up to the manager and told him that they had been here 10 minutes had yet to see their server and had been trying to flag someone down to take their order none of this was true so he probably did n't recognize that i was his server 
 i apologized profusely while knowing i was right and escorted him back to the table to take their order 
 i offered to start with the ladies knowing no one was ready except for him 
 i went to the man 's wife and asked what she would like to drink 
 she went red and asked me to skip her 
 so did every single other woman at the table 
 i went back to the guy who complained and asked if i should continue he told me to go away 
 everyone was nice but him 
 i <unk> and scraped to not get a complaint but he made up for his first complaint going wrong by being unhappy with everything 
 at the end he had a long talk with the manager who would n't tell me what was said 
 he charged the check to his room and <unk> his identity with his passport and complained about the wait because they had the <unk> flight out of vegas to catch 
 now i 'm a really nice guy 
 i do n't get upset over <unk> things i know life and each night <unk> out in the end and i would never mess with someone 's food 
 but when i picked up the check and saw his passport still inside ... i immediately had the urge to <unk> them through the <unk> to return it i 've done it many times with cc or id 
 instead i did what i was supposed to do and left it with the hostess who locked it in the manager 's office safe because we were about to close 
 which means the <unk> he could retrieve it was when we open at 11am the next day 
 good luck <unk> your international <unk> happened more than 10 years ago but after stumbling onto this <unk> i wanted to share 
 i was a senior in high school at the time 
 i had already gotten all of my college stuff in and was in the process of finishing up all the work to <unk> everything for the college i chose 
 this was about 3 weeks before christmas on a friday and i got my parents to sign a form for me to leave school early so i can get some christmas shopping done 
 sweet 
 i drive to the mall and buy all of the things i need and actually spent a lot less than i thought 
 i was 100 % in the christmas <unk> and just enjoying my day 
 i get in my car and stop for gas 
 feeling in a cheery mood i figured i would top my day off with a code red mountain dew <unk> from the gas station 
 fuck it 
 biggest size they got 
 heading home there is this large bridge that i need to cross 
 they happen to be doing construction on this bridge so after the first <unk> of the bridge the outside lane is closed leaving only the middle lane 
 i am at the light before the bridge in the middle lane 
 light turns green and i continue on my way 
 as i get to the point where the outside lane needs to merge i realize that this lady in a <unk> new mercedes sped right up on my right in the outside lane 
 she must have hit the light at the right time where she did n't have to stop and still had a lot of speed 
 however i was well ahead of her 
 she tried speeding around me in the outside lane and almost pushed me into the wall trying to cut me off getting into the middle lane 
 i 'm annoyed and just continue driving and she gets behind me 
 in my rear view mirror all i see are arm movements and middle fingers 
 i <unk> return one 
 petty yes but i think it 's over 
 until i get to the stop light at the other side 
 the lady in the mercedes pulls up next to me and rolls down her window shouting at me 
 i am now in the open outside lane making a left 
 i roll down my window to return expletives of my own but i do n't even get time to say anything 
 she is yelling shit along the lines of you fucking teenagers do n't know how to drive '' 
 fucking inconsiderate kids these days '' 
 just being a bitch because i would n't allow her to rudely cut me off 
 i 'm just annoyed at this point that this lady and her actions are putting so much <unk> in my otherwise amazing day and <unk> my holiday cheer 
 rather than say anything i grab my huge <unk> of code red <unk> and throw it outside of my open window and it hits her passenger seat <unk> and <unk> everywhere 
 ice cold bright red liquid goes everywhere 
 all over her face 
 all over her windows 
 and most importantly all over the leather seats in her nice mercedes 
 i give her a merry fucking christmas '' and continue my peaceful drive home 
 i am so happy that the gas station offered such a massive and unreasonable size for their <unk> that day 
 our downstairs neighbour like to play dance music at <unk> times of the day so loud that it makes our furniture <unk> 
 despite being told lots of times that we do n't appreciate it he still feels 7am on a sunday morning is a good time for that <unk> 
 however we <unk> a new set of speakers and a <unk> 
 next time we heard him we put on <unk> through the new kit and left it on for a minute <unk> and then turned it off 
 turns out shitty downstairs neighbour had turned his down 
 success at first i was finding cigarette butts strewn around the front of our <unk> apartment building but only from one person 
 he is a heavy smoker and the family that lived above me when i first moved in warned that he was bad about this 
 nobody else in out unit smokes and i 've never seen anyone from the adjacent units smoking outside either it 's not allowed inside the <unk> 
 i started picking up his cigarette butts and <unk> them near his door as a nice way of reminding him to throw out his own trash rather than <unk> up the building i also pay <unk> rent to live within 
 one day i found the smoking gun as i was taking my dog out for a morning walk a <unk> cigarette next to his car 
 i <unk> it at his door as i was on a time crunch before work and he just so happened to open the door seconds later 
 i was the only one in <unk> so one could put two and two together 
 he was giving me a dirty look later as i pulled out of my parking spot 
 cut to <unk> i find all the cigarette butts i had tossed from the night before strewn around my door 
 oh okay ... so it 's other people 's responsibility to clean up your shit 
 well i was n't about to play that game so i contacted the apartment office to let them know what was going on and they informed me they would post a note to his door warning him to either buy an <unk> for outside or to throw them away lest he be hit with a lease violation 
 i think they are $ 75 i get home from my fourth <unk> 12 hour work day in a rolling metal box in direct texas <unk> to find the butts once again <unk> my doorway as well as a <unk> smoked one with the ash still on it 
 i shrugged went inside sprayed all the butts down with <unk> cooking oil and put them back outside in an old pile of bird shit from a nest that was knocked down over his door 
 when he picks them up he 's going to wonder what vile <unk> just <unk> his hand 
 i went ahead and sent a follow up message to the office to let them know this was escalating and that i would rather they confront him than myself 
 so now that fool is going to get a greasy hand and a rent <unk> my step brother is a freshman in high school him and his father have an arrangement where his father will call him about 15 minutes to see if he is awake and ready for school 
 all week he has turned his phone off so his alarm does n't go off and his dad cant call him so he calls me instead 
 every day this week i have had to wake up early for the just to make sure he gets to school 
 today he missed the bus for the third day in a row so i plotted my revenge quickly 
 i grabbed my bluetooth speaker and my phone has a speaker boost app which i set to 15 <unk> 
 i <unk> it up and drive him to school with the car radio on 
 as we pull up to the school i turn the radio down put the speaker on the dash roll the windows down and hit play 
 driving up to the front door every single student who was outside heard barbie girl from the car and saw a pissed off step brother in the front seat 
 he does n't say a word but i feel the hatred <unk> off him 
 right before he got out i stopped him and said so i guess you 'll make the bus on monday huh buddy '' 
 he told me to eat a dick and ran off into the school 
 tl dr <unk> interrupts my sleep because he does n't want to go to school 
 i take him to school and blast barbie girl to ruin his <unk> 'm married 
 all married couples get on each other 's nerves if you 're doing it right 
 so i have figured out a good petty revenge for him 
 whenever he gets on my nerves real bad i go onto his youtube account and watch videos that he hates 
 so the next time he opens his youtube videos he can not stand are in his <unk> or watch again <unk> 
 ha that 'll teach him 
 i used to work at a chain fast food restaurant in the midwest 
 the job in general sucked but one customer stands out in particular 
 i was working on the drive-thru window for the first time and i 'll admit i was a little stressed 
 during the height of our lunch rush a car pulled up to the speaker with some shitty pop music blasting 
 hi welcome to -- '' the driver shouted something <unk> to me that i could n't hear over the loud music so i said i 'm sorry could you repeat that '' 
 she shut the music off and practically shouted fuck are you deaf 
 i want a number whatever her order was ... and a large chili '' 
 did you want the number # sandwich or the meal '' 
 but she had already pulled up 
 i rang up the sandwich alone since it was easier to change to a meal like that rather than the other way around 
 she pulled up to the window which i opened so i could clarify her order 
 before i could ask she immediately complained that i had n't given her total to her questioning my intelligence all the while 
 patience <unk> i rang in her correct order i want the damn meal duh 
 with a diet coke '' 
 and began gathering her meal together taking another order at the same time 
 she shot me a look through the window making a gesture along the lines of hurry up '' as i was bagging her chili 
 that was it 
 <unk> to popular <unk> restaurant workers are not likely to <unk> in your food as the <unk> far <unk> the reward 
 and i would feel guilty if i did any of those things 
 so i did the <unk> option 
 she had a sandwich fries a drink and a large chili 
 so rather than put a spoon in her bag i threw in two <unk> and a <unk> 
 i handed her bag out the window and gave her my <unk> have a nice day 
 leaving her to drive off with a chili and nothing but a straw to eat it with 
 maybe it 's petty but it still makes me giggle to this day 
 **tl dr** have fun eating chili through a straw asshole 
 edit : holy shit gold was unexpected 
 for real thanks internet friend 
 ** <unk> <unk> <unk> year i worked drive-thru for a popular fast food chain 
 the job was kinda shit by itself but the manager ... guys she was shit 
 we 'll call her <unk> because that was her real fucking name 
 yelling at employees constantly cutting hours out of spite not <unk> time off requests the whole nine yards 
 she was just a nasty person i can not honestly bring to mind any remotely positive interaction i had with her 
 just ... god 
 i needed the money and i did n't <unk> myself too much in my job i just did my thing and left 
 thus i managed to <unk> <unk> for a while 
 but after a particularly awful string of bullshit i went looking for another job 
 i found one -- better pay better hours 
 i wrote up a <unk> notice like a good employee and was planning on handing it in my next shift until i found out that <unk> had essentially forced my favorite co-worker to quit 
 he wanted saturday off to attend his grandmother 's funeral 
 <unk> said absolutely not 
 after trying to negotiate and failing he informed <unk> that he no longer worked for the franchise 
 i immediately knew what i was going to do 
 i threw my notice in the trash 
 for those of you that have never worked fast food corporate is always breathing down your neck 
 if the customer does not get their food within 90 seconds of ordering corporate knows about it immediately thanks to the <unk> of technology 
 they have their eye on all kinds of shit -- production times employee hours <unk> tray times order <unk> i mean all kinds of shit 
 you ca n't even toss out a chicken <unk> that hit the floor without marking it down 
 there are plenty of ways to get around this stuff resetting <unk> tray <unk> hitting served before you actually push the <unk> out the window and if you do n't find ways to get around it your managers will hate you 
 i was going to fuck that shit up pretty <unk> 
 the revenge : i went in for my final shift clocked in ten minutes early corporate alarm # 1 and got promptly yelled at by <unk> 
 she turned and began walking away 
 i waited till she was reasonably outside of earshot and quietly said i quit '' 
 the grill guy heard me 
 no one else did 
 my ass was covered 
 so i go to man booth 2. the dinner rush is starting to pick up 
 i 'm getting a line 
 problem is **i do n't work there anymore 
 ** customers are asking me what the hell is going on and i basically say i 'm so sorry but i just got let go i 'm waiting for clearance to leave 
 orders are piling up beside me but the assistant manager does n't seem to notice as he had a <unk> to get absorbed in his work 
 cars are starting to pile up 
 the line <unk> past the order menu and starts working its way around the parking lot 
 the lady at my window has been waiting for her order for a few minutes now if only there was an actual employee <unk> the window 
 the order screen has gone mysteriously blank 
 why it 's as if cars ca n't make it to the screen to order 
 which of course they ca n't because i 'm not handing out any fucking food 
 no one has noticed the empty screen because everyone is busy preparing for the next run and the dudes working the sandwich table were not exactly <unk> league material 
 again corporate keeps an eye on everything and nothing <unk> their <unk> worse than long wait times 
 and when one order gets held up in drive-thru there 's this <unk> <unk> effect and a lot more orders get held up as well 
 it takes seven minutes for the assistant manager to realize that something weird was going on 
 not the assistant manager handing me the food but the one working on salads 
 who knows how long i could have stood there if she did n't notice 
 what <unk> her in 
 was it the shit-eating grin on my face that was growing larger every moment 
 i will probably never know the answer but people started yelling and it took no time at all for <unk> to be right in my face 
 she asked what the hell i was doing 
 i informed her that i had quit 
 she did n't seem to comprehend what i had said the first time and started bitching so i informed her once again that i quit 
 there was a pause and i added that this customer had been waiting seven minutes for her order so <unk> should probably cover the window 
 i have never seen someone 's face change that many <unk> so quickly 
 she started flipping out 
 why did n't i tell someone 
 i did the grill guy heard me i was just covering this register so that no one could dip into the till 
 it was a completely bs excuse and she knew it 
 i was told to get the <unk> fuck out of my store '' her actual words 
 i went to the crew room to take off my uniform and she screamed now 
 and then she screamed again something <unk> that was probably just a scream of rage 
 everyone had gone dead quiet even the two girls on front cash that always <unk> the night away 
 it was surreal just straight up walking out of the store with my uniform on 
 i went out the side door by the bathrooms 
 going from that hot kitchen to the <unk> <unk> air seemed to <unk> the extreme relief i felt <unk> away from that job and that boss 
 i can not quite explain the sense of <unk> i felt driving out of the parking lot and knowing i never had to come back 
 the aftermath : i had friends on the inside so of course i got all the juicy details on how badly i screwed the place 
 corporate was so furious that they sent a special <unk> team '' to look into things 
 i was expecting some kind of letter in the mail but it never came -- apparently the grill guy hearing me quit and my absolutely bs excuse about <unk> the register were good enough 
 the corporate folks <unk> individual <unk> with every employee that was on that shift to figure out what happened 
 it did n't take long for them to find out that everyone hated <unk> and that <unk> hated everyone back 
 she was transferred to another store in the franchise and fired three months later 
 for the record no co-workers were harmed in this little stunt everyone there hated the place and did n't really care of the paycheck 
 the grill guy thought it was hilarious 
 i never did turn in my <unk> i was young my family did not regularly drink soda 
 only our father had a constant supply and that was specifically for his work lunches 
 of course being greedy kids my sister and i would sneak one from time to time 
 getting rid of the evidence was a problem 
 the sudden appearance of an empty can on the recycling was a dead give away 
 my sister was always drinking far too many of my dad 's sodas and not removing the evidence properly 
 which meant that my parents quickly noticed 
 of course she also never admitted that it was her 
 this led to both of us getting in trouble 
 which is when i hatched my <unk> plan 
 i drank my dad 's soda 
 not too much but enough 
 i would then hide the empty cans in my sister 's closet 
 one day my parents were in her room helping her with something and they opened her closet 
 <unk> right there were multiple empty soda cans 
 caught red handed no one believed her when she swore that she did n't drink them 
 from that time on i was never suspected of drinking my dad 's precious <unk> a park maintenance job one summer 
 i was in my 20s but i was working with mostly teenagers 
 the job was your usual <unk> work -- <unk> mowing removing trash cleaning bathrooms 
 we had a little <unk> <unk> to help move the trash from the bins to the dumpster about half a mile away 
 the park had a lake with a few <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 they were all <unk> tan entitled rich kids 
 they would often make fun of us for our <unk> and <unk> duties or try to steal the cart and they 'd do donuts in the sand with it part of our job was to <unk> the beach <unk> at the end of the day and we had to wait until everyone had left so having more <unk> = longer later hours than we were scheduled for 
 one time the <unk> actually <unk> the cart into a tree and put a huge <unk> in the bed and we were told that we were inches away from getting the cart taken away from us if we could n't respect it 
 <unk> that much trash that far without the cart would be pretty unpleasant so me and my other maintenance buddy started trying to figure out a way to make their lives as difficult as they were making ours 
 the <unk> had two chairs one on each end of the beach maybe 15-20 yards away from each other 
 one of these chairs in particular was their favorite and it was designed in such a way that if there were an <unk> situation you 'd need to jump from the chair rather than climb down it 
 it looked something like this but taller and more like a bench that multiple people could use at once 
 for time <unk> <unk> had employed a huge <unk> of sand under their favorite chair probably around 3 tons so that they could jump into the sand and run down it to the lake 
 the other chair was probably more like what you imagine a regular <unk> chair to look like 
 it was totally fine they just did n't like using it 
 i think they they thought they looked more dramatic <unk> from the chair and running into the water than climbing down like <unk> 
 their favorite chair was also closer to the bathrooms shade etc 
 so one night after the <unk> were done destroying the beach and all the visitors have left my buddy and i grab some shovels and start doing our job -- <unk> the beach 
 totally level 
 between the two of us and the golf cart we make quick work of it -- the <unk> tons of sand was <unk> to an area between the two chairs just far enough away from the favorite chair so that it would be a major pain in the ass to try to move it back by hand 
 we locked up the golf cart but left the maintenance closet open so they could use the shovels <unk> and went home 
 the next day when i arrived at work i could hear the <unk> bitching all the way from the parking lot 
 the male <unk> had his one little shovel and he was <unk> sand up one <unk> at a time walking 10 yards back over to the chair -- losing half of it along the way -- and trying to <unk> the <unk> so they could use their favorite chair instead of the <unk> one 
 where 's the cart '' 
 he was shouting 
 i need it '' 
 yeah buddy ... i know that <unk> live in a nice 3 bedroom <unk> with two other roommates 
 a few nights ago being 20 <unk> a night on the town is <unk> in order 
 i was working the next day at 6am so attending this <unk> with my roommates and friends was out of the question so i stayed home 
 my entire house has walls made out of cardboard i swear 
 you can hear everything no matter where you are 
 using the toilet upstairs 
 yep we can hear it all downstairs 
 every last drop 
 anyways i digress 
 i am <unk> away and of course when everyone roommates and friends and their new friends '' from the bar arrive it is like a god damned <unk> going down main st. it is currently <unk> and i am now wide awake 
 i <unk> the internet for awhile and waited for them to all drunkenly <unk> away 
 house is quiet i sneak slowly down the stairs and start quietly pulling out two large steel pots 
 i can not describe the amount of power i felt standing with my hands over my head two big pots ready to go 
 at the sound of the first explosive <unk> our friend on the couch <unk> straight up like a cartoon character feet flying trying to run 
 he <unk> <unk> and is pointed directly at our sliding screen door 
 as the second <unk> sounds he runs full speed right through the screen door onto the concrete patio yelling <unk> 
 i am now in full swing blasting away walking through the house with the pots 
 i can hear yelling coming from both of the both of the rooms 
 i decide to stop mainly because i am laughing so hard i can barely stand up 
 apparently my male roommate thought someone was breaking in to kill us all and <unk> himself in his bathroom with a baseball bat 
 my female roommate and her friend '' for the night both <unk> out as my <unk> occurred and she accidentally punched him in the mouth 
 i fear for my life for whatever they have planned for me 
 tl : dr i woke up drunk roommates by banging pots and pans at 3am 
 <unk> <unk> few years ago i used to work at a fairly decent <unk> restaurant that served your standard burger fish and chips and <unk> dishes 
 one day a group of four people who looked pretty well to do walked into the restaurant 
 our hostess seated them and i brought over their <unk> and asked if they would like anything to drink while they decided on dinner 
 all 4 demanded extremely specific mixed drinks with multiple extra <unk> on the side and a <unk> dinner for the main course 
 i could tell off the bat this was not going to be a fun table by the tone of their demands 
 i walked over to the bartender with their drink orders and had the drinks made up according to plan 
 before i even made it back to the table to set their drinks down two of the restaurant <unk> request i have the drinks <unk> because they were the wrong shade of color 
 it was at this point my suspicions were confirmed i had a table of class a ass <unk> 
 so begrudgingly i brought the drinks back to the bartender who had a good laugh about it and <unk> '' the drinks 
 a touch of <unk> was all that was changed no petty revenge yet 
 when i brought the drinks back the first two patrons were satisfied but at this point the other two started some complaints about the amount of <unk> in their drinks ... at this point i knew what had to be done as they <unk> about every detail my <unk> is too small get me another '' can we have 4 separate <unk> of bread '' 
 when it came time for the main course of which all 4 had ordered <unk> i accidentally '' left the <unk> sauce cups off the plates on each of their orders 
 good luck eating your <unk> without delicious <unk> sauce 
 i did n't return to their table for a full 15 minutes to make sure the <unk> was good and cold before bringing the <unk> sauce i knew they would ask for 
 i own a wooden shed in my backyard 
 complaint after complaint was filed with the city by my local hoa that my wooden shed was the color of wood 
 $ <unk> in fines later i was required to paint my shed within 72 hours 
 i was so <unk> angry that i went to the hardware store and asked for the <unk> color he could find on his <unk> and this is the result 
 after a few months and seeing the <unk> we changed it to this we now have a sign in the yard that says our house gets painted purple next time '' edit : to those of you mentioning the purple house that was in the south side of <unk> i live in <unk> and that is where i got the idea from 
 and the idea of the threat 
 edit 2 : <unk> mentioned this in the comments but there isnt an actual hoa in my neighborhood what they are is a bunch of older retired folks with nothing else to do so they call the city until our neighborhood inspector comes out to <unk> one of the <unk> of obscure laws at his <unk> so they stop calling <unk> 'm a college girl living in the type of dorm where everybody has their own room but shares a kitchen and a bathroom with several other people 
 in my case i share with six and their friends are always coming in and out of our kitchen 
 somebody or maybe multiple <unk> likes to borrow '' things from our kitchen without asking regardless of who they belong to 
 i 've had several things of mine disappear despite putting my name on everything and sticky notes on the <unk> asking people not to touch things that are n't theirs 
 sometimes i find things again - plates i bought measuring cups once a banana - but sometimes they disappear for good 
 one thing that constantly gets borrowed '' is my salt with my name on it in <unk> sitting right behind a post-it note asking people not to borrow my <unk> without asking first 
 now i have plenty of salt 
 i wo n't miss a few <unk> and i probably wo n't even use all of it before i move out at the end of the semester 
 but it 's the <unk> of it that someone does n't care to ask me before using something that obviously belongs to me 
 i got tired of having to hunt down my salt all the time and finding it sitting in other people 's <unk> and i did n't know exactly who was taking it so i could n't confront them 
 i decided to teach a petty thief a petty lesson 
 i poured my salt into a container marked <unk> '' and filled the salt container up with <unk> soda 
 it does n't look quite like salt but to someone who is n't looking <unk> it 's similar enough 
 it 's not <unk> well not unless you <unk> like <unk> <unk> at once but it tastes pretty bad 
 i put it back in the cabinet and waited 
 unfortunately the end of the story is a bit <unk> 
 my salt disappeared again a few days later but i was patient and whoever took it brought it back soon after this had never happened before 
 it 's been a month and no one has touched it since while i happily just use the salt out of my <unk> '' <unk> 
 i still do n't know who you are salt thief but i like to imagine you had a shitty meal and maybe even learned a <unk> reluctantly went to walmart on black friday <unk> night two weeks ago <unk> to get my parents their first <unk> tv 
 of course it was an absolute zoo from the moment i walked in picture crazy <unk> scene in mean girls <unk> was walking along with all the other normal people when out of nowhere your kids shove me so hard i almost knock over an employee 
 yes you mother of four <unk> your husband and a <unk> filled with toys shrieking at your children in spanish encouraging them to plow through the crowd so they can be the first to grab a <unk> sound bar speaker bar 
 when the employee opened the <unk> ahead of us 
 i was obviously irritated but hey it’s black friday and you have interesting <unk> skills 
 employee and i exchanged apologies and the poor guy just walked away shaking his head 
 20 mins later i turn a corner and actually <unk> you before i see you a few aisles down 
 two of your <unk> spawn sons are <unk> in my direction 
 could it be 
 are they possibly running towards the bin of character pillows ... right next to me 
 i count 2 barbie ones and a few frozen <unk> my eyes settled on the last one ... <unk> 
 oooh <unk> my favorite 
 it really is 
 you shot <unk> at me as i stared back <unk> picked it up and walked towards the cashiers 
 you know how badass it must feel to walk away from an <unk> and not look back 
 that’s exactly what happened except the <unk> was of sound as your <unk> <unk> realized what had happened 
 look at all the dirty stares other shoppers are sending you as you fail to control and console your screaming children 
 guess the entire cart full of toys isn’t as good as having that <unk> pillow which by the way is quite comfortable propped up behind me as i type this out best $ 5 ever spent 
 glorious photo of pillow here : **edit : ** i forgot to mention that my parents who were with me thought it was absurd how much i wanted this pillow i 'm a 24 <unk> old girl 
 i was also flying back home after thanksgiving so this pillow would 've taken up a ton of luggage space so i told myself that i 'd only buy it if it was super cheap ... $ 5 or lower 
 i did n't see any prices listed on the box so i never expected anything of it 
 the second the <unk> scanned and a beautiful $ <unk> came up ... i do n't think i 've ever had a bigger <unk> in my life until that moment 
 **tl dr** costco has way better tv deals for black friday my boyfriend and i were at the grocery store the other day and it was quite busy 
 we had grabbed everything we needed and were waiting in line with about 3 or 4 people ahead of us 
 after a few minutes this woman comes and get in line behind us 
 she is there for no more than 2 minutes before she starts shouting that they need to open another line do n't know how to provide <unk> customer service are incompetent etc 
 she is repeating the same thing over and over and the cashier is visibly uncomfortable 
 bear in mind 4 of the 6 registers are open 
 the store is just very busy 
 she goes on this tirade the entire time i 'm in line 
 i would have just ignored her i used to work in retail so i am good at tuning out assholes but she kept bumping my ankles with her cart as if to accent her point 
 when we got up to the register the cashier noticed that the bag of discount halloween candy we were trying to buy had already been opened and some was missing 
 i 'll be damned if i do n't get the max amount possible of discounted goodness so my boyfriend runs to the back to get another bag 
 at this point i am in front of my cart and the annoying woman behind us is leaning against her cart which is leaning against mine 
 when my boyfriend gets back he politely tries to go around her she can obviously see him but just <unk> herself to wear he ca n't go around 
 so he goes all the way around to get to the register again 
 the woman lets out an exasperated sigh over how long we are taking 
 it is at this point that my boyfriend looks up and realizes how her cart is <unk> on ours 
 he proceeds to <unk> pull our cart forward which in turn causes her cart to fly forward and her to fall flat on her dumb face 
 it took all i had to <unk> laughter and she just stood up all huffy and <unk> 
 she did n't speak another <unk> 'm a college student at a pretty small school <unk> students and as a small school we do n't have too many options when it comes to food 
 we do however have sushi for sale in our main <unk> bar 
 a local sushi restaurant makes a few different types of rolls each morning and sends them over 
 they 're all pretty good but one the <unk> is above and beyond the rest of them 
 my mouth <unk> just thinking about it -- tuna <unk> <unk> shrimp <unk> fish <unk> <unk> and <unk> all rolled together into bites of pure <unk> 
 unfortunately the restaurant only sends over about 4 or 5 of these per day and they sell out fast 
 last week i entered the cafe to get lunch and to my great <unk> i saw there was one <unk> left on the display shelf 
 i grabbed it off the shelf and was walking toward the cash register when a girl came up to me and <unk> oh no i was going for that 
 those are my favorite '' 
 i try to treat others how i 'd like to be treated so i handed it to her and grabbed a few <unk> rolls for myself 
 no big deal 
 the next day i again entered the cafe to see that there was again one <unk> left 
 today was my lucky day 
 i walked toward the shelf just to arrive at the same time as -- guess who 
 -- the girl from the previous day 
 i was reaching for the roll when her hand shot out and grabbed it right from under me 
 i looked at her thinking maybe she did n't recognize me from the previous day but she just smiled and said i love these things '' 
 and <unk> away 
 now i was mad 
 if i went out of my way to be nice to you i expect at least a little decency in return 
 so today when i entered the cafe i was thrilled to see there were three <unk> left 
 i was finally going to get one 
 however when i was <unk> the shelf out of the corner of my eye i saw the same girl enter the cafe and start heading in my direction 
 i sped up a little and reached the shelf about 10 steps ahead of her 
 i grabbed all three <unk> turned around gave her the biggest smile i could muster and said i 'm so hungry today '' 
 the look of disappointment on her face was well worth the $ 25 i spent on sushi 
 i hope she enjoyed her california roll 
 i went into an empty <unk> restaurant one night the fact that it was empty should have told me everything i needed to know and the place was literally owned and run by a mom and pop '' 
 no servers : he cooked she brought it out 
 she had a terrible attitude was slow never refilled drinks turned the tv on with the volume blasting so they could hear it in the kitchen got mad when i asked her to turn it down a little since i could n't even have a conversation with my lady etc 
 the food was crap 
 then to top it off she had the nerve to bring out a bill with a 20 % tip already <unk> into the total 
 <unk> hell <unk> ... ** i crossed out the tip and paid what it should have been and left one penny on the table 
 so yesterday my friends and i spent the day at canada 's <unk> in <unk> 
 there is this one ride called the <unk> which is the <unk> roller <unk> at the park and extremely popular 
 there are 3 trains and when one train takes off another one is done its track 
 so anyways as my train is finished it 's course we pull up into the station behind the other train 
 however some <unk> with a <unk> is giving the employees a hard time 
 he has an arm cast and is not allowed to ride but will not leave the train because he already went on the ride earlier '' 
 no matter how many times the workers told him about <unk> and the danger they would be in he continued to swear and <unk> at the workers with little kids around no less 
 at this point the workers eventually begin to pull him and his friend out but not before the guy spat on every open seat on the roller <unk> 
 at this point he had held up the ride for about 15 minutes and there 's nothing worse than impatient canadian ride warriors 
 best part 
 while he was getting up his phone dropped out of his pocket onto the floor of the <unk> nearly tipping off the edge of the train 
 now my buddy and i who were both front seat in our train and front seat in the action yelled at the employee that his phone was right there 
 the worker went and picked it up held it up for everyone to see and he whole queue line just <unk> and laughed at this <unk> 
 the worker even pretended to drop kick the phone out of the station 
 the worker then went to put it in the lost and found and when our spray tanned <unk> came storming back for his brand new <unk> '' every single person acted like they did n't know what happened 
 of course security comes at this point and <unk> the two out of the park 
 i highly doubt they had a chance to check the lost and found before they left 
 **edit** : since this is starting to take off i feel i should post the <unk> photo from that ride aswell 
 yes that 's me on the <unk> happened years ago and i just stumbled on this subreddit so i figured i would add a story of mine 
 i used to work at a french bakery where each <unk> was in the 2-3 $ range 
 this woman came in one night and was being an <unk> b. she was being rude complaining about the price making me take each <unk> out for her to inspect to make sure it was to her standards 
 i boxed everything up and went to the register 
 she was <unk> cents short i ca n't remember exactly since it was like 6 <unk> ago 
 she told me to just take it from my tip jar since it was such a small amount 
 i looked at her and asked which <unk> she wanted me to put back 
 she stared at me and did n't say anything 
 i think she was shocked that i was n't willing to let it slide 
 she told me to put a <unk> back 
 i did she paid i <unk> her <unk> 
 i could n't stop smiling the rest of the night 
 i took my <unk> daughter to an <unk> <unk> park today <unk> floors lots of those giant <unk> <unk> and slides lots of fun to be had 
 there are two areas one specifically for ages 3 and under and the other for all ages 
 we were pretty <unk> by the number of kids at the <unk> side so we went to the toddler area for some slightly calmer bouncy fun 
 there are only two small <unk> houses in the toddler area and when we walked in there were three young women late <unk> twenties laying in one of them taking up nearly half of the bouncing area staring at their phones and generally being in the way 
 being mostly non-confrontational i stayed my tongue as my daughter bounced around oblivious to the <unk> as she played in the unoccupied half of the <unk> 
 then the most glorious thing happened ... in order to make use of the entire area that was available she decided to just <unk> on these inconsiderate bitches 
 she was happily jumping all around them on top of them grabbing their faces for support all those things that <unk> like to do 
 she let them know that they were in her bouncing zone and if they did n't like it fuck it she was bouncing anyway 
 i said nothing only smiled as all three of them moved to the chairs that are available for adults 
 tl dr : three adults acting like <unk> park themselves in a toddler area used for bouncing get bounced on <unk> live in a gated community 
 the kind where some of the residents think that because they live in a gated community they 're entitled to everything 
 last week on the way home from work i was in the left hand turn lane waiting on an suv to turn right so i could complete my turn 
 this lady slowed way way down and took her <unk> time making the turn 
 of course oncoming traffic has the right of way so i waited for her to turn in 
 now for the revenge 
 when she got to the gate she stopped and waited for me to get my <unk> out to open it for her 
 so i just stopped behind her 
 through her mirrors & amp windows i saw her <unk> and then pick up her purse and start digging through it 
 as soon as i saw her arm to come up to open the gate i used my remote and opened it for her 
 take that my gf decided to pick on me during family <unk> to make me react 
 instead once we watched a movie together i changed the volume from time to time to odd numbers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the sound became too loud or too soft so she does n't get the satisfaction of round and even numbers 
 she complained about the odd number every time i did it 
 take that in my old workplace we did n't technically have assigned seats but it was an <unk> rule that you stayed in the same place 
 when your job is as mundane as being told to fuck off and die by 200 strangers a day it 's the little things that get you through <unk> 
 so when some fucker comes in and steals my seat like he owns the fucking place and then very <unk> refuses to move this pissed me off 
 there 's two types of <unk> in a call centre : ones with <unk> ear pads and ones with <unk> ear pads 
 he had the latter 
 so while the call centre when on break i stayed behind and took my blue permanent marker and proceeded to colour in the ears of his headset 
 now because of the <unk> the ink takes a minute to dry especially as i 'd really saturated it on there 
 <unk> asshole returns from his break and <unk> his headset <unk> <unk> himself in the process 
 the beautiful part is that he only found out about his blue ears when he went to the work <unk> and the server informed him and called for her colleagues to come have a look at the <unk> fella '' this was also <unk> <unk> i had gotten so much ink on his headset that even after he thought it was clean he ended up with blue ears the next day too 
 tl dr some guy took my seat in work so i gave him blue <unk> night i took my ex girlfriend to the hospital for the fourth time in 3 weeks 
 every time we have missed her appointment because she took so long to get ready she made us late 
 we were <unk> on the ride back and i decided i had enough of her bullshit after she pushed my last button 
 i pulled over and told her that she needed to <unk> of my car 
 i hopped out put her groceries and junk food onto the pavement of the driveway i had pulled into and hopped back in 
 she dumped her entire soda on the floor board of my car as she exited trying to be a massive bitch 
 in response i carefully backed up to make sure i would run over the bag filled with snack cakes and chips and yelled for her to go fuck herself as i pulled out and drove off 
 edit : because people are confused about our relationship status for some <unk> got married a couple of years ago and we booked a 5 night stay at a great resort in <unk> for our <unk> 
 we flew out of st. <unk> the day after the wedding change planes in <unk> and then on to <unk> 
 or at least that was what was supposed to happen 
 **the <unk> for some reason <unk> <unk> was entirely unable to figure out how to get an airplane from st. <unk> to <unk> 
 there were three or four flights that afternoon and every single one of them was delayed all for mechanical reasons 
 by the time we got to <unk> the last flight to <unk> for the day had already left so we had to spend the first night of our <unk> in a best western instead of the all <unk> resort i had shelled out for 
 **the <unk> since we 're on our <unk> we decide that we 'd like to sit down and have an actual meal in the airport instead of just grabbing a sandwich so we went to the only actual <unk> restaurant in the <unk> area of the airport it was one of those <unk> <unk> 's knock <unk> 
 we get a table and then i actually take a good look at the meal <unk> the airline gave us 
 two <unk> each worth $ 6 for a total of $ 12 for the two of us 
 the cheapest thing on the menu at the restaurant was $ 10 
 so i was mad 
 instead of being on a <unk> beach with my new bride i was stuck in the airport in <unk> and the airline would n't even buy us a decent meal 
 so i went back to the ticket counter to complain 
 i was n't rude i was n't obnoxious but i was <unk> 
 i told the attendant that the <unk> were n't even worth enough to buy a plate of <unk> and asked him what they could do about it 
 the attendant looked sympathetic and told me he would go talk to his supervisor to see what he could do 
 <unk> 1** so i waited 
 he was gone for almost 15 minutes 
 i was starting to think that he had either forgotten about me or was avoiding dealing with me when he came back with something in his hand 
 first he gave me two travel <unk> worth $ 100 each for future <unk> flights 
 then he handed me a whole <unk> of meal <unk> 25 of them each worth $ 6 
 i thanked the man profusely for his help and returned to the restaurant feeling <unk> 
 <unk> 2** meanwhile my wife had been chatting with the waiter in the restaurant and told him about the delay in our <unk> and how disappointed she was she had never left the us before so flying to <unk> was a pretty big deal even without the <unk> 
 i returned we ordered and ate and then gave the <unk> to the waiter to settle the check 
 when he returned he told us that in addition to the food he had gone ahead and put our drinks on the <unk> as well which he was n't really supposed to do 
 so the entire meal plus drinks was free 
 i gave him a *really* good tip cash of course not <unk> 
 **the revenge** so at some point i started reading the <unk> carefully 
 i 'm not a lawyer but i am pretty good at understanding <unk> and i made two <unk> 
 first the <unk> expired in three days so if we did n't use them before we took off in the morning we would n't be able to use them at all 
 second nowhere on the <unk> did it say <unk> '' 
 when we got to the airport in the morning we got ourselves some coffee and muffins 
 after we ate we still had 10 or 12 of the <unk> left 
 so i started handing them out 
 i 'd go up to people ask them if they 'd had anything to eat yet today and if they said no i handed them a <unk> and told them to go buy breakfast <unk> 's paying '' 
 if they had kids i gave them 2. i kept at it until i was out of <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> on the way back to the us from <unk> i attempted to use the travel <unk> to <unk> us to first class 
 the woman at the counter had to call the airline office in order to redeem the <unk> but she was unable to get through to them 
 she upgraded us anyway because we had attempted to pay for it '' and let us keep the <unk> 
 tl dr <unk> get a <unk> 
 and <unk> get a <unk> 
 and <unk> get a <unk> ... 
 edit : to the <unk> - yeah after many <unk> employees i found one guy who actually treated me like a human being 
 i took advantage of his <unk> and used $ 60 of a large <unk> 's <unk> capital to make several other people happy 
 i 'm a horrible <unk> live in a pretty friendly area 
 we know and like all of our neighbors 
 almost everyone has a dog or two and we let them play in the giant park across the street as sort of an <unk> dog park 
 my bf has the morning shift of <unk> in the park and on his way home some random lady 50 yards away starts screaming about the dogs being off leash she 's gon na follow them home and call animal control '' 
 bf shrugs it off and heads inside 
 i 'm just waking up i sleep in the <unk> 
 he 's telling me about the park lady when he looks out the window sure as shit she 's outside our house and on the phone 
 so i did what any <unk> would do at 9am waking up to some lady standing in my driveway 
 i opened the <unk> and waved at her 
 <unk> my coffee and <unk> the day 
 hi neighbor 
 her jaw drops she turned immediately and walked away 
 fast 
 bf trucks behind her just following you home in case i need to make a report '' animal control never came by 
 hopefully that neighbor learned to mind her own <unk> was behind him 
 i was beside him in the left turn lane 
 his light turned green and i looked over at him 
 still on his phone 
 now i could honk but he should n't be on his phone and with no cars behind him he 's only wasting his own time 
 he looks up to see ... a yellow light 
 he looks over at me and sees i just watched the whole thing and i shrug 
 he shrugs too and puts his damn phone away 
 man i got him so good 
 he probably arrived like two minutes later than he was going to 
 petty never felt so <unk> morning i was put on road guard 
 basically i stand at the entrance to the road and prevent cars from running over <unk> <unk> physical fitness training 
 this is somewhat <unk> because there are a few <unk> buildings along this road where <unk> have to check in to work during physical training time 
 normally we just <unk> the traffic to a safer route 
 today there was a guy who just couldnt listen 
 ol boy pulled up at my intersection and i asked him where he was going 
 <unk> farm he says 
 'sorry sir <unk> have to flip a u turn and get there by <unk> street actually if you cut through that parking lot back <unk> <unk> i take this road *every <unk> 
 'sorry sir this is friday not every day and the road is closed to all vehicles 
 <unk> have to turn around <unk> no he says <unk> going this way i got a little angry <unk> that way sir and ill call the <unk> <unk> military police <unk> the <unk> then i dont care 
 at this he stomped on his <unk> drove onto the closed road and sped off <unk> avoiding several <unk> 
 now i like to be known as a man of my word 
 since he told me where he worked i drove up there after physical training hours and snapped a pic of his plates 
 i called the <unk> and theyre on their way to take my statement 
 with any luck at all hell be heavily ticketed and possibly banned from ever driving on <unk> <unk> again 
 update : <unk> took my statement and the statements of a few of the <unk> almost struck and suspended <unk> <unk> driving clearance he cant drive it on base anymore 
 edit : removed <unk> comment that <unk> relevant to the <unk> work in a deli 
 im usually a passive <unk> bitch to rude customers 
 you know the kind 
 dont say please 
 ill <unk> your <unk> flat as a pancake as i wrap it up 
 just point and say give me this '' 
 i will grab everything except for what youre pointing at to waste your time 
 demand something cut fresh even though you just saw me cut it and put it in the case 
 ill tell you there is none left out the back to cut 
 but today i decided to take it to a new level 
 every rude customer i had i told them have a lovely <unk> '' instead of have a nice day '' 
 yeah thats right bitches 
 you only get to have a nice part of the day 
 i hope the rest of it is horrible and you have to eat a bag of dicks or something 
 <unk> 
 take <unk> background : i 'm 15 and i have had this one friend- you know the <unk> i only really hung out with because i 'd known him since i was 8 or so 
 the dude was immature dumb and extremely <unk> religious 
 i still kinda felt like i had to hang out with him though and this past weekend i did a <unk> stream event the <unk> <unk> where we raised money to send video games to <unk> and i needed someone to do it with me and he was the only one available 
 so the weekend rolls around and he comes over 
 he does n't actually have any games for his <unk> he 's just played my <unk> 3 and grand theft auto <unk> he downloaded off my account since he got it 
 so against my best judgment i invite him to help me out with the stream and the first while goes pretty well 
 we alternate between <unk> and <unk> 's mod with him on my spare laptop 
 so we 're 18 or 19 hours in it 's around 7am and we 're <unk> <unk> when he decides to play as a police officer and sit in the spawn point killing people at random which is against the rules of the game and can get you banned 
 i tell him to stop seeing as it was my account and he was going to get it banned and sure enough he kept going and got that account banned from the server 
 he expected me to take his side and get him <unk> from the server and when i refused because it was his own fault he literally started crying and telling me you 're a real asshole '' 
 he called his mother at 7:30 in the morning and packed his shit and left with 5 hours left in the stream 
 this left me falling asleep with nobody to talk to to stream games alone 
 i ended up falling asleep and having to cut the stream short by three hours 
 he 's sixteen 
 turning <unk> shortly 
 and he 's literally fucking crying over a video game because he got banned for breaking the rules after a lot of <unk> 
 and since then him and his friends have been harassing me at school 
 ca n't let that happen 
 further background on him he 's lazy and has n't attempted to get a job and his mom is really religious and wo n't let him buy mature rated games 
 i 'm the only reason he has the two he had 
 so today i went on my <unk> account and <unk> all the <unk> except for mine so he can no longer play any of my games 
 immature and petty 
 probably 
 who cares 
 enjoy your $ 300 <unk> <unk> i used to work at a well-known coffee chain inside a grocery store and we had a new practice put in place : if you do n't receive a receipt from us you get your money back 
 yeah 
 this is a thing 
 since lots of people just do n't want a receipt from a $ 3 purchase i got into the habit of <unk> all receipts on the counter 
 customer could take it if they wanted it and if not i 'd toss it 
 so one day this lady comes in orders a medium hot coffee and a coffee roll 
 i ring her up and she immediately starts complaining about the price 
 i tell her sorry coffee rolls cost more than donuts and i do n't make the prices 
 i put the change in her hand and the receipt on the counter but make note of the fact that she 's reading our little receipt or your money back '' sign 
 about 45 minutes later i 'm in the way back of the store and my coworker pages me back 
 i come <unk> thinking there 's a huge line of people but it 's just that lady from earlier claiming she did n't get a receipt and she wants her refund 
 well i knew for a fact that i laid it on the counter 
 my coworker has already gone through all of our trash bins and could n't find it 
 on a <unk> i went to a nearby trash bin at the store 's pharmacy 
 i dig through some papers <unk> <unk> and <unk> donuts and find the receipt which she 'd clearly taken and thrown out herself and hold it out for her to take 
 that 's not my receipt '' 
 ma'am i remember your order 
 you ordered a medium coffee and a coffee roll which i remember because you did n't like the price of the coffee roll 
 we got 12 coffee rolls today - 6 plain 6 <unk> 
 i know this because i 've been here since 5:30 this morning when i <unk> them myself 
 we now have 5 plain 6 <unk> 
 this is your receipt which somehow <unk> to the trash on your side of the counter despite your never having received it 
 i 'm sure it was just an <unk> 
 have a nice day '' 
 and i handed her that <unk> <unk> receipt and walked away like a <unk> riding into the <unk> 
 tl dr : woman did n't like our prices tried to get an <unk> refund 
 proved her wrong and handed her her disgusting <unk> i 'm driving home from work on a relatively short commute 
 this particular stretch of road is usually a speed trap and a school zone 
 i drive up no surprise there 's a cop waiting on a side road but i 'm going the speed limit 
 no worries 
 i had to go home and get my 2 year old daughter then go back toward the way i came to go to her friend 's <unk> i knew to go the speed limit since you know school <unk> trap 
 cue the huge truck tailgating me because i 'm going the speed limit 
 i knew this was my time to shine 
 he 's swerving all over the road looking for his way to get around me 
 as we approach where i know the cop is waiting i slow down to a few <unk> below the limit 
 he angrily speeds into the lane of oncoming traffic perfectly in front of mr. police officer 
 seconds later i <unk> away as the <unk> go off and he faces i hope at least a few tickets 
 after i dropped my daughter off i drove home and he was still there with the cop 
 i would n't quite say he was crying but he looked down right miserable 
 <unk> <unk> i was in high school i worked part time at <unk> lobby in my small texas town 
 we had an egregious amount of <unk> inventory with a <unk> of 300 % 
 therefore we were always having some ridiculous sell <unk> % off <unk> <unk> or <unk> % off wooden picture <unk> the sale items were usually so unique that the <unk> didn’t amount to a lot 
 and during the week our customer basis consisted of bored coupon <unk> <unk> 
 so it’s a typical saturday and i’ve got the evening shift 
 the store is <unk> packed with <unk> wanting to spend their money on cheap <unk> house <unk> and <unk> supplies 
 i’m on the cashier when i have the pleasure of checking out this woman - whom we shall refer to as <unk> 
 so <unk> starts <unk> all her disgusting <unk> <unk> down on my conveyor 
 i begin <unk> the prices one by one we didn’t have <unk> 
 as i proceed to bag them she hastily roars <unk> want them all wrapped 
 they <unk> to be <unk> fine i’ll wrap your wooden <unk> and plastic bird <unk> 
 no big deal i get these type of <unk> in my line all the <unk> 
 i continue ringing up the rest of her items 
 as i finish she presents me with about 7 stupid coupons for 5 % off this and 10 % off that no surprise that this <unk> beast is a penny <unk> 
 she eyes me <unk> as i apply them one by one 
 i total up her order and politely ask her <unk> or credit ” when she practically has a meltdown 
 <unk> <unk> be right 
 did you enter all the coupons 
 i don’t think you rang up all the <unk> “ma’am this is correct 
 i rang up all the <unk> <unk> takes a moment of <unk> silence before i <unk> 
 <unk> you like for me to ring them up again ” <unk> ” she <unk> while practically stomping her feet with frustration 
 this is where the petty revenge comes in 
 you see when i was ringing up her items the first time around i accidentally bagged one of items before ringing it up 
 and out of pure laziness i didn’t bother trying to find the item <unk> it and ring it up 
 which would have saved her around $ 20 
 but no she had to be a cunt 
 so i <unk> everything packed it in the little brown paper just like she <unk> carefully entered all 7 of her coupons and told her the new amount 
 upon seeing the new much higher total she gave me a confused look and i gleefully announced <unk> my <unk> i guess i originally hadn’t included your set of <unk> <unk> eggs 
 good thing we <unk> everything back up ” her expression fell in an instant and i could see the regret flash across her face 
 hope it was worth the 2 dollars you were trying to save : tl : dr i forgot to ring something up after i bagged it and was too lazy to get it out of the bag to ring it up 
 lady gets <unk> about the final price of her transaction saying it’s too high 
 she insists i didn’t properly enter her coupons and makes me <unk> her entire order 
 the new and correct price is higher thanks to my original laziness 
 i smile as regret flashes across her face upon realizing what just happened 
 edit : so many errors so about a week ago this car came out of nowhere and cut me off i was pretty annoyed but figured they would speed up in front of me 
 i guess they got upset i was riding their ass maybe 3-4 <unk> you just cut me off 
 and hit their brakes causing me to slam on mine 
 i was so angry i actually looked up their <unk> license plate and found the owner 's name through an online forum special car 
 i found out where they worked and considered writing a letter to leave on their car so maybe they would get a little freaked <unk> harmless but i did n't follow through with it 
 fast forward to today and imagine my surprise when i find their car parked in my private lot i could n't help myself and called the tow truck company to have it towed 
 it 's a small world do n't drive like an asshole especially when you have such a <unk> car when i lived in college i rented a tiny house behind a larger house 
 they had a large parking area that could fit 3-4 cars next to the driveway 
 the only way for me to drive back to my house was a shared driveway 
 the front house was occupied by some frat brothers who loved to have people over 
 which was fine except instead of asking people to park on the street or down the street depending on party size they would park in the driveway blocking my access 
 sometimes i 'd just park in the street and walk back to my house which just stoked my <unk> 
 but most annoying was when i would wake up to being blocked in 
 i 'd have to bang on their door for several minutes to get someone to answer and move the offending vehicle typically making me late to class 
 one night i get home late around 1 am and there are three cars in the driveway 
 and i have had enough 
 there was just enough room for me to squeeze into the driveway inches from the back bumper of the last truck 
 this meant i was blocking in those three cars as well as all but one in the parking area 
 and the one that was n't blocked would have to do some serious <unk> to get out 
 i took the long walk back to my house planning what snide and ugly thing i might say the next day 
 <unk> the next day when they 'd be forced to <unk> back to my house and ask me to <unk> them 
 i intended to take my sweet time answering the door 
 i woke up the next day about 1 pm and no one had come 
 they had maneuvered all those cars around no telling how long it took leaving only my car in the driveway rather than come get me 
 that was even more satisfying to me than if they 'd come to get me 
 for the next six months i lived there they never once blocked me in again 
 so my apartment complex parking lot is a <unk> land where people park in each others spots semi regularly and so every once in a while someone parks in my spot 
 i used to just leave a note that said we pay for this spot please do n't park here '' but i 'm sick and tired of that shit so i 've taken to just <unk> them by putting random gross stuff on their <unk> 
 today almost every single spot in the whole lot was empty besides mine which had a white camry in it 
 and i do not own a white camry 
 i snap call walk back into my apartment and pick up my bottle of pancake syrup and my <unk> and cover that assholes windshield 
 not two hours later i 'm getting back home and i see a woman cleaning the windshield 
 so i just waved and said hello and the woman says hello back 
 then i say hey that 's my spot by the way '' 
 and she gets this <unk> look on her face 
 oh ... sorry '' that 's fine '' 
 i turn around and walk into my apartment 
 i like to think she still does n't know whether i did it or not 
 was just reminded of this and thought it <unk> here : so a while ago i 'm working at the front desk of a hotel 
 it 's a couple hours before check-in but people check in early all the time 
 if we happen to have a clean room we 'll get you in there if not we get all your info take your luggage and give you a call as soon as your room is ready 
 so on this day we had a convention in 
 convention people generally get in early drop off their luggage go to the convention and grab the keys for their room when the day ends around 5. not this woman 
 she 'd tried to check in at 10 am got annoyed that her room was n't ready and then proceeded to check back once or twice an hour 
 each time she asked myself or my co-worker would tell her we 'll call you when it 's ready '' 
 she comes up again her 10th or so visit to the front desk says there has to be one clean room by now '' and at this point i was willing to bend my do n't reward bad behavior '' policy and <unk> her into whatever room was available just to get her out of my face 
 we had <unk> the convention rate rooms by a few rooms anyway low floor views blocked by other buildings usually not as quiet because of street noises so we were going to have to <unk> a couple of people anyway so i thought : fuck it 
 she 's huffing and puffing about how long she 's waited and surely there is a clean room by now and i check the computer 
 there is fabulous corner room a bit bigger with massive windows on two side on a high floor with a spectacular view 
 it 's one of our coveted rooms but it 's available and i 'll turn an unhappy guest into a happy one and everyone wins 
 so i tell her actually you 're right 
 we do have an available room and ... '' before i can finish she throws her purse on the counter 
 my room is ready 
 i have been waiting here for hours 
 why did n't anyone call me 
 you said you would call '' 
 and i say well yes we did say we would call but ... '' but nothing 
 do you know how long i have been waiting 
 i have checked back and you people said you would call '' 
 but ma'am let me explain ... '' <unk> 
 you said you would <unk> '' 
 it went like this for a bit me trying to tell her what happened but she would not let me explain 
 she kept <unk> you said you would <unk> over and over 
 now i was pissed that i had even tried to help this woman out 
 i just wanted her to shut up and leave 
 so i pull a trick i 've used before 
 ma'am we did try to call you 
 is your phone number <unk> '' 
 i tell her a number that is one number off of her real number they usually say oh ok simple mistake my real number is <unk> i apologize for the mix up buy them a round of drinks at the bar and everyone is happy 
 not this woman 
 yes that 's my number 
 i never got a call '' 
 i was confused 
 did she <unk> me 
 so i repeat the wrong number again being sure to <unk> each number so she could see what had not really happened 
 again she claimed loudly that that was her number and this time she said her room should be free because we are idiots who made her wait for hours because we could n't make a simple phone call 
 my manager is <unk> around the corner actually laughing at me and i am now <unk> 
 she wants free stuff and is not going to back down 
 she called my <unk> 
 suddenly it dawns on me 
 ma'am do you have your phone on you 
 could the ringer be off '' 
 she said it 's on is still screaming 
 so i say and the number is <unk> right 
 we let me just call it and see what the issue is '' 
 now her face freezes as she realizes that she just painted herself into a corner 
 i call the fake number and not <unk> her phone does n't ring 
 as i 'm still on the phone i say <unk> is it ringing 
 it 's ringing on my end 
 could you check it 
 maybe you have some missed calls '' 
 she does n't answer just picks up her purse and asks <unk> for her room key 
 this is the first time since i told her her room was ready that she has n't yelled 
 but now i 'm pissed and i am not about to let her have this room 
 instead i find one of the dreaded 25 '' rooms 
 these are rooms that we never give out unless we are sold out they are right next to the elevator they are tiny they have no desk and they do n't even have <unk> 
 just little <unk> 
 they 're being eliminated during the next <unk> too so they still have all of the old <unk> alarm clocks and <unk> bathrooms 
 because no one uses them they are usually clean 
 so i book her into this room smile brightly as i hand her the key and wish her a happy stay 
 <unk> : of course she called down ten minutes later irate again and i let my manager take the call 
 he told her that if she 'd like to move she could certainly do that but she would have to wait until after check-in and he would see what we had available then 
 she never bothered calling back 
 just discovered this <unk> awesome sub and figured this story was worth <unk> - i had originally told this tale in a comment on another sub a few weeks back 
 when i was <unk> i worked at a local video rental place 
 it was <unk> owned and was <unk> as hell - pretty sure the owner used it as a front for something shady but that 's neither here nor there 
 the boss was too cheap to pay more than one person per shift so i had the slow <unk> night shifts all to myself 
 we were in this <unk> rich <unk> town <unk> <unk> and 90 % of our business consisted of local soccer moms bringing their kids in for a movie night 
 most of these women were terrible people - <unk> to their spoiled <unk> who would throw credit cards around without thinking twice and would <unk> everyone they <unk> beneath '' them 
 we had a very basic computer system at the time and there was a <unk> function that would n't allow someone to rent another movie if they had over $ 10 of late fees on their account 
 the employees had the ability to <unk> this at their <unk> or to lower the fees if they thought it appropriate 
 generally speaking i was the guy who would waive any & amp all late fees - reason being that my boss was a cheap fuck and i did n't worry at all about making money for him ... if the customer was nice to me i 'd waive their fees no questions asked 
 anyway ... one day this woman comes in with a bunch of kids if i remember correctly it was 5-6 roughly <unk> year old boys 
 the kids were running around pulling things off the shelves making lots of noise punching each other pissing off other customers and pissing me off as well 
 the woman did n't do shit about it she sat there <unk> on her cellphone not <unk> about the scene her kids were causing 
 being a fairly <unk> & amp non-confrontational person by nature i did n't say anything and just figured i 'd clean up the mess when they left 
 so the woman finally comes up to the counter with like 8 different movies a few video games and a bunch of candy 
 she 's standing there on the phone still shoves the stuff at me across the counter and does n't even acknowledge my presence 
 so i look up her account ... boom 
 $ 120 worth of late fees and four titles rented for <unk> months and still not returned 
 so i tried getting her attention saying something like excuse me ma'am ... ma'am '' 
 while her back is turned 
 she gestures me off 
 so i stand there and do nothing waiting 
 she finally hangs up a minute or so later turns to me and says something snarky like well what 's taking so long '' 
 so i explain ma'am you have a very <unk> fee on your account and i ca n't let you rent any more movies until this is paid and the missing movies are returned '' 
 she flips a shit 
 starts ranting that her daughter <unk> things in her name never returns anything does n't pay fees and that she herself has done no wrong and the fees should be cleared and she should be able to rent etc etc 
 i nod but say this account still owes $ 120 and i ca n't allow you to rent until it 's paid 
 company policy ma'am i 'm sorry but i do n't make the rules '' 
 she starts going off again saying ridiculous things like i know the owner he 'll wipe out the debt in a <unk> you 'd better let me rent or i 'll complain to him about how terrible his employees are and you 'll be <unk> '' etc etc 
 i tell her he 's out of the country which was true and ca n't be reached not true and she still owes $ 120 getting <unk> by the second 
 she bitches some more and finally pulls out the card 
 we had this ancient machine that for reasons <unk> to me would only read a magnetic strip correctly if you wrapped the card in a plastic grocery bag 
 i could n't explain to you why but it was the only way the damn thing worked 
 so as you can probably guess i ran the card with no plastic wrap 
 denied 
 tried it again just for looks ... denied 
 i printed out a receipt and asked if she had cash 
 she did n't and she was <unk> about the card 
 i showed her the receipt saying card not accepted '' and <unk> <unk> 
 she asked er violently demanded that she speak to a manager 
 i happily informed her that i was the manager on duty and was indeed the only employee in the store 
 she stormed out and walked across the street to the bank ... came back a few minutes later with the money and practically threw it at me 
 i took the payment ... and said now about those <unk> movies ... i do n't suppose your daughter would like to return them for you so you can rent these movies '' 
 i got the worst death glare i think i 've ever received and my mother can practically shoot lasers from her eyes and the woman abandoned her stack of movies and stomped out 
 not sure if we ever saw her again but at the time 15 year old me was so proud of myself for staying cool under pressure and fucking with this woman 
 and seriously ... fuck <unk> soccer moms **tl dr - worked at a video rental store got revenge on a rude soccer <unk> with <unk> late fees and <unk> <unk> edit : broke it into <unk> for ease of <unk> 've just started playing black <unk> 2 on my nephew 's old xbox live account 
 i 'm a girl not very good but it 's hella fun so i 've been playing a lot recently 
 gotten a bit better though my <unk> ratio is around <unk> so hey i 'm happy if i break even 
 i was playing a gun game for the first time and as soon as i first said something on the mic and my female voice is heard this guy asshole immediately lays into me calling me a dirty cunt '' loose pussy '' and reminding me to get back to the kitchen but not before sucking his cock 
 what a douchey loser 
 i 'm just trying to play games and have a good time 
 however i did not reply to his shit talk 
 i mute the mic and hand the <unk> to my nephew who is quite good 
 and gun game is his <unk> 
 i suggest we fuck this asshole guy up a little and my nephew is all for it 
 i stay on the mic 
 every man for himself my nephew won the game led the lobby in <unk> and had the <unk> <unk> ratio 
 asshole goes off again talking shit saying i could n't do it again 
 i turn on the mic and then say okay let 's do this again '' 
 asshole talks shit non-stop the entire game 
 i do not say a word 
 again my nephew tops the lobby and wins 
 asshole then calls me a cheating whore etc 
 etc 
 do it again 
 okay let 's do this again '' 
 more non-stop shit talk 
 my nephew <unk> him a third time 
 more shit talk 
 i sigh into the mic 
 <unk> 
 * okay '' 
 after beating him a fourth time asshole is angry 
 others in the lobby are telling him to shut up at this point but he wo n't 
 he 's going to run this into the ground 
 hey op you could n't fucking beat me in <unk> '' 
 okay '' i say 
 i have n't said much of anything at this point and it 's pissing him off that i 'm not replying 
 i do n't need to reply the score does the <unk> for me 
 we get into a <unk> game and again my nephew <unk> him 
 bullshit '' 
 he cries one game is n't fair 
 2 out of 3 '' 
 sweetie '' i sigh are you done yet '' 
 he <unk> 
 sweet <unk> <unk> has a few <unk> which is obviously nice when multiple people need to warm something up at the same time 
 but usually there is still a small line of people waiting for the next available microwave
