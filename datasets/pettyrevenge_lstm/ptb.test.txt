 while i was waiting my turn for a microwave a <unk> comes and ignores the line and tries to take the next microwave before the person in front of me 
 he gets talked down and convinced to wait like everyone else 
 as my turn comes and my food is warming up i notice that the <unk> is the next in line and my microwave will be available before the others 
 so having learned of the mute button on the microwave just a few days previously i turned the <unk> off as i casually remove my food 
 i sit close enough to see my <unk> put his food in the microwave and then pull out his phone while he waits ... and waits ... and waits 
 he was so absorbed in his phone that he did n't notice that his microwave had stopped almost 2 minutes ago 
 by the time he noticed and tested his food it was already <unk> and had to <unk> it a little longer 
 i did n't think it would work because i figured he would notice the <unk> of the microwave stopping even without the beep 
 guess not 
 so a really petty story but it made me smile 
 tl dr : impatient <unk> tries to use microwave has to wait instead 
 gets a mute microwave and his food gets cold 
 during college i worked nights at a general convenience store 
 there was a pharmacy toiletries snacks etc 
 basically everything but groceries 
 we also sent out a <unk> <unk> replete with coupons <unk> people of current sales and whatnot 
 an elderly woman used to come in and buy ~ $ 300 worth of things on sale then come back a week later with those deals now <unk> and return them only to claim that she no longer had the receipt 
 without the receipt we have to give her the full price 
 so in short she would spend $ 300 on sale items then return them at full price a week later to get $ <unk> 
 it was store credit and not cash but still ... so after a few months i realize what she 's doing 
 she comes in to buy her stuff and i even tell her : i know what you 're doing 
 do n't come back a week from now and return these ok '' 
 so she nods <unk> <unk> and buys all of her stuff 
 a week later she comes back in to return everything 
 she does n't recognize me and i do n't say anything this time 
 i ring up each of her items and instead of <unk> the transaction and <unk> a few hundred dollars onto her gift card i cancel the transaction and give her an empty gift card and a receipt with the canceled items on it 
 upon close <unk> she might have noticed the details and how the transaction was cancelled but she does n't 
 instead she comes in a few days later complaining about how her gift card does n't work 
 this time she <unk> recognize me 
 i smile politely and retrieve my manager telling him how this lady is trying to screw us and how i fucked her shit up 
 he laughed his ass off and kicked her out of the store telling her to never come back 
 edit : to those of you who do n't believe <unk> i could n't give a shit 
 to those of you who think i did something <unk> you 're right 
 i <unk> petty <unk> and she <unk> return <unk> 
 to those of you who think i did something morally <unk> who cares 
 eye of the <unk> <unk> 
 she stole hundreds if not thousands from the store and i took back a few of those hundreds 
 i assure you that the store did n't break even 
 and perhaps i should have made this clear from the get go -- i personally made no <unk> from any of these <unk> i was driving to work a man began riding my ass 
 it was a a 35 <unk> speed limit and i was pushing <unk> he was right on my bumper for almost twenty minutes 
 me <unk> people like this look for some revenge 
 i found it when a <unk> went red and i suddenly stopped 
 <unk> was drinking coffee and tailgating and his drink went all over him 
 through my rearview i can see him losing his shit 
 he attempts to get out of his car and when he does presumably to berate me the light turns green 
 i speed away 
 goodbye asshole 
 so we went to a new hot spot for sunday <unk> 
 stood around waiting for a friend and ended up <unk> <unk> with an older couple who were waiting on their family 
 my friend finally shows and my wife has <unk> a nice table next to the window the people we were talking to and their extended family grab the next one over 
 i walk over in order to double check my wife 's order to find the people at the next table over <unk> all the dirty dishes left by the previous patrons at their table on our table 
 my wife grabs them and hands them back and i say i have a friend sitting there please do n't treat our table like a trash can '' 
 i walk away assuming it 's resolved 
 oh no 
 the second i left apparently a couple of guys from the next table walk over and announce to my wife we 're taking this table too '' 
 the dirty dishes come back and then the women start piling their purses on our table 
 the last one is tossed over and lands in front of my wife 
 she said this purse is so close she could n't put her phone down 
 as i 've mentioned before my wife spent more than 10 years as a wedding <unk> 
 she 's used to dealing with high entitlement people 
 she grabbed a couple of purses turned around to people standing behind her and handed them to the <unk> men standing there 
 these guys were n't part of the party they were just waiting on a table themselves 
 she said i know guys are used to being on purse <unk> and they took them without question '' 
 suddenly there is a mad rush from the other table to <unk> their belongings 
 she takes the purse in front of her stacks it onto the dirty dishes and hands the entire thing to the <unk> we 'd talked to in line 
 as is typical with my wife she only mentioned it after the fact 
 she said i figured if i called you back things would have really escalated '' 
 lol

 okay so this happened sometime last year 
 a few fraternity brothers they 're cousins invited me to one of their friend 's birthday dinners 
 it was a nice place 
 it had great food had a great time 
 on the ride back one of them let 's call him simon said hey <unk> did you forget something at the restaurant '' 
 no i do n't think so '' 
 all of a sudden he pulled out my wallet 
 apparently i had left my wallet which was stupid on my part at the restaurant and thankfully he grabbed it before we headed out 
 oh thanks man i really <unk> '' <unk> <unk> 
 i found this wallet do n't i get a reward or something '' 
 uh ... how bout a <unk> you '' 
 nope that ai n't gon na cut it '' 
 wtf 
 now given i screwed up and was grateful that someone did grab it rather than me forgetting it call the restaurant before it closed and then having to drive back on my own time to pick it up 
 but this is bullshit 
 simon seriously i 'd like to have my wallet back 
 it was my old man 's '' 
 dad passed a couple of years ago due to <unk> <unk> cancer i do n't give a f*** '' 
 this was big <unk> for me 
 you can call me names and pull pranks on me that 's fine 
 i 've done it to him too and we all take it in <unk> was not okay with it when i first joined the fraternity 
 but when you do n't give back something to it 's <unk> owner especially when it they have <unk> value over it that 's a line that should n't be crossed 
 after a <unk> of threats <unk> etc 
 he said i had to pay him $ 20 at a wedding of another fraternity brother 's that was coming up in two weeks 
 i got my wallet back but i was <unk> ... i thought of ways i could get back to him 
 sure i wanted to beat the living <unk> out of him but that would have been too much 
 i 've never had the opportunity to come up with any revenge scheme ... but then it hit me 
 if he wants his $ 20 i 'll give him his $ 20 
 even if it was messed up i was a man and i will meet up to my end of the <unk> 
 so on the drive over i went into a bank with a $ 20 in my hand 
 as i got to the teller i asked for $ 20 in pennies 
 the teller gave me a weird look at first 
 i told him it was for a project for my <unk> class 
 he just shrugged and said oh cool '' 
 i had to make some bs story on how i was using pennies in my <unk> <unk> class 
 before i got to another bro 's house i stopped by a gas station and asked for a couple of plastic bags 
 once i got to his place i got changed and brought out the box of rolled pennies and the plastic bags 
 i <unk> each and every one of those motherfuckers into the bag 
 by the end of it there were plastic sleeves everywhere 
 we go to the wedding had a great time all the meanwhile he 's like where 's my $ 20 '' 
 i 'll get it to you just have to stop by the <unk> i say 
 finally we get to the reception eat some good food and enjoy ourselves 
 hey <unk> where 's my money 
 oh right let me get it from my car he get 's back to his table while i go to my car to get the money 
 when i came back i dropped it in front of him 
 it made a huge <unk> and crash as it hit the table and then some of it fell over with pennies falling all over the place 
 at first he was stunned and then was all like wtf what is this '' 
 his girlfriend and surrounding brothers were pissed too 
 then i explained to them what happened and why i gave him $ 20 in pennies 
 then they give him the death look and saying things like wtf is the matter with you '' 
 why could n't you be a decent human being and just give him his wallet back '' 
 etc 
 etc 
 finally he comes back to me with the bag of pennies and says haha you got me <unk> 
 i was just messing with you you can have it back '' 
 no that 's fine you can have it we made an agreement that i would give you $ 20 '' 
 this is n't $ 20 '' yeah it is 
 it 's legal <unk> you can use it wherever you want '' 
 hands him back the bag and he walks away shoulders <unk> over possibly due to embarrassment or the weight of the pennies 
 i smirked when i saw him bring it back to his car while his gf was bitching at him 
 some of the bros gave me major kudos for planning this out 
 while he 's not the most hated brother in our <unk> he 's been known to be a serious dick sometimes 
 best $ 20 i 've ever spent 
 tl dr- went to dinner <unk> fraternity bros forgot wallet one of them demands $ 20 for bringing the wallet back 
 wallet has <unk> value got pissed 
 decide to give him $ 20 in pennies bring it to next event we 're both at 
 embarrass him by dropping bag of pennies onto table falls everywhere his girlfriend and other fraternity bros got pissed at <unk> this was a long time ago 
 im working at <unk> gifts americans will know it so im <unk> thru the store adjusting things looking for shop <unk> etc 
 i see this woman who was every so often looking around the store as she <unk> 
 classic <unk> <unk> 
 so i hide near some <unk> and watch 
 without fail i see her slip 3 items in her purse 
 then she also takes a few other items and keeps them in her hands 
 so i wait till she moves on and go and grab 1 of each thing she pocketed 
 then i head up to the register as i see she is using another classic <unk> of buying some things to throw off the store employees who might think she has taken something 
 i tell the person on register that i will take this one 
 first i ring up each of the items i know she has in her purse and put them down on the floor 
 she smiles hands me her stuff i ring them up and give her a total 
 she looks shocked and says that does n't seem right this stuff should n't cost this much '' 
 i replied oh it does n't <unk> i added the cost of the 3 items in your purse '' 
 smile 
 she looks me in the eyes for maybe 30 seconds 
 then hands me her credit card pays and leaves 
 i was n't really worried about getting in trouble as the manager loved me 
 hell i was working there for 2 weeks before they had me fill out a application 
 i was on a flight last weekend from <unk> to chicago 
 i do this all the time for work now and usually i am very nice to the people i am seated around 
 i was given the window seat on the right side of the plane about half way in and had two empty seats next to me up until the doors were almost closed 
 at the last moment this douche knocker sits down in the middle seat and throws his shit onto the empty seat next to him 
 he get 's asked to place his stuff above and he does but mumbles the whole time doing it 
 well he goes back to sitting down in the middle not on the aisle and <unk> my arm off the arm rest 
 i was taken back by that and was like whatever and just sat there looking out the window well as we take off he leans over me and without even asking tries to shut the shade 
 i <unk> his hand out of my face and tell him in no way is he closing the shade as he is in the middle seat 
 he got mad at that and huffed a little and even pressed the flight attendant button to ask her to shut it 
 she comes by and asks if i would kindly shut it for him and i say nope i want to enjoy my view 
 she says sorry it is my call since i am in the window seat and walks away to help other people 
 i thought that was going to be the end but sadly it never is with these type of people 
 the flight from <unk> to chicago is roughly 4 hours nonstop and about half way through he has tried to shut the shade another two times as well as adjust <unk> laptop so he can see the show <unk> was watching 
 attack on <unk> 
 at this point i was done i am normally the quiet type who just <unk> in my head and rants here on reddit but not this time this time i was fed up and i wanted to make an ass outta this guy and embarrass him for the rest of the flight 
 i waited until he once again tried to shut the shade it was n't even that sunny out and the light was only shining on my seat and me i even had to turn the screen down a little to see it clearly but hell i like having the option to look out the window when i want to 
 so he does the reach thing again and this time i pause my show pop out my ear <unk> and loudly i was n't screaming but i was using my angry voice i use to yell at my dog when she does something bad and tell the guy that he is being the world biggest douche knocker and who the hell does he think he is to keep <unk> my personal space when he has an empty seat right to his left in the aisle 
 people around us got really quiet and he got all red in the face 
 a flight attendant came over and asked what was the problem and again in a not screaming but <unk> voice i told her about how much of a douche knocker this man was being and he actually got up to excuse himself to the bathroom 
 people were staring at him the whole way and when he finally came back he very awkwardly sat in the aisle seat and would n't even look my way the rest of the flight 
 fucking douche <unk> edit : i suck at spelling sorry edit 2 : my nephew has started saying douche knocker lately and he is 6 so i felt like it was a good childish insult <unk> i 'm a pizza delivery driver ... <unk> of <unk> <unk> up to the revenge** i was delivering a pizza and <unk> to a customer 
 pretty routine 
 i had delivered there once before earlier that week so i already knew where she lived but also that i was n't going to get a tip which is shitty because of how far she lived 
 i got there and found her sitting on her front porch with two of her friends and her son 
 i took her order out of my trunk and before i even reached her she loudly <unk> where is my soda '' 
 i double checked her receipt and said there was no soda on her order just a pizza and <unk> 
 she did n't believe me until i showed her the receipt 
 she was still giving me hell well i did order a soda '' 
 i asked how she ordered and she said by phone 
 well i assumed whoever took her order just <unk> forgot the soda or just did n't hear it 
 human error it happens 
 at least she was n't charged for it 
 i told her i could call the restaurant and get this fixed but she straight up told me not to even bother and that she would do it 
 well she got through to the restaurant and explained the situation in the <unk> way possible even referring to me as the pizza boy '' 
 really 
 i 'm <unk> well my manager offered her the same offer i did fix the order and have me drive all the way back to the restaurant and back with her mountain dew which she was all for until she heard how long it could potentially take 
 you see i was n't going to just go back and come right back with a soda 
 no i would have to wait for my next delivery to be ready before i could leave 
 she was n't having it 
 up until that point she kept on going on and on about how she ca n't eat pizza with something to drink 
 in my mind i just thought to myself well why not just go and get your own drink and save me my precious time 
 your not going to give me a tip anyway so this would be a big waste of time and gas on my part 
 that 's kinda inconsiderate considering this was n't my mistake '' 
 i was n't mad at the person who made the mistake shit happens but she was so rude to me and my manager who is trying her hardest to make this upset customer happy and to no avail 
 and while all of this is going on her son about 3 or 4 was <unk> on my <unk> leg and pulling on the the pizza bag ... and all three women just stood there and watched him do it 
 lady get your kid off of me and under control <unk> '' i thought to myself 
 finally she just gave up and hung up on my manager while she was still talking saying she would just pay for it as is 
 she <unk> on how stupid the whole situation was and even said that she could probably do a better job that half the people that work there 
 every little thing she said just irritated me and she was n't even trying to upset me 
 nope she just continued to treat me like i was n't even there 
 **the revenge** her order was on a credit card 
 company policy for all drivers is to check the card and a form of id before handing over the order to ensure this is n't identity theft 
 after all that i asked for her card and id 
 she said it 's her husband 's card and he 's at work 
 when i heard that it was like opportunity for petty revenge just <unk> itself in a physical form 
 it was too perfect 
 i 'm sorry ma'am but i need to see the card '' well i ca n't show you the card my husband is at work '' well ma'am i 'm sorry but i ca n't let you have this order then '' 
 oh it was a fury unlike anything i had every seen before 
 she was irate 
 she was yelling at me demanding the order 
 i said that if she could get the card i would let her have the food 
 she told me her husband worked about an hour away there was no way for her to do that 
 i told her this was all i could do and she was furious 
 i 'm gon na report you to your supervisor '' 
 oh you mean the one you hung up on i 'm sure she will take your side 
 i 'm gon na get you fired '' 
 all my managers love me good luck with that 
 i 'm never ordering from you again '' 
 good more time spent on reasonable customers 
 i got back to the restaurant with the order explained myself to the manager and he just smiled and gave me a look that said you <unk> bastard '' 
 **tl dr** customer was upset over a little mistake on her order was rude and inconsiderate to me and one of my managers 
 denied her the order when she could n't produce a credit card 
 <unk> told that to my gm the next day got a high five 
 <unk> of <unk> have been having trouble with my roommate lately we 'll call him <unk> '' 
 <unk> is an okay guy but just barely <unk> by ... he has <unk> full-time cash work in the spring and summer but come winter it 's always the same <unk> story 
 he usually ends up staying with his generous uncle for the last three <unk> anyway 
 well this year good <unk> <unk> decided at the last minute that he was done with his charity work 
 it 's december in the midwest and <unk> is suddenly without a roof above his head for winter 
 sheepishly i offer <unk> a temporary spot in my home under the condition that he is looking for work 
 <unk> agrees and <unk> my living room couch in a one bedroom apartment 
 for the first few weeks everything was fine 
 <unk> was up at <unk> am kept tabs on his own things and gave me feedback on how his work search was going 
 fast forward two months 
 <unk> 's job search now consists of him leaving in the morning or early afternoon and grabbing a coffee from <unk> a few days per week 
 i 'm not even sure how he manages to <unk> up enough change turns out he was taking a little at a time from a 10 gallon jug that i had spent years filling up 
 after a few confrontations i get a couple of <unk> lies about the companies he has been <unk> to he has n't 
 he 's been on the couch for a while now and i 'm starting to get sick of his <unk> attitude about the whole ordeal 
 i decided to do the only thing possible pretend to be him and apply for several <unk> jobs 
 in january i had helped <unk> fix up his resume and still had a copy 
 <unk> i start <unk> to any and all retail <unk> within a 10 mile radius 
 lo and behold a local chain gas station calls his free government issued cell phone after about a week and asks him to come in to interview 
 the <unk> expression on his face when he answered was priceless 
 even though he sounded a bit dumbfounded at first he did end up getting hired 
 it 's only been about a week at his new position and <unk> hates it there 
 but i just love it 
 and he 'll never know what *really* <unk> one : i was security <unk> a parking lot last night for a small local performance venue 
 parking is free but only for the patrons 
 just before the last car left a car pulled up 
 i have to pick my husband up and could n't find anywhere to park 
 i 'll be 5 minutes i promise '' 
 feeling generous i let her park so she could get her husband : my mistake 
 5 minutes passed ... then 10 ... then 30. after an hour locked up the parking lot anyway and went home for the night 
 tl dr tow trucks fix broken <unk> morning my sister had to go back to her university 3 hours away and i was supposed to wake up and give her a ride to her boyfriend 's house 
 she 's kind of a <unk> bitch and was making a big fuss the night before about wanting to be out the door at specifically <unk> i have a morning class at 7:00 at the local community college so i was trying to get us to leave at <unk> she got my dad involved and he told me to get my ass up at 5 '' 
 being the frustrated and annoyed teenager i am i decided to get revenge but not just any kind the petty kind 
 so i hid just one of her new shoes underneath her own bed 
 she woke up this morning and after everything was in the car she began to frantically search for her precious shoe but never once underneath her own bed 
 screw you sister 
 <unk> just came home with a cake 
 it was not the cake i wanted but the cake i needed 
 let me tell you the tale of how this cake came into my possession 
 i head to the local bakery after a day of failed errands to <unk> my evening with <unk> 
 there was a very large line that people seem to be <unk> 
 i get in line to order my goodies 
 the woman behind me was very important you see 
 there were 4 small groups of people waiting to order ahead of her 
 when the <unk> bakery worker asked who was next she <unk> out in broken english i next 
 eight inch orange dream cake '' 
 a few of the people in front of my <unk> that she was not next 
 she starts getting uppity my time more important than you time '' 
 the bakery worker was a <unk> she just went right to the person who was actually next 
 the important '' lady had to wait 
 there was only one of these 8 '' cakes in the case 
 the <unk> struck me 
 i ordered the 8 '' orange dream cake 
 cue <unk> from important lady '' 
 she begins swearing and freaking out telling me it is her cake and she needed it 
 this was a rare moment where i performed well under pressure 
 i replied my cake more important than you cake '' 
 the guy behind her in line started laughing his ass off and <unk> the outcome 
 so i come home and begin telling my husband and our roommate what had <unk> 
 i did n't even finish before he said is there an orange cake in that box '' 
 yes i brought home orange petty <unk> saw a post earlier about a coffee shop and it reminded me of another bit of petty revenge i had 
 i too worked at a coffee shop in college 
 our shop brought in a whole <unk> of people many of them college age 
 i always worked the <unk> shift when we got a lot of college students coming in to study 
 there was this one guy who came in often 
 truth be told he never wronged me 
 however the guy was genuinely an asshole 
 the first time i served him he referred to the people out front as <unk> '' i hate that term and was making <unk> comments about women 
 this guy was very <unk> and he went on to tell me about how he was training for a <unk> 
 i believed him as he was fit and rode his bike to the store 
 this guy viewed his <unk> '' as his treat in the mid-afternoon after his <unk> 
 after listening to this guy be a genuine asshole for a few minutes whilst talking about working out and being healthy i went ahead and made him his <unk> 
 except i made a <unk> 
 for those who do not know a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and milk made with <unk> and <unk> cream instead of milk 
 a large <unk> with flavor is about a thousand calories 
 the guy took a sip and loved it i 'm sure they 're amazing 
 he loved it so much he came in often and would always point me out and say that guy 
 he is making my drink 
 he literally thought my way '' of making the drink was the difference ... like i had some weird ability 
 little did the <unk> asshole know i was feeding him liquid fat and sugar 
 i hope his <unk> went amazing 
 so i parallel park on a busy street next to a farmer 's market feed the meter and run into a store for a breakfast sandwich 
 when coming back five minutes later a beat up minivan has parked next to my car blocking it in 
 i start out by looking around the van really quick for person to move the van but nobody around 
 i 'm assuming this jack <unk> parked with <unk> and ran into the farmer 's market instead of finding real parking like a decent human being 
 just my luck they left their keys in it 
 so i hop in move it back about 6 feet so i can pull out 
 i hop out of van but then the little voice in my head said do something '' 
 so i reach into the minivan pull out the keys and toss them on the passenger 's floor up into the corner where they would be hard to see 
 i then pulled out and left enjoying my bacon <unk> sausage <unk> and <unk> breakfast sandwich 
 edit : something i forgot to mention it was also my brother 's wedding and i was best man 
 so i was in kind of a hurry and nerves were on edge for the day 
 i was n't putting up with the parking bs 
 she stuck a dead bug from the pool into my bikini when i was n't looking ... because she loves <unk> moved into a new apartment back in may and for the first two months here we had a gentleman 's agreement in the parking lot : nobody parks in the space next to the mailboxes 
 it makes it a pain to get out of your car and a pain to get to the mailboxes although the spot is extremely convenient 
 two weeks ago this extremely redneck truck started parking there 
 the dude backs in so that he can actually open his door and get out 
 since i walk by there pretty much every day i started randomly folding the passenger side mirror 
 not every day mind you but at least once a week 
 the icing on the cake was definitely walking back from a friend 's one afternoon and seeing him leave the parking lot and start driving down the road while trying to reach out the window and unfold the mirror 
 keep parking there buddy i can keep this up <unk> is an old one and i was just an observer but i think some of you will still get a kick out of it 
 many years ago i took a co-op job on a construction site as an <unk> <unk> 
 there was a guy on another crew who had one of those nail guns that take a small blank <unk> <unk> and fire nails into concrete 
 sorry i do n't recall the name of it 
 i do n't know what his job was but you 'd see him from time to time looking over a set of prints then hear that thing going off a few minutes later 
 after the first time or two it just became background noise and nobody really paid any attention to it 
 one day while my crew was taking my lunch break we heard that nail gun <unk> over and over and over 
 normally you 'd hear one or two shots and then it would be quiet for a while so this was a bit unusual but nothing that anyone bothered to investigate 
 30 minutes later there was some yelling and a lot of cursing coming from the same general area the nail gun had been during lunch 
 curiosity finally got the better of me and i made an excuse to head over that way 
 i was greeted by the sight of several guys staring at a tool box in the middle of the floor 
 it turns out the guy with the nail gun had gotten into an argument with his boss and was fired 
 he waited until his boss went off site to lunch and came back 
 he found his boss 's <unk> <unk> opened it up took out all the tools and proceeded to permanently <unk> it to the concrete floor before carefully putting everything back in the box 
 i have no idea what the fight was about or who was in the wrong but i ca n't help but be amused by this even <unk> later 
 ok so fall semester last year just starting the final year of my <unk> 
 i 'm in a 500 level computer graphics course 
 the professor is the department chair is a great teacher and is overall a great guy 
 during one of the first lectures he asks the class one question : how do you draw a circle without using the sin and cos functions '' 
 the fact is that <unk> functions take a computer a pretty long time to do compared to <unk> operations 
 the easy answer which uses <unk> functions is to start with an angle at 0 draw a point at cos x sin x <unk> the angle by a small amount and stop once the angle 's at <unk> 
 the other students mostly grad students kinda just sat and <unk> the awkward silence that suggested that nobody actually knew how to do it 
 i thought about it for a bit then raised my hand 
 i explained to the professor that since a circle is the set of all points the same distance from a center you could just use the distance formula with a set radius slowly <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> and draw a point at x y 
 the professor thought about it for maybe half a second then simply stated no that 's wrong '' 
 cue mild embarrassment 
 i was slightly <unk> by my classmates and professor as somebody who did n't know what he was talking about 
 it was a mild inconvenience but an inconvenience nonetheless and i needed to show him that he was wrong 
 well he happened to assign us a project that included drawing a bunch of circles 
 guess how i drew them 
 i made sure to note the <unk> i was using 
 i got an a on the assignment 
 he saw my code and realized he was slightly wrong 
 justice served 
 **edit : i realize that the method i used was not <unk> most efficient way and that there are tons of ways to do it faster 
 ** **edit 2 : i love how this has turned into a giant <unk> <unk> of my students is the biggest jerk i 've ever had the misfortune of meeting 
 seriously he 's a cancer in my classroom 
 but i ca n't <unk> his education even if he could n't give two shits about learning 
 i treat him like i would any of my other students 
 i do my job 
 but to get back at him for being such an asshole whenever i hand out notes or <unk> i make sure to give him the ones that are messed up in some way 
 <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in a way so that it does n't fit properly in a <unk> <unk> <unk> you name it 
 those are all set aside just for him 
 they 're not messed up to the point that they 're <unk> or anything but just enough that one might find it annoying 
 i do n't care that it probably does n't bother him it gives me satisfaction 
 have a good summer <unk> am female and this happened years ago when i was about <unk> my best friend <unk> and i lived in a small town growing up 
 it was summer and since we could n't yet drive we spent most of our days running around town on our bikes 
 our main thing was to get pop from the <unk> <unk> in front of the grocery store then go across the street and sit in the <unk> on the <unk> lawn and drink it 
 then we would go to the city park and play on the <unk> <unk> 
 because we were cool like that 
 one day we decided to switch it up and go to the playground of the elementary school in town 
 we were making ourselves sick on the <unk> when two younger boys maybe <unk> showed up on their bikes 
 they started harassing us calling us names and stupid crap like that 
 i could n't even tell you for sure what they said but surely something beyond forgiveness and we were pissed 
 we said some rude things back and went to play on one of the <unk> 
 they continued yelling rude things to us from across the playground 
 then they threw sand on the <unk> and peed on it so we could n't play on it anymore 
 we were steaming 
 they were very proud of themselves 
 then for whatever reason they took their t-shirts off it was hot i guess and ran around the playground being little assholes 
 and then i had a plan 
 i whispered it quickly to <unk> who nervously laughed then we shot across the playground to the <unk> 
 the boys had wandered off somewhere out of our sight 
 we each picked up a shirt and rubbed it in the sand and pee the boys so <unk> left for us 
 we were giggling like idiots the whole time 
 hurry '' 
 <unk> <unk> when we were done and we grabbed our bikes and took off 
 i remember us laughing hysterically the whole way home 
 one of my <unk> <unk> 
 : tl dr two little assholes peed on our <unk> and we rubbed their t-shirts in it 
 edit : t-shirts in td <unk> 
 not <unk> 
 my bad 
 i work in a coffee shop about 15 hours a week while i attend a university 
 i love my job and have been working pretty much the same shifts every semester so far this <unk> every saturday morning 
 there is a group of older women who come in every single saturday morning at 8 am sharp 
 these women are the most <unk> rude customers i 've ever dealt with 
 every saturday they order the same drink 
 one of them is especially horrible 
 she tells the other workers exactly what <unk> she wants and if you are new you ca n't make her drink naturally i always make it because i 've been there for 2 years 
 well for two years she has ordered a <unk> late with sugar free <unk> 
 well she 's the worst so i give her 2 % milk 
 i am drunk with power 
 edit : for everyone freaking out i can <unk> you when you walk into a coffee shop and you order a drink the barista will grab whatever milk is already <unk> and ready to go 
 even if you specify 
 i have worked in 4 coffee shops all in different states 
 every single barista does it 
 calm yourself 
 new edit 
 okay i 'm sorry for <unk> 
 i would also like to clarify that i would never leave milk sitting for more than 5 minutes 
 also i would never give someone <unk> if they asked for decaf 
 i would also never ever give someone <unk> who asked for soy 
 that 's just not right 
 hey guys first off wanted to say i love this sub 
 all the stories are great 
 i have regularly <unk> in <unk> arts for the past 8 years 
 started in high school got me through college and now i 'm still at it in the professional world 
 i love every class and would recommend everyone try it at some point regardless of style 
 anyway i digress 
 i would often attend a lunch class held at the school 
 this was a great class because it was smaller so i would get more 1 on 1 help 
 this is where i was driving to at the beginning of my story 
 enter <unk> d 
 i was on a two lane <unk> about to exit to the road where my school is located 
 out of nowhere d cuts me off from the left lane to make the exit 
 he almost clipped me 
 as i laid into my horn d shot me the finger and brake checked me pretty bad i had an older car at the time and had to swerve off to avoid hitting him 
 anyway i <unk> the incident off and continued to make my way to the class 
 but that is when i saw d in front of me 
 he seemed to be making the same turns i was 
 it was n't until he pulled into the parking lot and got out that it occurred to me ... he 's in my class 
 and must be new 
 did n't recognize him 
 as i got out of the car a few cars away d gave me the look of you wan na go '' 
 that was until he saw me completely get out 
 you see before you reach black belt at my school you have a white uniform like the one he was wearing 
 when you reach black belt you may also wear a black one 
 well i was a 2nd degree at the the time and my uniform was a nicely faded grey - a sign i had been there a while 
 d noticed my uniform and the greatest oh shit face <unk> upon him 
 i just laughed and went past him into the school 
 now i know what you 're thinking ... i kicked his ass right 
 well no i did n't 
 but he did <unk> from doing bag work with me and i threw him around like a <unk> doll during <unk> 
 the only part of the guy that was hurt during class was his pride 
 and i loved every minute of <unk> work i have a parking garage i am assigned to 
 normally most people are pretty good about parking and the spots are a decent size so i do n't have a problem 
 i normally get in around 7:30 right at shift change and usually get a good spot '' lower level close to the door 
 today i had a 7:30 meeting so needed to be parked and in much earlier 
 i assumed i would probably have to park higher up because so few people would be leaving when i get in 
 so i pull in the garage fully prepared to start my day in a <unk> spot 
 but what is this 
 what do i see 
 is that a spot right near the elevators on the first level 
 glorious morning 
 as i get closer i see why the spot is empty the car next to it is parked over the line making it near impossible for a normal sized car to get <unk> mean this is a bad parking job 
 jerk 
 i can understand why no one parked next to you almost no car would safely fit 
 but me i drive a <unk> 
 i gracefully <unk> in initially <unk> to be about <unk> from the cars on either side of me which puts me over my line of parking space as well 
 as i am getting ready to grab my bags my very very petty revenge takes form 
 i pull back out and pull as close to the poorly parked car as i can 
 this takes several minutes to get within inches of the car until it would be near impossible for a human to get in the other car 's driver door 
 i realize my car is at risk for having a door <unk> into it 
 hell my car is a <unk> with plenty of battle <unk> already 
 i doubt this person will <unk> up their car unless they are as petty as me 
 so i 'm not worried about a new scrape or scratch 
 as i exit my vehicle i see i am well within the lines of my spot it is just that the dick next to me is over his lines 
 enjoy climbing over the passenger seat to get into your vehicle <unk> inconsiderate jerk 
 tl dr parking space reserved for <unk> <unk> <unk> saturday night i went to a halloween party at a friends place 
 there were familiar faces there as well as a few i had n't met 
 one of them was a roommate of someone i already knew 
 let 's call him jackass 
 we talked a bit during the night and he seemed like a decent guy 
 at this point i should mention that my friend and i had gone as a couple of dead whores 
 nothing too bad 
 i wore a dress but it was loose enough for me to wear shorts underneath 
 as the night progressed he became more drunk 
 at about 1:45 i claim the only couch in the house that does n't fold out into a bed there are 4 <unk> in the house as well as 4 beds 
 a half hour later jackass asks if i mind sharing the couch with him 
 i say sure because i figured that the rest of the <unk> and beds had been taken over at this point 
 i do n't mind sharing just as long as i can get some sleep 
 ten minutes goes by in beautiful silence and then he says 'hey whore can you give me a back massage 
 i tell him no i want to sleep 
 five minutes later he asks the same and i reply with 'fuck off i need to sleep 
 apparently he does n't like this because he grabs my wrist and tries to pull me over to his side of the couch we had our heads on opposite ends of the couch saying <unk> n't worry i 'll repay you 
 i 'll give you a back massage too 
 i had to kick jackass inner thigh with my <unk> because he was n't getting go 
 thankfully that was the end of that 
 for the moment 
 he kept grabbing my ass claiming he was looking for his phone 
 bullshit 
 at this point i was tired pissed and really in need of some space 
 but then he asks me to cuddle with him and tell him no you 're drunk and you 've already gotten on my last nerve 
 jackass : <unk> that 's right 
 you 're not into dudes 
 you <unk> 
 that 's when i lost it 
 i 'm not a <unk> but i do have complete and <unk> respect for everyone 's sexual <unk> 
 this was just incredibly disrespectful 
 i could n't stand to be around this guy anymore so i kicked him off the couch 
 to make sure he did n't try forget back on the couch i got a friend to take the other side 
 the next morning just before i was leaving i went back to the couch to make sure i did n't leave anything behind 
 i spot a wallet on the floor and what do you know it belongs to jackass who moved to one of the <unk> after i kicked him off the couch 
 he was still asleep so i dropped his wallet behind the couch 
 i hope it took forever for him to find it 
 his drivers <unk> was how i knew the wallet was his and i know for a fact he drove to the party hands off and fuck off <unk> : i had a <unk> housemate my junior year of college who we shall refer to as <unk> 
 she was passive aggressive bitchy post-it notes all over the house asked other housemates to bring up problems ah had with me so she would n't look like the bad guy and seemed to think that because she had moved into the house the year before i was more like a long-term guest than a real housemate 
 <unk> was a senior and would always leave a mess saying you 'll understand when you get to senior year there just is n't time to clean up right away '' but would insist i had to do my dishes the moment i 'd stopped eating 
 we shared a bathroom that was connected to her room but had another door to the outside hall 
 if i did something wrong like forget to turn off the fan after my shower or wash my <unk> spit out of the sink completely <unk> would punish me by locking the outside door to the bathroom from the inside then leave for class locking her bedroom door so there was no way i could use the shower 
 i had to keep all my toiletries and toothbrush and towels in my room so i could use the other bathroom which 3 other girls were sharing 
 story : towards the end the fall semester i was throwing a dinner party for the people who were going to be in the spring play with me 
 i like to cook curry from scratch which can use a lot of pots and pans and <unk> boards 
 i 'd set my chicken in <unk> and gone out to get the ingredients for <unk> 
 i guess <unk> did n't like the fact that i had set up my clean work station ahead of time because i returned home to find everything gone 
 all the pots pans and <unk> boards were missing 
 my guests were set to arrive in minutes and i was now having to <unk> <unk> boards out of cardboard and clean paper 
 i found a note that said if you ca n't take care of my stuff <unk> all of it came with the <unk> then maybe you do n't get to use it 
 : love <unk> '' i managed to make do with <unk> a neighbour 's pots and pans but was furious when i found out she 'd hidden all of ours under her bed and locked herself in her room listening to me freak out 
 revenge : depending on how many credits you 've completed you 're given a very strict time slot for <unk> 
 people who live on campus are forced to use the campus internet which is stupid slow and <unk> a lot which <unk> all of your class selection 
 as off-campus people we were safe from that 
 well *i* was 
 <unk> was n't 
 i found out what time her <unk> slot was then with one minute to go i unplugged the router 
 i heard <unk> screech then i plugged it back in 
 2 minutes later i did the same thing and <unk> off 
 this time she came stomping out and i heard her smacking the router around 
 we played this game for about ten minutes before i heard her run out the door and start her car presumably driving to campus to register 
 she ended up getting <unk> for almost every class 
 i regret nothing 
 **tl dr : if you hide shared property i 'll hide the shared <unk> edit : for spelling 
 it 's been a long morning.i was getting into the boarding line at <unk> airport for a seven hour flight to <unk> 
 two lines were merging and all of a sudden some absolute cunt came and roughly pushed in front of me and said 'that will teach you to bunk in front of someone two times your size i am quite short he was tall and <unk> he was the kind of guy who must have been a douche in high-school and carried on that role into his mid thirties 
 anyway i got on the plane and found my seat the bastard was putting his stuff in the <unk> locker and setting stuff on his seat behind me 
 we locked eyes and i smiled 
 he broke the contact almost immediately and <unk> to the furthest aisle seat he could 
 it was a packed flight so very quickly a man told him he was in the wrong seat the cunt said 'fuck sake they are just seats find another 
 the man went to the flight attendant and moved <unk> <unk> to his correct seat directly behind me and beside a fat <unk> man 
 as soon as the <unk> seatbelt sign was off i fully reclined my chair and went to sleep when the meal arrived i ate mine quickly and reclined glad to hear him say <unk> fuck sake 
 i must say i did enjoy my petty revenge and it made me feel much better 
 when my mum was a kid money was tight 
 not quite <unk> but not far off 
 when my mother was in <unk> school about 6 or 7 years old she was invited to a birthday party for one of the kids in her year 
 while she was there this <unk> <unk> girl from her school who was already on the path to becoming a total bitch decided it was a good idea to inform my mother that the party dress she was wearing was <unk> ugly because it had been <unk> by my grandmother rather than having been bought from a store like hers 
 she continued to rub my mum 's nose in her <unk> <unk> and insult my grandma 's work at length before eventually getting bored and deciding to go find someone else to be a bitch to 
 as you can imagine my mother was furious 
 she loved that dress <unk> my grandma had taken the trouble to make it for her and decided she would have her revenge 
 now the girl in question had long blonde <unk> that she was <unk> proud of 
 my mum had been eating a <unk> when <unk> came up to her and as she turned to walk away my mother very quickly and carefully took the <unk> out of her mouth and stuck it dead centre in this girl 's hair 
 the <unk> was n't spotted by anyone for a while by which time it was completely stuck 
 <unk> ended up having to have that piece of hair cut off which in turn required all her hair to be cut short to match 
 she cried 
 my mother <unk> 
 and no one ever knew it was her 
 tldr : rich snobby girl makes fun of my mother for having a homemade dress my mother causes her to have all her hair cut off 
 **background** : so i 'm in my final year at university preparing for end of year exams - slightly stressful under any circumstances 
 add in three housemates who are on <unk> year who come home from work blare music all night and play <unk> non-stop and shout at every goal near miss <unk> <unk> ... you get the picture 
 they 're so loud that the neighbors have complained on multiple occasions but they do n't seem to give a shit 
 when they 're off work it 's time to have fun fuck everyone else 
 i honestly would n't mind if it was like a couple of games a night but they play for like a solid 3 hours each night of which almost all is filled with the sounds of screams and shouting 
 i 'm like a week away from starting my final year exams and have asked them to just keep the shouting down as it 's quite hard to <unk> with people screaming at the top of their lungs every five minutes 
 when i ask i get told <unk> sure no problem but within 5 mins it normally starts 
 going downstairs and asking them again is just greeted with huge sighs and making me feel like i 'm the one being inconsiderate to them followed by it starting up again within 10 mins of me going back upstairs 
 <unk> revenge** : well i had enough of their shit and unfortunately for them i know my way around a router 
 even worse news for them is that when you are disconnected from an online game it automatically <unk> as a <unk> loss even if you were <unk> ahead 
 so recently i have taken enormous pleasure from <unk> them from games which sound to be <unk> intense 
 i know the rough length of a <unk> match so know the perfect <unk> to go into the router settings and briefly ban and <unk> the playstation so they <unk> disconnect 
 at times i will even go downstairs into the kitchen and do it on my phone so they do n't get suspicious and think it 's me on my computer 
 my <unk> moment was when i heard an extra loud <unk> from downstairs followed shortly by a <unk> for fuck 's sake no not again 
 going downstairs i <unk> they had come back from being <unk> down to be winning <unk> it took all my self control to <unk> the <unk> joy and laughter building inside 
 what is even better is it has meant they have been getting so angry at losing their games and receiving bad <unk> that they have almost given up on playing <unk> 
 **tl dr** - housemates give 0 shits i 'm trying to <unk> for my final year exams and make noise playing <unk> all night every night 
 so i have been taking my revenge by secretly <unk> their online games <unk> in them getting bad <unk> and not playing it anymore out of anger 
 i used to work doing training for a software company 
 often i <unk> to carry out the training at the customers site 
 once i did this for a company in <unk> clue : their factory is in the shape of a giant <unk> 
 now when you travel abroad you get a per <unk> to cover any extra costs 
 if you get your food paid for by the customer you should <unk> a certain amount for breakfast lunch or dinner 
 this client made me work through the lunch hour supplying shitty slices of pizza as lunch 
 no choice 
 i refused to <unk> that part of my per <unk> and a week later my boss tells me their manager had gone through our expenses for the training and demanded that they be <unk> the part of the per <unk> they paid for my lunch since they had <unk> food '' 
 they also rang up my hotel and found out that breakfast was included and wanted that back too 
 we 're talking maybe 20 <unk> here 
 this was then <unk> from my next months <unk> 
 <unk> a month later they need more training for 7 new people 
 i could easily have <unk> there but instead said that i had a personal thing and they would have to fly to our <unk> 
 probably cost them an extra <unk> dollars compared to me flying there 
 <unk> <unk> 've always liked to fish 
 no one else in my family cares for it but i started with a pocket <unk> '' i got for xmas when i was about 7. i moved up to a larger pole with a closed faced <unk> and using <unk> several years later 
 i learned through trial and error how to tie <unk> cast etc 
 i have an older brother that has always been a dick 
 he 's about 4 years older than me and i have many <unk> from his accidents '' though the years 
 my family got an <unk> to go to a <unk> at another family 's large farm <unk> 
 the old farmer that owned the place <unk> me that there were big bass in the <unk> and if i waited until just before it got dark <unk> would be good 
 about 7pm everyone had eaten and were done <unk> 
 jack the old farmer gave me a big <unk> <unk> and acted <unk> impressed as he watched me tie it on 
 i went over away from the people and cast along the <unk> near some <unk> 
 first cast - bam big old bass took the <unk> and started fighting 
 i yelled out big mistake and started trying to <unk> it in 
 my yell brought my brother running over and despite telling him to leave me alone he ran to the edge of the water grabbed my line and tried to yank the fish out of the water - breaking the line and losing the borrowed <unk> 
 while he was still bent over and holding the line i hit him with the <unk> pole using my long <unk> up rage 
 it left a <unk> bleeding <unk> across his back which took quite a while to disappear 
 he ran screaming and crying to mom who was furious 
 jack lit his pipe and told my mom i 'd have done it too do n't mess with a <unk> '' 
 he turned and winked at me and i did n't get into anymore <unk> live at college where generally people do not ever feel the need to slow down for pedestrians 
 if it is monday - friday i will haul my ass across the street so commuters can speed because generally i am running late too 
 the struggle is real i get it 
 however today is sunday 
 there is no class today 
 why the fuck are you speeding 
 also you see me and other people crossing the street 
 if you were n't fucking flying in the first place you would not of even had to slow down for us 
 but you were not going a reasonable speed 
 seeing my friends and i already halfway through the crosswalk this mother fucker sped up 
 lol 
 im a senior and not a single fuck do i give if i get hit by a car it would be less stressful than my current life of all 400 level courses 
 so please continue to speed up in the hopes that i will run the rest of the way to avoid being hit 
 you are mistaken 
 i slowed down and made sure he had to completely stop and wait for me to cross the street 
 he then felt the need to scream move bitches '' out of his window 
 <unk> nope 
 really 
 you 're going to speed and call me a bitch 
 oh no would you look at that my shoe is untied 
 i took the time to retie both my shoes in the middle fucking road 
 i then stood up and replied to a text message and took my fucking time getting out of the road 
 this is pretty long 
 so i take my car to discount tire and have the tire <unk> and put on 
 it 's going to be an hour and a half wait so i walk to taco bell across the street 
 i walk up to the counter and the <unk> trailer park lady looks like time has not been kind to her so i decide i 'll be polite and patient 
 i order and she fucks it up like 3 times 
 no <unk> everyone makes mistakes 
 she finally gets it right and i get my drink and have a seat 
 behind me is this fat <unk> asian woman 
 she looks like she 's desperately trying to retain her figure after she lost it to her two obnoxious kids 
 she orders 4 packs of <unk> no joke 4 and stands next to the counter while waiting for her kids to teach themselves how to <unk> in public 
 no one calls my order after a wait but it 's not bothering me as i 'm browsing reddit on my phone and pondering whether or not <unk> children really is difficult or if people are just simply too lazy entitled and stupid to do it properly 
 the fat asian woman sits down with her <unk> and i hear her son say <unk> that 's not ours '' which prompts me to look up and see her take a big ass bite out of my <unk> 
 good god the son knows stealing is wrong when the mother does n't 
 my first emotion is pure rage and i want to angrily flip her fucking table over and give her kids to child protective services 
 i decide that maybe she did order it and there has been a mistake 
 i ask the people at the counter wtf and no one knows wtf happened to my food 
 the man i saw start making it literally said he does n't remember 
 so i very politely ask for a refund 
 the woman at the register looks like she 's about to cry and <unk> me to allow them to remake it 
 i politely decline and say you already made it did n't call my number and gave it away to the woman over there '' 
 the manager loses his shit and asks the lady for her receipt 
 she says she threw it away and her daughter <unk> on her by giving it to the manager anyway 
 he says she now has to pay for the food 
 on my way out the door with my refund in in cash not on my card for some reason i tell her it 's ok ma'am i did n't want my lunch anyway enjoy '' 
 she turns bright fucking red and starts yelling at her kids 
 so i lose my shit as i 'm occasionally known to do and call her out 
 i told the entire place how she heard her son tell her that that was n't their food and her fat ass ate it anyway 
 i told her she was an awful example to her children a terrible mother and just a pathetic human being in general 
 it 's a shame that your kids know right from wrong better then you do '' 
 she froze looked like she was about to cry and did n't say shit 
 she finally agreed to pay and i took my debit card back from the manager then bounced 
 now i 'm eating <unk> at <unk> which is way better anyway 
 today was a good day 
 tl dr dont steal its just a <unk> thing to do and youre only making the world a worse play for all of us 
 raise your fucking kids right 
 a few months ago an acquaintance of mine found my facebook open on my computer while i went to the bathroom during lunch in our uni <unk> 
 he decided to message my recent <unk> saying that we should get back together 
 this caused a shitstorm that i had to deal with and i was n't too happy 
 one of my friends who was also sitting at the table told me that he 'd been messing with my computer and i put two and two together 
 i was pretty livid but i decided that revenge was a dish best served cold 
 i waited until he was <unk> a party at his place and i put my plan into action 
 i had a friend serve as a <unk> and i went into the guy 's room 
 his computer was n't <unk> and his facebook was automatically logged in 
 i proceeded to go down his friends list and find girls with pictures of them in <unk> 
 i tried to pick ones he did n't talk to a whole lot but went to our university 
 bonus points if it was a group of girls 
 i <unk> about 50 <unk> pictures 
 i made sure to <unk> pictures of his <unk> that i knew of 
 i watched his facebook friend count <unk> by 7 over the next day 
 take that <unk> week while on the phone with my dad my grandma complained about how she never got a christmas present from us 
 that got my parents so mad 
 for the <unk> years i 've been <unk> we 've always given her great presents i would dare say that some years they were better than the ones my brother and i got 
 but grandma is borderline <unk> any clothing she got would immediately be stored away somewhere never to be worn and apparently <unk> goods are n't presents 
 so for this year 's christmas they got my grandpa a big basket with chocolate <unk> coffee <unk> and wine his favorite things 
 my grandma will get a big good nothing 
 been lurking around this sub for a few months thought i share a story from few years ago 
 <unk> i am not sure if it count as petty 
 <unk> : ** about 5-6 years ago my grandfather came visit us in the state 
 he stayed with us for about 4 months 
 one day while he was rearranging our <unk> he <unk> and we rushed him to the hospital 
 the er doc said it was some sort of <unk> and had to stay for the treatment 
 we set up a schedule so at least one person is always with him in the hospital 
 <unk> : ** the resident was absolutely horrible 
 he was rude demeaning and borderline racist 
 he will often completely ignore our questions or <unk> 
 more than once i saw him making fun of other <unk> and even <unk> 
 one of the nurse told us that since the resident 's father was one of the head of the department who is also a war buddy of the <unk> <unk> he gets away with a lot of things 
 no one likes him but they ca n't do much about it 
 **revenge : ** one of my close friend <unk> us at the hospital 
 he mentioned that his dad sat on that hospital 's board of <unk> 
 upon hearing that i told him everything i <unk> about this resident 
 my friend was disgusted and immediately called his dad 
 two hours later his dad the <unk> <unk> and the attending were in the room making sure my grandfather is doing okay 
 my grandfather been his usual <unk> self was trying to convince them that my friend and i exaggerated the situation but the statements from the <unk> was more than enough 
 i am not quite sure what really happened <unk> but i never saw that resident around that part of the hospital after that 
 **background** i work in a big international company <unk> as a part of the <unk> <unk> basically we do everything for everyone 
 the manager of the <unk> team is a <unk> nice <unk> cunt 
 she employed her son full time when he turned 18 and gave him his own pick at what hours he would like 
 so now he has become her whipping boy when she is around never but when she is not he does as he likes 
 he orders people around shouts at people and sits on his big fat ass and does nothing at all 
 **the actual story** so the other day after feeling bad all day i told him that if i feel this shitty i will not be coming in tomorrow and i will call his mum and tell her 
 so i carry on working the rest of the shift i think he 's cool i dont know why everyone <unk> him off 
 we are locking up and he asks me if i smoked weed 
 i said oh yeah im going to smoke some when i get home 
 we carry on talking and he admits that he smokes to 
 shift ends 
 i call in sick the following day because i feel really shitty 
 so when i return to work 2 days later i found out he told his mum that i couldnt be <unk> to work '' and i was going to lie to get the day off 
 manager pulls me aside <unk> me 
 he <unk> around work i lied to get the day off 
 the same day the manager <unk> me i also get a random locker search 
 i have some items in my bag that i bought earlier <unk> 
 they didnt want to see the <unk> instead they sniffed through my bag saying they where looking for something in particular obviously the weed 
 so by now i know that he <unk> on me to his mum twice 
 i then decided i was going to have some fun with it 
 **revenge** so then i asked him if he wanted to buy some <unk> something he said he takes all the time from me 
 i will be bringing quite a lot in tomorrow at work so he can buy 
 i <unk> that i would have about half a <unk> lol 
 so when i get to work scan in i get a call from the manager to meet me in the locker room 
 by the time i get in there three private security officers are following me from the staff room 
 then i go into the locker room there are a further 8 officers and 1 drug <unk> dog 
 i get made to open my locker and empty my bag 
 during this time the manager and her son are standing in the locker room with me smirking 
 also the regional manager is <unk> so he is in there to 
 no drugs in my bag 
 store gets fined a lot of money for wasting time 
 his mum gets <unk> for calling in the search he gets the sack and <unk> to fight me 
 he gets arrested for assault 
 he gets 7 months in prison 
 a nice added bonus to my last pay packet 
 i leave the company the next week to go to university 
 we are even 
 <unk> basically i was coming in work one day and he was waiting for me in the staff area 
 i thought nothing of it and just got changed when i was getting changed coincidentally the a security guard was just starting his shift to 
 so then when the guy saw me i was with the security guard 
 he walked up to me and basically punched me in the back of the head whilst i was walking away cheap shot 
 but it was all on camera and the security guard was a witness to it all 
 his mum got a new job after this 
 edit : added the prison <unk> : i <unk> an <unk> program for high school students with learning <unk> 
 one of our job sites is a large grocery store where they bag <unk> and front shelves 
 story : most of the customers are great with the students 
 they realize that they are teenagers learning a job 
 not the <unk> 
 she is an older woman with pure white hair and a horrible attitude 
 i first encountered her when one of my students <unk> '' was <unk> 
 <unk> has autism so needs <unk> on social interaction 
 <unk> was standing with her cart in front of the <unk> goods 
 did n't appear to be looking at the cans i think she was checking her <unk> needed to put back a couple cans of <unk> and her cart was just barely blocking them 
 i whispered to <unk> to say excuse me and he politely says excuse me i need to put these back '' 
 she <unk> like he had asked her to run a marathon <unk> 
 she <unk> at me i 'm standing here he can wait he does n't need to do this aisle while i 'm in it '' 
 i apologize and take <unk> to an aisle as far away as possible 
 now part of <unk> autism is he has certain <unk> 
 getting yelled at and breaking his routine threw him off the rest of the day 
 about a month later she is back in the store 
 i try to keep <unk> in different aisles 
 we are finishing up the soup section when i see her come down the aisle 
 <unk> only has one can left but of course she parks her cart and walks in front of the one section he is working on 
 she again looks at me not acknowledging him and says i 'm going to be shopping here '' 
 <unk> at entire section of shelf 
 * i calmly say he just has the one can to put back it goes right there '' 
 and point to the spot in the upper left of the shelf a good 3 feet from her 
 she rudely barks out he can do it later i 'm looking at this <unk> 
 by this time he is standing right where it needs to go 
 she can still see the entire shelf 
 i nod to him to put it back he does and we go to another aisle without making eye contact with her 
 <unk> looks a little upset she was mean again 
 a few weeks later she is back 
 luckily my students are bagging on the front end so they avoid her 
 its about 8 minutes until my student 's bus comes when she gets in que 
 i wait until she is next in line then go up and tell my student who is working there that she can stop when she is done with the current order 
 i then pull the other three students off of there lines about 5 minutes earlier than usual 
 as my students waited for their bus i got to watch her bag half her own groceries 
 the replacement bagger got there just as she <unk> : my office is on a quiet street with a painted yellow curb out front 
 when i say quiet street i mean it 's half a standard city block with a dead end so we do n't get a lot of traffic 
 our <unk> are all over the place so when someone forgets something at the office rather than <unk> in a <unk> they park their car out front for a few minutes to run in and grab whatever it was 
 this usually is n't a big deal quiet street remember but the <unk> officers <unk> and many of my co-workers have been ticketed for illegal parking at a yellow curb 
 the setup : one day i left for lunch and saw a city parking enforcement car parked <unk> in the middle of the yellow curb 
 it was actually blocking the wheelchair dip shame 
 i could n't see the <unk> officer around you know <unk> cars or something so i took a picture of the car and went out for lunch 
 when i came back an hour later the car was still illegally parked and again no <unk> officer to be found 
 took another picture of the car and continued into my building 
 i have no idea where that person was but i can <unk> you they were not <unk> out parking tickets 
 we 're 4 blocks away from a major <unk> shopping street with plenty of legal and much more convenient places to park 
 i suspect they were off eating lunch or something 
 the revenge : since i love a little <unk> after lunch with a healthy side of petty revenge i get back to my desk and email the city 's parking enforcement department 
 i detail that 1 one of their officers has parked illegally 2 for over an hour and 3 this sets a poor example when so many of us have been ticketed yeah i laid it on thick 
 i included all said pictures of course 
 the result : a week later i heard back from parking enforcement 
 they confirmed that the <unk> officer had indeed parked illegally and explained that illegal parking is allowed if the <unk> officer was in the <unk> of their duties 
 since the officer apparently was n't in the <unk> of their duties the office also confirmed that they had been reprimanded for their actions 
 they also apologized bonus 
 that was 6 years ago 
 have n't seen parking enforcement around since 
 peace was thus restored to the land 
 tldr : parking enforcement officer parks illegally gets reprimanded has n't been seen <unk> used to manage a convenience store and we hired this woman - lets call her evil whore or <unk> for short 
 <unk> looked good on paper but she was not a nice person 
 <unk> worked mornings with a lady i will call <unk> 
 <unk> 's son john worked afternoons with me 
 one day john told his mom something rather surprising and his mom shocked <unk> in <unk> 
 by the end of the week <unk> had <unk> john to the rest of the staff and <unk> how <unk> found out to include her walking in on john and another guy 
 fortunately the staff loved john and <unk> around him but what a nasty thing to do 
 in addition to being a bitch <unk> was also an alcoholic 
 one time she brought her <unk> son to work where he spent the balance of the day whining that he wanted a lemon drop 
 finally a coworker - a sweet girl who liked to make people happy - bought a bag of lemon drops for the kid who informed her that she must be stupid because a lemon drop is <unk> lemon juice and sugar 
 anyway although things started out alright eventually it got to the point where if we scheduled <unk> to work on a monday morning she failed to show up a full 50 % of the time 
 it had been about 6 months since we hired her which coincidentally was how long she needed to work before being <unk> for unemployment benefits again when we stopped scheduling her for the <unk> shift on <unk> 
 we gave her the <unk> instead which obviously <unk> in her losing some hours 
 <unk> did not like that 
 it was about <unk> at night and i was at home when my phone rang 
 it was <unk> drunk and yelling at me about her hours 
 she called me a stupid bitch a few times and kept repeating a simple <unk> : fire me fire me fire me '' 
 so i eventually hung up and i called my boss and told her what had happened 
 we talked a bit and decided <unk> was more trouble than she was worth so i called her back and said i 've thought it over <unk> and i have decided to take your advice and fire you 
 goodbye '' 
 but that is n't the revenge bit 
 the revenge is when she filed for unemployment 
 i know a bit about how <unk> work so i decided she would n't be getting unemployment benefits this time around 
 we <unk> her claim and gave the unemployment office my contact information 
 when they called they asked me why i had let her go 
 it went something like this : unemployment guy : <unk> says you cut her hours 
 can you explain why that happened '' 
 me : well <unk> does a good job when she 's there but unfortunately i think he has an alcohol problem 
 she has n't been <unk> on monday mornings so we decided to let her sleep in 
 <unk> : but she was a good employee other than that '' 
 me : yes and no 
 she 's good at the work but she <unk> a gay coworker to the whole company last month and the last straw was when she called me at home and started swearing at me 
 she called me a bitch while i was in my own home 
 i do n't have to put up with that 
 i was in my living room and she 's yelling at me saying <unk> me you stupid bitch and i am not going to be called a bitch in my own home '' 
 <unk> : wait ... she asked you to fire her '' 
 me : yeah 
 while calling me a bitch 
 in my own home no less '' 
 <unk> : but she said the words <unk> me '' 
 me : over and over again 
 but i seriously do n't need to be called a bitch in my own home '' 
 <unk> : but she asked to be fired 
 okay i think you 've answered my questions 
 thank you '' 
 i hung up with a huge grin on my face 
 it was a week or two before the letter from unemployment came : <unk> was denied and would have to get a job 
 <unk> fucking <unk> 
 tl dr : <unk> bitch has to get a job 
 edited to break up the wall of text 
 and <unk> 've had to live next to these two <unk> and their awful children since <unk> when they moved into the ugly <unk> towards the end of the street that 's so big it <unk> two units close to the local park 
 since the start they 've been so rude obnoxious loud and aggressive 
 i have to listen to the parents screaming at the children because the two children were screaming homophobic <unk> at each other or being <unk> 
 no wonder they try to pickle their <unk> every night 
 anyway since day 1 the <unk> have been <unk> various balls over the fence like <unk> <unk> rules style soccer balls <unk> balls <unk> balls cricket balls 
 i kept joking about giving the shit to charity and now i 'm doing it for real 
 a red <unk> just smacked into the window and nearly broke it so i 'm taking it to work with me at the op shop and it can be <unk> or donated to a local <unk> school for the sports shed 
 i rushed out to get the ball and bring it inside now it 's in a big garbage bag and i ca n't stop laughing like a cartoon <unk> door to my room does n't close all the way cause the door hinge broke during one of our parties 
 this has <unk> my roommate to try and catch me during my happy time 
 he 'll quietly walk into the house after work or school creep up the steps and jump in screaming i <unk> 
 luckily i 'm under the covers so he does n't see anything but it 's still pretty annoying 
 he has <unk> 3 times in the past 2 months and yesterday i figured enough is enough 
 i get everything ready and <unk> his arrival from work 
 i saw him pull in and i run to my room and get into position 
 i do n't hear a thing which is normal so i know what he 's gon na do 
 the poor bastard barges in screaming <unk> bitch 
 to his surprise catches me <unk> without the cover with a shit ton of lotion on my hand and penis 
 i make eye contact with him the whole time and continue to <unk> staring into his soul 
 he immediately yells wtf 
 in his sort of <unk> surprise stance and freezes for a second 
 then immediately runs out into the hallway yelling that 's fucking disgusting man 
 he went into his room and i did n't see him till this morning 
 when i did all i said was it is i who got you bitch '' and continue to eat my pop <unk> it count as petty revenge if the target did n't specifically do anything to me personally 
 a few years ago i went back to school to get another <unk> because the first time around my <unk> could be <unk> called aggressively <unk> '' and i really wanted to go to grad school 
 my wife had a full time job at the time so i did n't need to get a part time job or anything but i get bored easily 
 i applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and was n't particularly demanding work 
 it was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the <unk> of various dorms on weekends and checking <unk> of incoming <unk> to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest 
 it was part of the campus safety initiative 
 most of the time i just sat there and studied since most of the <unk> was just after last <unk> is in canada so it 's pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age 
 occasionally i was asked to <unk> around campus and ticket cars that were <unk> parked 
 i did n't mind the walking but <unk> students never sat well with <unk> has money for that shit <unk> this was not my favorite part of the job 
 as an aside i tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard 
 fuck the man 
 anyway one day in the late <unk> above freezing but not by <unk> was outside the engineering building and i saw a <unk> bmw <unk> maybe it was an <unk> i do n't recall so i 'm just going to say it was an <unk> for <unk> in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags 
 as usual i approach the car slowly like i 'm sneaking up on it 
 i discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive 
 i 've found that no one actually likes the meter <unk> and a loud <unk> car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd 
 it 's better to sneak up on the car confirm that it is in fact illegally parked or has an expired pass walk away write the ticket and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper 
 & gt be me meter <unk> & gt use <unk> ticket & gt it is very effective i wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off 
 i did another walk around the rear parking lot and then because it was near the end of my shift i returned to that same building because there was a tim 's inside and i wanted to grab lunch and a coffee 
 i go inside get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke 
 i 'm standing by the smoking pawn do n't actually know what these things are <unk> in one hand sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket smoke in the other hand and just zone out 
 next thing i know there 's some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly 
 i zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the <unk> 
 he 's this skinny dude wearing a <unk> vest and he 's got fancy hair 
 i figure he 's probably 18 or 19 
 20 tops 
 he 's got the yellow envelope in one hand and he 's all fucking shit fuck fuck dick cunt shit fuck motherfucker etc '' 
 while he 's swearing and having a bit of a <unk> he 's also looking around presumably to see if the meter <unk> is still around so he can give him a piece of his mind 
 oh wait i 'm the meter <unk> 
 and i 'm like 30 feet away 
 still smoking 
 sandwich in my pocket coffee in the other hand parking ticket printer <unk> across my chest 
 well shit 
 & gt be me & gt be at the end of your shift & gt expect to be yelled at by <unk> vest fancy hair i steel myself for the <unk> tirade 
 policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations 
 our <unk> should <unk> of yes <unk> '' no <unk> '' i understand <unk> '' but overall being firm about why they received a ticket 
 he swings his vision around several times but does n't seem to spot me 
 i 'm not wearing anything <unk> other than the mandatory blue campus security jacket and a <unk> <unk> 
 he keeps looking around 
 left 
 right 
 left 
 right 
 i take another drag 
 for whatever reason he does n't see me 
 he angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car <unk> the car with his remote <unk> heads back into the <unk> 
 so i 'm still standing by the smoking pawn sandwich in my pocket <unk> medium <unk> old medium not the new <unk> <unk> one drag left on my smoke 
 so i finish my smoke feed the pawn and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich 
 i 'm sitting on the bench eating my sandwich drinking my coffee and staring at this <unk> that is still parked in the handicap space 
 i 'm gon na finish my sandwich drink my <unk> <unk> another <unk> and then i 'm going to give him another ticket '' says i to myself 
 it 's a trap '' replies my brain making a very good point 
 i dunno man this is too good of an opportunity to pass up '' 
 i 'm just saying '' how could it be a trap 
 what he has a gang of <unk> <unk> bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a dance off do whatever you want just no <unk> '' 
 my brain made a valid point 
 this would be an excellent trap 
 i pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth wash it down with my now <unk> <unk> and light up another <unk> <unk> light <unk> with the <unk> cigarette <unk> warning no <unk> stare at the entrance to the engineering building 
 no sign of <unk> vest fancy hair 
 with one hand i start typing out the ticket on the printer but do n't press the print '' button <unk> i hit the button it saves the data and there 's no way to <unk> it once that happens 
 i was n't yet ready to <unk> to this course of action 
 i finish my second cigarette pull out a yellow envelope take a breath and hit print '' as i start walking toward the car 
 the <unk> printer quickly spits out the ticket and i quickly <unk> the ticket into the envelope and <unk> it under the wiper 
 nothing happens 
 no <unk> 
 no screaming 
 no <unk> vest fancy hair 
 all that <unk> for nothing 
 i check my <unk> i recall correctly it was a <unk> flip phone of some <unk> shift ended a few minutes ago 
 i 'm not technically in any hurry to get back to the office we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so i 'm not preventing anyone from starting their shift by <unk> 
 i use the camera <unk> a whopping <unk> <unk> take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper 
 then i walk into the engineering building get another coffee and <unk> myself back in the designated smoking area and i hope that this kid is n't in a three hour class 
 i 'm now here for a show 
 i 'm going to get yelled at it 'll be a huge scene i 'll have to be all professional about it but seeing <unk> vest fancy hair have another <unk> is totally worth it 
 you 're an idiot '' says my brain 
 i let my coffee cool just for a bit before i take a swig 
 of course i forgot to check where the paper cup seam was and dribbled coffee down my <unk> 
 son of a bitch 
 i put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee <unk> from my <unk> just as i hear another stream of cunt fuck motherfucker what the fucking fuck '' <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> 
 who the fuck did this '' 
 what the fuck '' 
 there 's <unk> vest fancy hair : sack of fast food in one hand jumbo fountain drink in the <unk> to have the <unk> of a 19 <unk> <unk> 's <unk> around trying to find the meter <unk> again while swearing up a storm 
 he 's now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by 
 for some reason he still has n't spotted me 
 i 'm standing a mere 30 feet from where he is <unk> 
 i am right beside the smoking pawn wearing a blue jacket that says campus security '' on it 
 i have a printer <unk> over my shoulder and across my chest 
 for some reason his gaze never <unk> on me at all 
 after a few more seconds of <unk> he gets in his car throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away 
 why he did n't see me is <unk> 
 the only <unk> i have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else 
 maybe a high visibility vest or maybe something like this i dunno 
 i do n't recall how much those tickets run a few hundred i think but that kid had one expensive day 
 my boss did tell me that the kid 's father called in pretty pissed about the tickets 
 i had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because i figured he 'd probably ask my why i wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day 
 my boss explained to the kid 's father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle remove the ticket and leave it counted as a separate parking incident thus two tickets were <unk> 
 **tl dr guy in <unk> vest gets a double shot of karma for parking in handicap zone 
 <unk> : i posted this as a comment to someone else 's post and it was suggested to make it a new post 
 here you go 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- - people parking in my private parking space used to happen to me all the time at an apartment complex i lived in 
 here 's a pic for reference : my spot was the second spot on the left side of the lot where that red car is next to the empty space on the right end 
 the right end space was a co-worker which plays into the story 
 my spot even had a sign that said resident parking only 
 all others towed '' 
 except the manager never towed any cars even though i asked her multiple times 
 but she was nice to me so that was good 
 at the time i drove a <unk> <unk> <unk> pickup long bed which was a really big truck 
 it looked pretty much like this : but <unk> <unk> because broke college student fuck you very much and i was an idiot and why did i drive that 
 there was no guest parking 
 and there was never enough space for me to park on the street as it was always packed and my truck really did n't fit into normal spaces anyway 
 i 'd have to park a mile away or start yelling for whoever it was to move their car 
 so yeah at least once a week you could find me standing out in the parking lot yelling at the top of my lungs about some asshole and their car and move it and i am sure people laughed at my weekly meltdown 
 and sometimes nobody would come out to claim their car 
 of course this <unk> happened when i had come home from school and had to get changed to go to work 
 i did n't have time for this 
 one night i got home from work and someone was in my spot 
 i was tired of this shit so i simply parked my truck directly behind the asshole in my space and my co-worker see yellow <unk> area in first pic 
 my co-worker was also home so the asshole could not get out 
 going forward was a 15 drop and while i <unk> about pushing cars off the edge i never did 
 about an hour yes an hour 
 later someone comes knocking on my door 
 i did not open and asked what they wanted 
 they said i was blocking them in 
 i was <unk> that someone told them where i lived and i told them they were in my spot and there was a sign and they fucked up and to go away 
 a few minutes later they came back and i was even more mad and yelled at them and told them i would be gone tomorrow morning at 8am and they could get their car then 
 and to go the fuck away 
 my co-worker did n't mind as i checked with them beforehand and she just said she could just pull forward to get out of her space if she needed to 
 she said she decided to leave her car there though because it was awesome 
 they left defeated 
 i was worried i 'd get towed but nothing happened 
 this happened again a few times with the exact same outcome 
 no one knocked on my door though 
 after about two weeks all the other residents started doing the same thing 
 you 'd hear people yelling do n't park there you 'll get blocked in '' 
 when their friends would come over 
 after a month it never happened again 
 success 
 edit : <unk> 
 edit 2 : my follow up post with video : in my junior year at college i had two or three incidents of being woken up in the middle of the night by phone calls from the same drunken student 
 every dorm had a <unk> phone extension and i assume when he was drunk he would consistently <unk> or incorrectly remember someone 's number and enter mine instead 
 i would answer he would be almost totally <unk> i would hang up and go back to sleep 
 the way the phone system worked at the college there was no caller id from <unk> calls within the system ... unless it went to voicemail and the person left a message 
 in that case it would actually tell you what <unk> extension the call came from 
 so the last time it happened i let it go to voicemail and he was drunk enough to leave a <unk> message 
 i recorded the extension on a post it on my desk 
 for the remainder of that semester probably <unk> months i made it a point to dial this extension at 5:45 am every monday and thursday because i had to be up extra early those days for an <unk> research project i was doing 
 i 'd wait for him to pick up to make sure i 'd woken him and then hang up and continue with getting <unk> and dressed
